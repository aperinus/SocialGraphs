It is the second of five films in the original ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' series produced by [[Arthur P. Jacobs]].<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.mediacircus.net/pota.html| title=Those Damned Dirty Apes!| access-date=2011-08-03| publisher=www.mediacircus.net| archive-date=2011-07-22| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722200131/http://www.mediacircus.net/pota.html| url-status=live}}</ref> The film stars [[James Franciscus]], [[Kim Hunter]], [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]], and [[Linda Harrison (actress)|Linda Harrison]], and features [[Charlton Heston]] in a supporting role. Another spacecraft crashes on the planet ruled by apes, carrying astronaut Brent who searches for Taylor and discovers an underground city inhabited by mutated humans with advanced telekinetic abilities. ''Beneath the Planet of the Apes'' was a success at the box office but met with mixed reviews from critics. It was followed by ''[[Escape from the Planet of the Apes]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing the events of ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'', time-displaced astronaut [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Taylor|Taylor]] and the mute [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Nova|Nova]] ride horseback through the desert of the Forbidden Zone in search of a new life far away from Ape City. Without warning, fire shoots up from the ground and deep chasms open. Confused by the strange phenomenon, Taylor investigates a cliff wall and disappears through it before Nova's eyes. The phenomenon disappears, leaving Nova alone.\n\nElsewhere in the Forbidden Zone, a second Earth spaceship has crash-landed after being sent to search for Taylor and his crew. [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Brent|Brent]] and his Skipper are the only survivors, though the Skipper dies shortly after crashing. Brent, while noting he is in the year 3955, assumes he has travelled to another planet. After burying his Skipper, he encounters Nova and notices she is wearing Taylor's [[dog tag]]s. Hoping Taylor is still alive, he rides with her to Ape City, where he is shocked to discover the simian civilization. He observes the [[gorilla]] [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#General Ursus|General Ursus]] leading a rally for the apes to conquer the Forbidden Zone and use it as a potential food source, against the objections of the [[orangutan]] [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Dr Zaius|Dr. Zaius]]. Brent is wounded by a gorilla soldier and taken by Nova to the home of the [[Pan (genus)|chimpanzee]]s [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Cornelius|Cornelius]] and [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Zira|Zira]], who treat his wound and tell him of their time with Taylor. The humans hide when Dr. Zaius arrives and announces that he will accompany Ursus on the invasion of the Forbidden Zone.\n\nAttempting to flee the city, Brent and Nova are captured by gorillas. Ursus orders they be used for target practice, but Zira helps them escape. They hide in a cave which Brent soon discovers is the ruins of the [[Queensboro Plaza (New York City Subway)|Queensboro Plaza]] station of the [[New York City Subway]], realizing he traveled through time to Earth's post-apocalyptic future. After following a humming sound deeper into the tunnels, Brent becomes agitated and erratic and attempts to drown Nova as she drinks, quickly stopping and backing away to another room. Entering the remains of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]], he finds a population of [[telepathy|telepathic]] humans who worship an ancient [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]].\n\nBrent and Nova are captured and telepathically interrogated by the telepaths' leadership under [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#M\u00e9ndez|Mendez]]. They explain themselves to be the descendants of humans who survived a [[nuclear holocaust]] and mutated over generations. While claiming to be a peaceful society despite using mind-control and illusion on their enemies, the mutants force Brent into revealing the apes' march on the Forbidden Zone; but their attempts to repel the invaders with illusions of fire and other horrors ultimately fail when Zaius sees through it. With the apes closing in, the telepaths plan to detonate their \"Divine Bomb\" as a last resort, holding a religious ritual during which they remove their human-skinned masks to reveal their mutated pale skin with prominent large veins due to generations of radiation exposure.\n\nBrent is separated from Nova and taken to a cell where he finds Taylor. One mutant, explaining that they cannot let them leave the city alive, uses his telepathic powers to force Brent and Taylor to fight each other. Nova escapes her guard and runs to the cell, screaming her first word: \"Taylor!\" This breaks the mutant's concentration, freeing Brent and Taylor from his control long enough for them to overpower and kill the mutant. Brent describes the bomb the mutants worship to have Greek letters [[Alpha and Omega]] on its casing, and Taylor recognizes it as a [[Cobalt bomb|\"doomsday bomb\"]] capable of destroying the entire planet.\n\nThe apes invade the subterranean city, making their way to the cathedral; many of the mutants are either captured, killed, or found to have died by suicide. After Nova is killed in the midst of the chaos, Taylor and Brent reach the cathedral as M\u00e9ndez is shot dead after raising the bomb into activation position. The humans attempt to stop Ursus from accidentally setting off the weapon, but Taylor is shot as his pleas to Zaius fall on deaf ears. When Brent is gunned down after killing Ursus, the mortally wounded Taylor curses Zaius as he collapses and dies bringing his hand down on the activation switch triggering the bomb. The scene whites out, and [[voiceover]] narration states: \"In one of the countless billions of galaxies in the universe lies a medium-sized star, and one of its satellites, a green and insignificant planet, is now dead\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{col div}}\n* [[James Franciscus]] as Brent\n* [[Kim Hunter]] as Zira\n* [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]] as Dr. Zaius\n* [[Linda Harrison (actress)|Linda Harrison]] as Nova\n* [[Paul Richards (actor)|Paul Richards]] as Mendez\n* [[Victor Buono]] as Fat Man\n* [[James Gregory (actor)|James Gregory]] as General Ursus\n* [[Jeff Corey]] as Caspay\n* [[Natalie Trundy]] as Albina\n* [[Thomas Gomez]] as Minister\n* [[Don Pedro Colley]] as Negro\n* [[David Watson (actor)|David Watson]] as Cornelius\n* [[Tod Andrews]] as Skipper\n* [[Gregory Sierra]] as Verger\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as Taylor\n* [[Paul Frees]] (uncredited end narration)\n{{col div end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\nSoon after ''Planet of the Apes'' became a hit, a sequel started being considered by 20th Century Fox. Screenwriter [[Rod Serling]] was consulted, but his ideas did not interest the studio. Then the producers turned to the author of the [[Planet of the Apes (novel)|original novel]], [[Pierre Boulle]], who wrote a draft for a sequel called ''Planet of the Men'', where protagonist George Taylor would lead an uprising of the enslaved men to take back control from the apes as the gorilla general Ursus wants to fight humans. Boulle's script was rejected as it was felt that it lacked the \"visual shock and the surprise\" of the original. Associate producer [[Mort Abrahams]] then wrote story elements, and British writer [[Paul Dehn]] was hired to develop them into a script, tentatively called ''Planet of the Apes Revisited''. Dehn implemented his trauma of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|1945 atomic bombings]] and the fear of [[nuclear warfare]] on the story. One of the elements thought up by Abrahams and Dehn was a half-human, half-ape child, but despite even going through make-up tests this was dropped due to the implication of [[bestiality]].<ref name=alpha>\"From Alpha to Omega: Building a Sequel\", ''Beneath the Planet of the Apes'' Blu-ray</ref> According to screenwriter Dehn the idea for ''Beneath the Planet of the Apes'' came about from the end of the first movie which suggested that New York City was buried underground.<ref>Russo, Joe and Landsman, Larry with Gross, Edward ''Planet of The Apes Revisited'', 2001, pg. pg. 103. Thomas Dunne Books</ref>\n\nAlthough Charlton Heston showed little interest in reprising his role as Taylor, studio head [[Richard D. Zanuck]] thought the actor was essential to the sequel. After some disagreement with the actor's agents, Heston agreed to briefly appear with the provision that his character be killed and that his pay go to charity. The writers decided to have Taylor disappear at the story's start and only return by the film's ending, and have a new protagonist for the major part of the story.<ref>Russo, Joe and Landsman, Larry with Gross, Edward ''Planet of The Apes Revisited'', 2001. Thomas Dunne Books</ref> [[James Franciscus]] accepted the role of Brent as a break from his usual TV fare.<ref name=alpha/>\n\nDirector [[Franklin J. Schaffner]] was invited to return to the series, but declined due to a commitment to ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]''. Television and film director [[Ted Post]] was approached, and while objecting to the script for \"not making a point at all\", the producers asked what he did not like. Post then wrote a letter saying that \"the loss of a planet is the loss of all hope\". Post tried to get the other writer of the original, [[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]], but a budget cut prevented him from doing so. Post and Franciscus \u2013 who wanted to help clarify the actions of and give depth to the character of Brent \u2013 spent a week rewriting the script, leading to over fifty pages of notes suggesting story ideas to fix some of the narrative problems in Paul Dehn's script.<ref name=alpha/><ref>Russo, Joe and Landsman, Larry with Gross, Edward ''Planet of The Apes Revisited'', 2001, pg. 105. Thomas Dunne Books</ref>\n\n[[Roddy McDowall]] could not return for his role in this sequel, because he was in [[Scotland]] directing ''[[Tam-Lin (film)|Tam Lin]]''. Actor David Watson portrayed Cornelius in this film with McDowall only appearing briefly in clips from the first film used during ''Beneath'''s pre-title sequence.<ref>BEHIND THE PLANET OF THE APES documentary, in the DVD box sets.</ref> Along with the animated series ''[[Return to the Planet of the Apes]]'', this film is one of only two 1970s ''Planet of the Apes'' productions in which McDowall does not appear. [[Orson Welles]] was offered the role of General Ursus, but he turned it down objecting against spending all his screentime in a mask and make-up. The part ultimately went to [[James Gregory (actor)|James Gregory]].<ref name=alpha/>\n\nBefore Zanuck was fired as studio president during production, he suggested that Post add an element suggested by Heston, the Alpha Omega doomsday bomb, to end the series. However, before the film's release, the producers were considering ideas for another sequel.<ref name=alpha/>\n\n===Filming===\nProduction began in February 1969. The sequel, now titled ''Beneath the Planet of the Apes'', had its budget reduced from $5&nbsp;million to $2.5&nbsp;million because Fox had suffered recently from several underperforming big-budget films, like ''[[Star! (film)|Star!]]'', ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' and ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]''{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} Nonetheless, the studio expected the film to return Fox to profitability.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} Heston's parts were filmed in just eight days.<ref name=alpha/>  The sets of the mutants' council chamber and the temple of the bomb were redresses of the [[Grand Central \u2013 42nd Street (New York City Subway)|Grand Central \u2013 42nd Street]] station and hotel lobby sets from the film ''Hello, Dolly!''<ref>''[http://pota.goatley.com/magazines/cinefantastique-summer-1972.pdf 'Cinefantastique Planet of the Apes Issue' (1972)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716154005/http://pota.goatley.com/magazines/cinefantastique-summer-1972.pdf |date=2012-07-16 }}''</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe original ''Apes'' composer, [[Jerry Goldsmith]], was invited to write the score for the sequel, but Schaffner was using Goldsmith for ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]''.

These re-recorded pieces were interspersed with dialogue taken from the film. The soundtrack featured some of the leading Los Angeles studio musicians of the time, including bassist [[Carol Kaye]] and [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]] pioneer [[Paul Beaver]].<ref>[http://www.globaldogproductions.info/a/amos.html ''45 Discography for Amos Records''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017070523/http://globaldogproductions.info/a/amos.html |date=2012-10-17 }} - Global Dog Productions</ref>\n\nA short sequence of [[diegetic music]] features in the scene set in the ruins of St. Patrick's Cathedral, in which the telepaths are heard singing a dystopian hymn in praise of the atom bomb. For this scene, Rosenman composed a discordant setting of [[Cecil Frances Alexander]]'s 1848 Christian hymn \"[[All Things Bright and Beautiful]]\", with the lyrics altered to pay homage to the \"Bomb Almighty\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Spencer |first1=Kristopher |title=Film and Television Scores, 1950-1979: A Critical Survey by Genre |date=10 January 2014 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-5228-6 |page=189 |url=https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Film_and_Television_Scores_1950_1979/Wz2dxDNaEDgC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22all+things+bright+and+beautiful%22+Beneath+the+Planet+of+the+Apes&pg=PA189&printsec=frontcover |access-date=3 March 2021 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Tony |title=Film Score: The View from the Podium |year=1979 |publisher=A.

Ursus is horrified, telling Zaius that he has emptied the pistol into Taylor; he should be dead, but he still lives.
