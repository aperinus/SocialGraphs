It was produced by Burton and [[Denise Di Novi]], written by [[Caroline Thompson]] from a story by her and Burton, and starring [[Johnny Depp]], [[Winona Ryder]], [[Anthony Michael Hall]], [[Dianne Wiest]], [[Kathy Baker]], [[Alan Arkin]], and [[Vincent Price]]. It tells the story of an unfinished artificial humanoid who has scissor blades instead of hands that is taken in by a [[suburb]]an family and falls in love with their teenage daughter.\n\nBurton conceived ''Edward Scissorhands'' from his childhood upbringing in suburban [[Burbank, California]]. During [[pre-production]] of ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', [[Caroline Thompson]] was hired to adapt Burton's story into a screenplay, and the film began development at [[20th Century Fox]] after [[Warner Bros.]] declined. ''Edward Scissorhands'' was then [[wikt:fast track|fast tracked]] after Burton's critical and financial success with ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''. The film also marks the fourth collaboration between Burton and [[film score]] composer [[Danny Elfman]], and was Vincent Price's last major role.\n\n''Edward Scissorhands'' was released to a positive reception from critics and was a financial success, grossing over four times its $20&nbsp;million budget. The film received numerous nominations at the [[Academy Award]]s, [[British Academy Film Award]]s, and the [[Saturn Award]]s, as well as winning the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]]. Both Burton and Elfman consider ''Edward Scissorhands'' their most personal and favorite work.\n\n==Plot==\nOne evening, an elderly woman tells her granddaughter the bedtime story of a young man named Edward who has scissor blades for hands. The creation of an old inventor, Edward is an ageless humanoid who was almost completed. The inventor homeschooled Edward, but suffered a heart attack and died before giving Edward real hands, leaving him permanently unfinished.\n\nMany years later, Peg Boggs, a local door-to-door [[Avon Products|Avon]] saleswoman, tries to sell at the decrepit [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] mansion where Edward lives. She finds him alone and offers to take him to her home after discovering he is virtually harmless. Peg introduces Edward to her husband Bill, their young son Kevin, and their teenage daughter Kim. Edward falls in love with Kim, despite her initial fear of him. As their neighbors are curious about the new houseguest, the Boggs throw a neighborhood barbecue welcoming him. Most of the neighbors are fascinated by Edward and befriend him, except for the eccentric [[Religious fanaticism|religious fanatic]] Esmeralda and Kim's boyfriend Jim.\n\nEdward repays the neighborhood for their kindness by trimming their hedges into [[Topiary|topiaries]], progressing to grooming dogs and later styling the hair of the neighborhood women. One of the neighbors, Joyce, offers to help Edward open a hair salon. While scouting a location, Joyce attempts to seduce him, but scares him away. Joyce lies to the neighborhood women about it, reducing their trust in him. The bank denies Edward a loan as he does not have a background or financial history.\n\nJealous of Kim's attraction to Edward, Jim suggests Edward pick the lock on his parents' home to obtain a van for Jim and Kim. Edward agrees, but when he picks the lock, a burglar alarm is triggered. Jim flees and Edward is arrested. The police determine that a lifetime of isolation has left Edward without any sense of reality or common sense. Edward takes responsibility for the robbery, telling Kim he did it because she asked him to. Consequently, he is shunned by the entire neighborhood except for the Boggs family.\n\nAt Christmas, Edward carves an angelic ice sculpture modeled after Kim; the ice shavings are thrown into the air and fall like snow, something that never happened before. Kim dances in the snowfall. Jim arrives suddenly, calling out to Edward, surprising him and causing him to accidentally cut Kim's hand. Jim accuses Edward of intentionally harming her, but Kim, disgusted and fed up with Jim's jealous behavior towards Edward, breaks up with him. Meanwhile, Edward flees in a rage, destroying his works and scaring Esmeralda until he is calmed by a wandering dog.\n\nKim's parents go out to find Edward while she stays behind in case he returns. Edward returns, finding Kim there. She asks him to hold her, but Edward hesitates, afraid of hurting her. Jim's drunken friend drives him to Kim's house and nearly runs over Kevin, but Edward pushes Kevin to safety while inadvertently cutting him. Witnesses accuse Edward of attacking Kevin; when Jim assaults him, Edward defends himself, cutting Jim's arm before fleeing to his mansion.\n\nKim races after Edward while Jim obtains a handgun and follows Kim. In the mansion, Jim ambushes Edward and fights with him. Edward refuses to fight back until he sees Jim slap Kim as she attempts to intervene. Enraged, Edward stabs Jim in the chest and pushes him from a window of the mansion, killing him. Kim confesses her love to Edward and kisses him before she departs, leaving Edward alone. As the neighbors gather, Kim convinces them that Jim and Edward killed each other.\n\nThe elderly woman, revealed to be Kim, finishes telling her granddaughter the story and says that she never saw Edward again, so that Edward would remember her as she was in her youth. She believes he is still alive because it would not be snowing without him. Edward is then seen carving ice sculptures of his experiences with Kim, with the bits of ice floating as snow in the wind.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as Edward Scissorhands\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as Kim Boggs\n* [[Anthony Michael Hall]] as Jim\n* [[Dianne Wiest]] as Peg Boggs\n* [[Kathy Baker]] as Joyce Monroe\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Bill Boggs\n* [[Vincent Price]] as The Inventor\n* [[Robert Oliveri]] as Kevin Boggs\n* [[Conchata Ferrell]] as Helen\n* [[Caroline Aaron]] as Marge\n* [[Dick Anthony Williams]] as Officer Allen\n* [[O-Lan Jones]] as Esmeralda\n* [[Nick Carter (singer)|Nick Carter]] as [[Slip 'N Slide]] Kid (uncredited)<ref name=\"DVD\">DVD production notes</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe genesis of ''Edward Scissorhands'' came from a drawing by then-teenaged director [[Tim Burton]], which reflected his feelings of isolation and being unable to communicate to people around him in suburban [[Burbank, California|Burbank]]. The drawing depicted a thin, solemn man with long, sharp blades for fingers. Burton stated that he was often alone and had trouble retaining friendships. \"I get the feeling people just got this urge to want to leave me alone for some reason, I don't know exactly why.\" During [[pre-production]] of ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', Burton hired [[Caroline Thompson]], then a young novelist, to write the ''Edward Scissorhands'' screenplay as a [[spec script]]. Burton was impressed with her short novel, ''First Born'', which was \"about an [[abortion]] that came back to life\". Burton felt ''First Born'' had the same psychological elements he wanted to showcase in ''Edward Scissorhands''.<ref name=Burbank/> \"Every detail was so important to Tim because it was so personal\", Thompson remarked.<ref name=concept/> She wrote ''Scissorhands'' as a \"[[love poem]]\" to Burton, calling him \"the most articulate person I know, but couldn't put a single sentence together\".<ref>{{cite news | author = Donna Foote; David Ansen | title = The Disembodied Director | work = [[Newsweek]] | date = 1991-01-21}}</ref>\n\nShortly after Thompson's hiring, Burton began to develop ''Edward Scissorhands'' at [[Warner Bros.]], with whom he worked on ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'' and ''[[Beetlejuice]]''. However, within a couple of months, Warner sold the [[film rights]] to [[20th Century Fox]].<ref>{{cite news | author = John Evan Frook | url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR105853 | title = Canton Product at Colpix starting gate | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1993-04-13 | access-date = 2008-12-04 | archive-date = 2012-11-05 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121105163903/http://www.variety.com/article/VR105853 | url-status = live }}</ref> Fox agreed to finance Thompson's screenplay while giving Burton complete creative control.

A mob confronts the \"evil creature\", in this case, Edward, at his castle. With Edward unable to consummate his love for Kim because of his appearance, the film can also be seen as being influenced by ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''.
