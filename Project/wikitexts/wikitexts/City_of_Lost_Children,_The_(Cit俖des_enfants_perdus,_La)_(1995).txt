At his lair on an abandoned oil rig (which he shares with the scientist's other creations: six childish clones, a dwarf named Martha, and a [[brain in a vat]] named Irvin) he uses a dream-extracting machine to steal dreams from children. The children are kidnapped for him from a nearby port city by a cyborg cult called the Cyclops, who in exchange he supplies with mechanical eyes and ears. Among the kidnapped is Denree (Joseph Lucien), the adopted little brother of carnival strongman One ([[Ron Perlman]]).\n\nAfter the carnival manager is stabbed by a mugger, One is hired by a criminal gang of orphans (run by a pair of [[Siamese twins|conjoined twins]] called \"the Octopus\") to help them steal a safe. The theft is successful, but the safe is lost in the harbor when One is distracted by seeing Denree's kidnappers. He, together with one of the orphans, a little girl called Miette ([[Judith Vittet]]), follows the Cyclops and infiltrates their headquarters, but they are captured and sentenced to execution. Meanwhile, the Octopus orders circus performer Marcello ([[Jean-Claude Dreyfus]]) to return One to them. He uses his trained fleas, which inject a poison capsule that causes mindless aggression, to turn the Cyclops guards against each other. While Marcello is rescuing One, Miette falls into the harbor and sinks, seemingly drowned, but an amnesiac diver living beneath the harbor rescues her.\n\nMiette leaves the diver's lair to find One and Marcello both drowning their sorrows in a bar. Upon seeing Miette alive the remorseful Marcello lets One leave with her. However the Octopus confronts them on the pier, and uses Marcello's stolen fleas to turn One against Miette. A spectacular chain of events triggered by one of Miette's tears leads to a ship crashing into the pier before One can throttle her. Marcello arrives and sets the fleas on the Octopus, allowing One and Miette to escape to continue searching for Denree.\n\nBack at Krank's oil rig, Irvin tricks one of the clones into releasing a plea for help in the form of a bottled dream telling the story of what is going on on the oil rig. It reaches One, Miette, and the diver, and the latter remembers that he was the scientist who made them, and that the oil rig was his laboratory before Krank and Martha attacked him and pushed him off it to take it for themselves, leaving him for dead in the water. They all converge on the rig; the diver to destroy it and the duo to rescue Denree.\n\nMiette is almost killed by Martha, but the diver harpoons her. She then finds Denree asleep in Krank's dream-extracting machine, and Irvin tells her that to release him she must use the machine to enter the dream herself. In the dream world, she meets Krank and makes a deal with him to replace the boy as the source of the dream; Krank fears a trap but plays along, believing himself to be in control. Miette then uses her imagination to control the dream and turn it into an infinite loop, destroying Krank's mind. One and Miette rescue all the children, while the now-deranged diver loads the rig with dynamite and straps himself to one of its legs. The diver regains his senses as everyone is rowing away and pleads with his remaining creations to come back to rescue him, but a seabird lands on the handle of the [[blasting machine]], blowing up him and the rig.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ron Perlman]] as One\n* [[Judith Vittet]] as Miette\n* [[Daniel Emilfork]] as Krank\n* Joseph Lucien as Denree\n* [[Dominique Pinon]] as the diver and the clones\n* Genevi\u00e8ve Brunet and Odile Mallet (n\u00e9e Odile Antoinette Brunet) as the Octopus \n* [[Jean-Claude Dreyfus]] as Marcello\n* [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] as Uncle Irvin (voice)\n* Mireille Moss\u00e9 as Martha\n* [[Rufus (actor)|Rufus]] as Peeler\n* [[Serge Merlin]] as the chief of the Cyclops\n* [[Marc Caro]] as Brother Ange-Joseph\n* [[Ticky Holgado]] as an ex-acrobat\n* [[Lorella Cravotta]] as The woman at her window\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film holds a 79% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 57 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10.

On the other hand, it exposes the deplorable effects of capitalism ... the exploitation of childhood (the cynical orphans), of tenderness (the Original scientist, attacked and turned out by his own beloved creations), and of innocence (the terrified children whose dreams are stolen) while suggesting that there is no place in capitalism for originality, disinterestedness, duty, self-reflective analysis, and other defining aspects of \"the human\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Webb|first1=Jen|last2=Schirato|first2=Tony|title=Disenchantment and the City Of Lost Children|journal=Canadian Journal of Film Studies|date=2004|volume=13|issue=1|pages=55\u201368|jstor=24405638|doi=10.3138/cjfs.13.1.55|doi-access=free}}</ref>}}\n\nAccording to author Donna Wilkerson-Barker, these elusive aspects of humanity are presented within the film for various characters to identify with. For example, the relationship between One and Denr\u00e9e represents, for Miette, a family of authenticity. Prepared to sacrifice her life in order to become a part of their family, Miette helps One to save Denr\u00e9e from Krank's manipulative environment. In another example, Irvin the brain plays his part in overturning the same environment in order to liberate his \"family\" of clones. In the end, two boats filled with these two different families row towards their futures: In one boat, a technologically produced family of Irvin and the clones; In the other, a rationally envisioned family containing Miette, One, and the abducted children. This leaves the audience to question precisely what the future will hold for these two differing visions of humanity.<ref name=wilk>{{cite journal|last1=Wilkerson-Barker|first1=Donna|title=The Dream Scene and the Future of Vision in 'The City of Lost Children' and 'Until the End of the World'|journal=CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture|date=2007|volume=9|issue=3|page=7|doi=10.7771/1481-4374.1225|language=en|issn=1481-4374|doi-access=free}}{{open access}}</ref>\n\nAs ''The City of Lost Children'' \"proceeds in full awareness that the past to which it is committed never really existed\", the film has been classified as an example of the [[steampunk]] genre.<ref>{{cite thesis|author-last=Cohen|author-first=Noam S.|title=Speculative Nostalgias: Metafiction, Science Fiction and the Putative Death of the Novel|chapter=The Curious Case of Steampunk|page=169|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|location=Stanford, CA|id=Document No. 3332811{{ProQuest|304470235}}|via=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|degree=Ph.D.}}</ref>\n\n==Video game==\n{{main|The City of Lost Children (video game)}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{commons category-inline}}\n* {{Wikiquote-inline}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/thecityoflostchildren/}}\n* {{IMDb title|0112682|The City of Lost Children}}\n* {{mojo title|cityoflostchildren|The City of Lost Children}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|city_of_lost_children|The City of Lost Children}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=The City of Lost Children}}\n\n{{Jean-Pierre Jeunet}}\n{{Marc Caro}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:City Of Lost Children, The}}\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1995 fantasy films]]\n[[Category:1990s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:Cantonese-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about cloning]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Marc Caro]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Angelo Badalamenti]]\n[[Category:Films shot in France]]\n[[Category:1990s French-language films]]\n[[Category:French dark fantasy films]]\n[[Category:French science fiction films]]\n[[Category:German fantasy films]]\n[[Category:German science fiction films]]\n[[Category:Science fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Mad scientist films]]\n[[Category:Magic realism films]]\n[[Category:Spanish dark fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Spanish science fiction films]]\n[[Category:Steampunk films]]\n[[Category:1990s French films]]\n[[Category:1990s German films]]\n[[Category:1990s Spanish films]]"}]}}}}
