Brooks]], adapted from [[Larry McMurtry]]'s [[Larry McMurtry#Houston series|1975 novel of the same name]]. It stars [[Debra Winger]], [[Shirley MacLaine]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Jeff Daniels]], and [[John Lithgow]]. The film covers 30 years of the relationship between Aurora Greenway (MacLaine) and her daughter Emma (Winger).\n\n''Terms of Endearment'' was theatrically released in limited theatres on November 23, 1983 and to a wider release on December 9 by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film received critical acclaim and was a major commercial success, grossing $165 million at the box office, becoming the [[1983 in film|second-highest-grossing film of 1983]]. The film received a leading eleven nominations at the [[56th Academy Awards]], and won five (more than any other film nominated that year): [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for MacLaine), [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (for Nicholson). A sequel, ''[[The Evening Star]]'', was released in 1996.\n\n==Plot==\nWidowed Aurora Greenway keeps several suitors at arm's length in [[River Oaks, Houston]], focusing instead on her close, but controlling, relationship with daughter Emma. Anxious to escape her mother, Emma marries callow young college professor Flap Horton over her mother's objections. Despite their frequent spats and difficulty getting along with each other, Emma and Aurora have very close ties and keep in touch by telephone.\n\nEmma and Flap move to Iowa in order for him to pursue a career as an English professor, but they run into financial difficulties. Emma has three children, and over the course of the next few years the marriage begins to fray. While at the grocery store, Emma does not have the money to pay for her groceries and meets Sam Burns, who pays for them. They strike up a friendship and quickly an affair as Sam's wife refuses to have sex with him and Emma suspects Flap of infidelity.  Meanwhile, the lonely Aurora overcomes her repression and begins a whirlwind romance with her next-door neighbor, retired [[astronaut]] Garrett Breedlove. Emma catches Flap flirting with one of his students and drives back to Texas immediately. There, Garret develops cold feet about his relationship with Aurora and breaks it off. While Emma is gone, Flap decides to take a promotion in Nebraska, Emma and the children return to Iowa and they move there.\n\nEmma finds out Flap moved them to Nebraska so he could work with his girlfriend. Emma is diagnosed with cancer, which becomes terminal. Aurora and Flap stay by Emma's side through her treatment and hospitalization. Garret flies to Nebraska to be with Aurora and the family during this. The dying Emma shows her love for her mother by entrusting her children to Aurora's care.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Shirley MacLaine]] as Aurora Greenway\n* [[Debra Winger]] as Emma Greenway-Horton\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as Garrett Breedlove\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as Vernon Dalhart\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Flap Horton\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Sam Burns\n* Lisa Hart Carroll as Patsy Clark\n* [[Huckleberry Fox]] as Ted \"Teddy\" Horton\n* Troy Bishop as Tom \"Tommy\" Horton\n* Shane Sherwin as Tom \"Tommy\" Horton (toddler)\n* Megan Morris as Melanie Horton\n* Tara Yeakey as Melanie Horton (infant)\n* Kate Charleson as Janice\n* [[Albert Brooks]], the voice of Rudyard, Aurora's husband\n* [[Mary Kay Place]] as Doris (voice)\n* [[David Wohl (actor)|David Wohl]] as Phil\n* [[Paul Menzel]] as Dr. Maise\n* Betty King as Rosie\n}}\n\n==Production==\nBrooks wrote the supporting role of Garrett Breedlove for [[Burt Reynolds]], who turned down the role because of a verbal commitment he had made to appear in ''[[Stroker Ace]]''. \"There are no awards in Hollywood for being an idiot\", Reynolds later said of the decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0002/23/lkl.00.html|title=Larry King Live:Burt Reynolds Discusses His Career in Showbiz|date=February 23, 2000|access-date=September 17, 2013|archive-date=April 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404050403/http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0002/23/lkl.00.html|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Paul Newman]] also turned down the role.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=McqLdkUnTVgC&pg=PA130|title = Harrison Ford: The Films|isbn = 9780786440481|last1 = Duke|first1 = Brad|date = July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1SqXAAAAQBAJ&q=terms+of+endearment+paul+newman+harrison+ford+turned+down&pg=PA237|title = Casting Might-Have-Beens: A Film by Film Directory of Actors Considered for Roles Given to Others|isbn = 9781476609768|last1 = Mell|first1 = Eila|date = January 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe exterior shots of Aurora Greenway's home were filmed at 3060 Locke Lane, Houston, Texas.
