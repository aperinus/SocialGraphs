The screenplay is written by [[Moira Buffini]] based on [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s [[Jane Eyre|1847 novel of the same name]], a classic of the [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]], [[bildungsroman]], and [[romance novel|romance]] genres.\n\nThe film was released on 11 March 2011 in the United States and 9 September in Great Britain and Ireland. It received positive reviews from critics. The film's costume design, led by [[Michael O'Connor (costume designer)|Michael O'Connor]], was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Academy Award]].<ref name=\"auto\">[http://www.awardsdaily.com/2012/01/2012-oscar-nominations-tba/ \"Hugo leads 2012 Oscar Nominations with 11\"]. ''Oscars''. Retrieved 26 January 2012.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA tearful [[Jane Eyre (character)|Jane Eyre]] runs away from [[Thornfield Hall]], finding herself alone on the [[Moorland|moors]]. She collapses at the doorstep of Moor House, home of St. John Rivers and his sisters Diana and Mary; they take Jane in and nurse her back to health.\n\nThe film flashes between Jane's recovery and her grim childhood. An orphan, she is treated cruelly by her cousin John and aunt Mrs. Reed. Jane is sent to the Lowood School for Girls; under the strict Mr. Brocklehurst, the girls are beaten, but Jane befriends fellow pupil Helen Burns, who dies of [[tuberculosis|consumption]].\n\nEight years later, Jane, now 18, leaves Lowood for a position at Thornfield Hall. Welcomed by the kindly housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax, Jane begins a plain and isolated life as [[governess]] to Ad\u00e8le Varens, the young French ward of Thornfield's owner. One day, Jane sees a rider thrown by his horse and comes to his aid. Returning to Thornfield, she learns the man is Edward Rochester, master of the house. He grudgingly praises her instruction of Ad\u00e8le, and her own \"openess and unpolluted mind;\u201d the two find themselves curiously attracted to one another.\n\nOne night, Jane discovers Rochester's room on fire, which they manage to extinguish; he warns her not to speak of the incident, and they share a chaste but passionate moment. The next day, Rochester leaves suddenly to call on Blanche Ingram, who Mrs. Fairfax tells Jane is Rochester's prospective wife; she and her family return with him a few weeks later on a grand visit to Thornfield.\n \nRochester confronts Jane, who is hurt by Blanche's presence, but is interrupted by an unexpected guest \u2013 Richard Mason from [[Spanish Town]], [[Jamaica]], whose arrival disturbs Rochester. That night, the household is awakened by a scream. Rochester reassures the guests, but brings Jane to tend to Mason, who has been badly injured. Jane notices a hidden door in Rochester's room before Mason is taken away by a doctor. Rochester confides in Jane, cryptically, that he is haunted by a past mistake but has fallen for a new woman in his life; Jane believes he means Blanche.\n\nJane receives word that her cousin John has committed suicide, leading her aunt to suffer a stroke. Jane returns to her dying aunt, who gives her a letter from Jane's paternal uncle, John Eyre, asking that Jane live with him in [[Madeira]] as his heir. The letter is three years old, and Mrs. Reed admits to writing to John to the effect that Jane had died at Lowood. Jane forgives her aunt and returns to Thornfield, beginning a correspondence with John.\n \nFaced with Rochester's impending marriage to Blanche, Jane tells Rochester she will leave Thornfield and confesses her true feelings for him. Rochester declares that Jane is his only love and proposes; she accepts. At their wedding, Mason appears with a lawyer and reveals that Rochester is already married to Mason's sister, [[Bertha Mason|Bertha]]. Rochester admits the truth and takes Jane to meet his violently deranged wife, kept in a hidden room at Thornfield. Rochester explains that he was made to marry Bertha for her money, but she rapidly descended into madness and he locked her away rather than subject her to an asylum; she was responsible for the strange happenings in the house. Jane, wounded at his deception, leaves Thornfield.\n\nAfter her recovery at Moor House, St. John gives Jane a teaching position and a cottage. One night, she imagines a knock at her door to be Rochester, but instead finds St. John with news that her uncle John has died and left her his fortune of \u00a320,000 ({{Inflation|UK|20000|1847|r=-5|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}). Jane offers to share her inheritance with St. John and his sisters, and the four live together at Moor House. St. John asks Jane to marry him and go to India as missionaries, but she rejects him.\n\nJane returns to Thornfield to find the house a blackened ruin. She learns from Mrs. Fairfax that Bertha set fire to the house; Rochester was able to rescue everyone but his wife. Jane visits Rochester, now blind, and the two are reunited.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Mia Wasikowska]] as [[Jane Eyre (character)|Jane Eyre]]\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Edward Rochester|Edward Fairfax Rochester]]\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as St. John Rivers\n* [[Judi Dench]] as Mrs Fairfax\n* [[Sally Hawkins]] as Mrs Reed\n* [[Holliday Grainger]] as Diana Rivers\n* [[Tamzin Merchant]] as Mary Rivers\n* [[Simon McBurney]] as Mr Brocklehurst\n* [[Imogen Poots]] as Blanche Ingram\n* [[Sophie Ward]] as Lady Ingram\n* [[Su Elliot]] as Hannah\n* [[Jayne Wisener]] as Bessie Lee\n* Amelia Clarkson as young Jane\n* Romy Settbon Moore as Ad\u00e8le Varens\n* Freya Parks as Helen Burns\n* [[Harry Lloyd]] as Richard Mason\n* [[Valentina Cervi]] as [[Bertha Mason|Bertha Antoinetta Mason]]\n* [[Craig Roberts]] as John Reed\n* [[Ben Roberts (actor)|Ben Roberts]] as Briggs\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced by [[Alison Owen]]'s company Ruby Films, with financial support from [[BBC Films]], [[Focus Features]] and Lipsynch Productions.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120805045057/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4de87b4ec190e BFI: ''Jane Eyre''] Linked 2013-12-24</ref> The script by [[Moira Buffini]] appeared on the 2008 Brit List, a film-industry-compiled list of the best unproduced screenplays in British film.<ref>{{cite news |author=Thomas, Archie |title=Brit List brings scripts to light |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117993429.html?categoryid=2523&cs=1 |work=Variety|date=3 October 2008 |access-date =8 April 2010}}</ref> The story is largely presented by way of flashbacks.<ref name=\"ahotm\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/06/movies/06eyre.html |title=Another Hike on the Moors for 'Jane Eyre' |date=4 March 2011 |work=The New York Times |first=Charles |last=McGrath |access-date =10 March 2011}}</ref> In October 2009, it was announced that [[Cary Fukunaga]] would direct the adaptation.<ref name=\"varietyoct09\">{{cite web |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118010174.html?categoryid=3768&cs=1 |title=Fukunaga near 'Jane Eyre' redo |date=20 October 2009 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Ali |last=Jaafar |access-date =18 March 2010}}</ref> Fukunaga had been in England promoting a film when he met with the BBC and learned about their plans for a new adaptation.<ref name=\"blastje\">{{cite news | last = Coombs | first = Molly J. | url = http://blastmagazine.com/the-magazine/entertainment/movies/jane-eyre-director-cary-fukunaga-and-star-mia-wasikowska-the-blast-interview/ | title = Jane Eyre director Cary Fukunaga and star Mia Wasikowska \u2013 The Blast Interview | date = 12 March 2011 | work = [[BLAST (magazine)|BLAST]] | access-date =12 March 2011}}</ref> The filmmakers decided to play up the [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] elements of the classic novel.<ref name=\"varietynov09\">{{cite web |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118011645.html?categoryId=2431&cs=1 |title=Wasikowska in talks for 'Jane Eyre' |date=19 November 2009 |work=Variety|first=Ali |last=Jaafar |access-date =18 March 2010}}</ref> Fukunaga stated, \"I've spent a lot of time rereading the book and trying to feel out what Charlotte Bront\u00eb was feeling when she was writing it.
