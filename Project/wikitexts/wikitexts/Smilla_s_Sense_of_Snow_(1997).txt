Based on the 1992 novel ''[[Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow]]'' (this was also the title of the UK release of the film) by [[Denmark|Danish]] author [[Peter H\u00f8eg]], the film is about a transplanted Greenlander, Smilla Jaspersen, who investigates the mysterious death of a small [[Inuit]] boy who lived in her housing complex in Copenhagen. Suspecting wrongdoing, Smilla uncovers a trail of clues leading towards a secretive corporation that has made several mysterious expeditions to Greenland.<ref>{{cite web|title=Smilla's Sense of Snow|website=Internet Movie Database|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120152/|access-date=10 March 2021}}</ref>\n\nScenes from the film were shot in Copenhagen; [[Kiruna]], Sweden; and western Greenland. The film was entered into the [[47th Berlin International Film Festival]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1997/02_programm_1997/02_Programm_1997.html|title=Berlinale: 1997 Programme|publisher=Berlinale|access-date=10 March 2021}}</ref> at which August was nominated for the [[Golden Bear]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1859, a meteorite streaks across the sky and crashes into the Gela Alta glacier in western [[Greenland]], causing a massive explosion that kills an [[Inuit]] fisherman.\n\nIn present-day [[Copenhagen]], Smilla Jaspersen, a transplanted Greenlander, is studying ice crystals at a university lab. Although an Arctic ice specialist, Smilla has not completed her credentials and is unemployed, with a troubled past. <!-- Why mention if not explained? -->When she returns to her apartment complex at the end of the day, she finds the body of six-year-old Isaiah Christiansen, a neighbor [[Inuit]] boy. He is lying in the snow by the edge of the building. The police say that he must have been playing and fallen from the roof. Smilla knew he was afraid of heights and, on the roof, sees that his footprints show he ran straight to the edge of the roof, as if threatened.\n\nAt the morgue Smilla meets with Dr. Lagermann. She is surprised when he tells her that a prominent professor, Dr. Johannes Loyen, performed the autopsy on the boy, who was from a poor working-class family. When she consults with Loyen the next day, he declares the boy's death to be an accident. Unconvinced, Smilla files a complaint with the District Attorney. She goes to Lagermann's home seeking more information, and he says that he found a puncture wound on the boy's thigh, made by a [[biopsy]] needle after his death. He also says that Loyen was examining the boy every month.\n\nAt the funeral, Smilla notices Dr. Andreas Tork, the CEO of Greenland Mining, offering money to Isaiah's mother, who rejects it angrily. Following her husband's accidental death in Greenland in mining, the company had offered her a pension. Detective Ravn from the District Attorney's office agrees to look into the case, but Smilla discovers he is involved with Tork. Smilla tracks down the company's former accountant, and gains access to a company report about activities in Greenland. A neighbor mechanic becomes involved and offers to help her.\n\nDetective Ravn threatens Smilla with jail for stealing Greenland Mining property. She agrees to suspend her investigation but, after learning from Isaiah's mother that her husband died from something in the mine's melt water, she continues. Smilla asks her father, Moritz Jaspersen, to help her in making sense of the Expedition Report; he agrees to look into it.\n\nAt the apartment complex, Smilla searches around Isaiah's former hiding place by a stairwell, and discovers a cassette tape hidden behind the wall. Unable to understand the audio, she takes the tape to a blind audio expert, Licht. Shortly after he tells her that it is Isaiah's father talking to his son, Licht is murdered. Smilla barely escapes with her life and the mechanic picks her up. They follow their pursuers to a ship, which Tork is preparing for another Greenland expedition.\n\nSmilla's father shows her medical x-rays from the report, which reveal that a type of lethal, prehistoric \"Arctic worm,\" long thought to be extinct, apparently was the cause of the \"accidental\" deaths of mine workers. When the worm entered individual's bodies and attacked organs, it caused toxic shock and death.\n\nAided by others, Smilla gets aboard the mining ship as an employee. She meets Nils Jakkelsen, who helps her discover videotapes that reveal the mining company had discovered an energy-producing meteorite. Tork believes this will give his company a dominant position in the industry. Smilla is chased throughout the ship by Tork's men, who kill Nils. Smilla is helped again by the mechanic, who tells her he has been working for the government to investigate the company.\n\nAs the ship approaches shore, Smilla leaves and makes her way across the frozen landscape. She finds the entrance to the Greenland Mining ice cave, where the company is conducting research on the meteorite. Prof. Loyen is among those present. An armed confrontation takes place, but Smilla is rescued by the mechanic and another man. Tork is wounded and runs out across the ice. Loyen falls into the icy pool (containing said meteorite) in the cave, instantly freezing to death (as he sinks below the depths). From outside, the mechanic/agent sets off a powerful bomb that destroys the cave and buries all still inside.\n\nThe resulting waves cause Tork to fall from the ice and drown in the freezing water. Smilla gazes over the landscape of ice and snow, the land of her childhood.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n*[[Julia Ormond]] as Smilla Jaspersen\n*[[Gabriel Byrne]] as The Mechanic\n*[[Richard Harris]] as Dr Andreas Tork\n*Clipper Miano as Isaiah Christiansen\n*Agga Olsen as Juliane Christiansen (Isaiah's mother)\n*[[Jim Broadbent]] as Dr Lagermann\n*[[Tom Wilkinson]] as Prof. Loyen\n*[[Robert Loggia]] as Moritz Jaspersen\n*[[Vanessa Redgrave]] as Elsa L\u00fcbing\n*Emma Croft as Benja\n*[[Bob Peck]] as Ravn\n*[[David Hayman]] as Telling\n*[[Peter Capaldi]] as Birgo Lander\n*[[Mario Adorf]] as Capt.

In her review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Janet Maslin]] wrote, \"''Smilla's Sense of Snow'' begins grippingly, then devolves into ever less credible derring-do as the action turns Smilla from a self-styled detective into an adventurer. The story finally leaves credibility behind as it sails off to the frozen north. The film has an elegant Smilla in Julia Ormond, whose remoteness works better here than it has in other roles. Ms. Ormond plays Smilla in the chic, alert, unsmiling fashion of a French film star, and she richly rewards the camera's many beautiful close-ups of Smilla cogitating on crime.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|authorlink=Janet Maslin|title=Smilla's Sense of Snow|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=28 February 1997|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/smilla-film-review.html|access-date=10 March 2021}}</ref>\n\nIn his review in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars. Despite the implausible ending, he found that the movie worked, writing, \"Here is a movie so absorbing, so atmospheric, so suspenseful and so dumb, that it proves my point: The subject matter doesn't matter in a movie nearly as much as mood, tone and style. ''Smilla's Sense of Snow'' is a superbly made film with one of the goofiest plots in many moons. Nothing in the final 30 minutes can possibly be taken seriously, and yet the movie works. Even the ending works, sort of, because the film has built up so much momentum.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|title=Smilla's Sense of Snow|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|date=14 March 1997|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/smillas-sense-of-snow-1997|access-date=10 March 2021}}</ref>\n\nIn her review in the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'', Carol Cling wrote, \"Fascinating setting and strong performances make up for the far-fetched plotting.\" In his review in the ''Flipside Movie Emporium'', Rob Vaux wrote, \"An underrated and effective thriller, buoyed by a fine performance from Julia Ormond.\" In his review in the ''[[Capital Times]]'' (Madison, WI), Rob Thomas wrote, \"An atmospheric and enjoyably preposterous mystery.\" And in her review in ''Movie Mom at [[Yahoo!
