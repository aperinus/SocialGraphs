The film follows the adventures of would-be self-help guru [[Stuart Smalley]], a creation of comedian [[Al Franken]], as he attempts to save both his deeply troubled family and his low-rated [[public-access television]] show. Some of the plot is inspired by Franken's book, ''I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like Me!: Daily Affirmations by Stuart Smalley''.\n\nThe film was produced by [[Lorne Michaels]]. Co-stars include [[Laura San Giacomo]], [[Vincent D'Onofrio]], [[Shirley Knight]], Lesley Boone and [[Harris Yulin]]. [[Julia Sweeney]], [[Joe Flaherty]], [[Robin Duke]], [[Richard Riehle]], future [[WWE]] ring announcer [[Justin Roberts]] and [[Kurt Fuller]] have cameo roles.\n\n==Plot==\nStuart Smalley ([[Al Franken]]), the disciple of the [[12-step program]], is challenged by life's injustices. He loses his public-access cable television show, must beg his manipulative overbearing boss for his job back, rehabilitate his alcoholic father and drug abusing brother ([[Vincent D'Onofrio]]), and support his overweight mother ([[Shirley Knight]]) and sister (Lesley Boone) in their lack of ability in handling their relationships with their husbands. Stuart is supported by his 12-step sponsors as he regresses to his negative behaviors each time he faces these challenges.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Al Franken]] as Stuart Smalley\n* [[Laura San Giacomo]] as Julia\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as Donnie Smalley\n* [[Shirley Knight]] as Mrs. Smalley\n* [[Lesley Boone]] as Jodie Smalley\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as Dad\n* [[Julia Sweeney]] as Mea C.\n* [[Joe Flaherty]] as Cousin Ray\n\n==Production==\nAl Franken created and played the character Stuart Smalley in ''Saturday Night Live'' sketches; in 1992 Franken wrote a book, in character as Stuart, titled ''I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like Me!: Daily Affirmations by Stuart Smalley''.<ref name=Franken1992/> After reading the book, Harold Ramis approached Franken about developing it into a movie. According to Franken, Ramis was largely responsible for making the movie happen.<ref name=\"VanityFair\" />\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was a failure at the box office, earning only $912,082.<ref name=bomojo/> This followed the box-office failures of other SNL-adaptations. Shortly after the movie left the theaters, ''Saturday Night Live'' featured a \"Daily Affirmations with Stuart Smalley\" sketch that parodied the poor box office returns.<ref name=SNL/> Stuart was depressed and bitter throughout the entire segment and lambasted the audience for choosing other movies (such as ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'' and ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'') over his.\n\nIn a 1999 appearance on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', Franken stated that he was \"very proud\" of the movie.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} However, in his 2003 book ''[[Oh, the Things I Know! A Guide to Success, or Failing That, Happiness|<nowiki/>'Oh, the Things I Know! A Guide to Success, or Failing That, Happiness]],'' Franken mentioned his [[depression (mood)|depression]] following the film's failure. {{citation needed|reason=full citn with pg# is needed|date=September 2015}} \n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 30% based on reviews from 27 critics, with an average rating of 4.7/10 .<ref name=\"RT\"/> On [[Metacritic]] it has a weighted average score of 54% based on reviews from 16 critics.<ref name=\"MC\" /> It received a nomination for Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy at the [[1995 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards]], which it lost to ''[[Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thestinkers.com/1995.html |title=The Stinkers 1995 Ballot |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000711153615/http://thestinkers.com/1995.html |work=[[Stinkers Bad Movie Awards]] |archive-date=11 July 2000 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Siskel & Ebert]] each gave the film a \"[[thumbs signal|thumbs up]]\" rating, with Siskel calling it \"smart and hip\" and Ebert saying that \"it has more courage than a lot of serious films.\"<ref name=\"SiskelEbert\"/>\n\n==Home media==\n''Stuart Saves His Family'' was released on [[VHS]] in October 1995; it was released on DVD on April 17, 2001.<ref name=\"RT\" /> In 2007, the film was packaged with two other Lorne Michaels productions, ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' and ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'', to be sold as a \"triple feature\".<ref name=Amazon/> In 2013, [[Warner Bros.]] acquired the management of Paramount's DVD library, and added ''Stuart Saves His Family'' to their Warner Archive Collection.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"bomojo\">{{cite web |title=Stuart Saves His Family |website=Box Office Mojo |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=stuartsaveshisfamily.htm |access-date=2015-09-09}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Franken1992\">{{cite book |last=Franken |first=Al |title=I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like Me!: Daily Affirmations by Stuart Smalley |year=1992 |publisher=Dell |isbn=978-0-440-50470-2 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/imgoodenoughimsm00alfr }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"VanityFair\">{{cite journal |title=20 Years Later, the Famous ''S.N.L.''
