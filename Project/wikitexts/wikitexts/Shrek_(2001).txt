It is the first installment in the [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' franchise]]. Directed by [[Andrew Adamson]] and [[Vicky Jenson]] in their [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debuts]] from a screenplay written by [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]], [[Terry Rossio]], [[Joe Stillman]], and [[Roger S. H. Schulman]], the film stars [[Mike Myers]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Cameron Diaz]], and [[John Lithgow]]. In the film, the ogre [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] (Myers) finds his swamp overrun by fairy tale creatures banished by [[Lord Farquaad]] (Lithgow). With the help of [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]] (Murphy), Shrek agrees to rescue [[Princess Fiona]] (Diaz) for Farquaad to regain his swamp.\n\nAfter purchasing rights to Steig's book in 1991, [[Steven Spielberg]] sought to produce a [[traditionally-animated]] film adaptation, but [[John H. Williams (film producer)|John H. Williams]] convinced him to bring the project to the newly founded [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] in 1994. [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], along with Williams and [[Aron Warner]], began development on ''Shrek'' in 1995, immediately following the studio's purchase of the rights from Spielberg. [[Chris Farley]] was cast as the voice for the title character, recording most of the required dialogue, but died in 1997 before his work on the film was finished; Myers was hired to replace him, and gave Shrek his iconic [[Scottish accent]]. The film was initially intended to be created using [[motion capture]], but after poor test results, the studio hired [[Pacific Data Images]] to complete the final computer animation.

It was widely praised by critics for its animation, voice performances, soundtrack, writing and humor, which they noted catered to both adults and children. ''Shrek'' was nominated for the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and won for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]]. It earned six nominations at the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] (BAFTA), winning for [[BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].\n\nThe film's success helped establish [[DreamWorks Animation]] as a competitor to [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] and [[Pixar]] in feature film computer animation. Three sequels have been released\u2014''[[Shrek 2]]'' (2004), ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' (2007), and ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'' (2010)\u2014along with a [[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|spin-off film]] and other productions in the ''Shrek'' franchise. It is also regarded as one of the most influential animated films of the 2000s. The United States [[Library of Congress]] selected ''Shrek'' for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 2020. Plans for a fifth film were cancelled and then revived in 2016, although it has since stalled and has yet to begin production.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP: FILMPLOT, plot summaries must be between 400 and 700 words. Current word count is 682 -->\n[[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] is an anti-social and highly-territorial green [[ogre]] who loves the solitude of his [[swamp]]. His life is interrupted after the dwarfish [[Lord Farquaad]] of Duloc  exiles a vast number of fairy-tale creatures who subsequently relocate to Shrek's swamp. Angered by the intrusion, Shrek decides to visit Farquaad and demand they be moved elsewhere. He reluctantly allows the talkative [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]], who was exiled as well, to tag along and guide him to Duloc.\n\nMeanwhile, Farquaad is presented with the [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]], which tells him that in order to become a king, he must marry a princess. Farquaad chooses [[Princess Fiona]], who is imprisoned in a tower guarded by a dragon. Unwilling to perform the task himself, he organizes a tournament in which the winner will receive the \"privilege\" of rescuing Fiona. Meanwhile, Shrek and Donkey arrive at Duloc during the tournament. Disgusted by Shrek, Farquaad proclaims whoever kills the ogre as the winner; however, Shrek and Donkey defeat Farquaad's knights with relative ease. An amused Farquaad proclaims them champions and demands that they rescue Fiona. Shrek negotiates to have the fairy-tale creatures relocated if he succeeds, and Farquaad accepts.\n\nShrek and Donkey travel to the castle and are attacked by the [[List of Shrek characters#Dragon|Dragon]]. Shrek locates Fiona, who is appalled by his lack of [[romanticism]]; they flee the castle after rescuing Donkey. When Shrek removes his helmet revealing he is an ogre, Fiona stubbornly refuses to go to Duloc, demanding Farquaad arrive in person to save her. Shrek carries her against her will. \n\nThat night, after setting up camp and with Fiona alone in a cave, Shrek confides in Donkey about his frustration with being feared and rejected by others over his appearance. Fiona overhears and decides to be kind to Shrek. The next day, they encounter [[Robin Hood]] and his band of Merry Men. Fiona dispatches them easily with martial arts when they harass the group. Shrek becomes impressed with Fiona, and they begin to fall in love.\n\nWhen the trio nears Duloc, Fiona takes shelter in a [[windmill]] for the evening. Donkey later enters alone and discovers that Fiona has transformed into an ogress. She explains she has been cursed since childhood, forced to transform into an ogress every night, and changing back at sunrise. She tells Donkey that only \"[[Romance (love)|true love]]'s kiss\" will break the spell and change her to \"love's true form\". Meanwhile, Shrek is about to confess his feelings to Fiona, when he overhears Fiona referring to herself as an \"ugly beast\". Believing that Fiona is talking about him, Shrek angrily leaves and returns the next morning with Farquaad. Confused and hurt by Shrek's abrupt hostility, Fiona accepts Farquaad's marriage proposal and requests they be married before nightfall.\n\nShrek abandons Donkey and returns to his now-vacated swamp, but he realizes that despite his privacy, he feels miserable and misses Fiona. Donkey arrives at the swamp and confronts Shrek. During their quarrel, Donkey explains that the \"ugly beast\" Fiona was referring to was someone else, and urges him to express his feelings for Fiona before she marries. The two reconcile and quickly travel to Duloc by riding Dragon, who Donkey has befriended. Shrek interrupts the wedding just before the ceremony completes and tells Fiona that Farquaad is only marrying her to become king. The sun sets as Fiona transforms into an ogress in front of everyone, causing a surprised Shrek to understand what he overheard.\n\nOutraged and disgusted, Farquaad orders Shrek executed and Fiona detained. Dragon, alongside Donkey, bursts in and devours Farquaad. Shrek and Fiona profess their love and share a kiss. Fiona's curse is broken, though this permanently makes her an ogress against her expectations; Shrek reassures her that he still finds her beautiful. They marry in the swamp with fairy-tale creatures in attendance, then leave for their [[honeymoon]].\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of Shrek characters}}\n* [[Mike Myers]] as:\n**[[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]<ref>{{cite news |author=Stars and Stories |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3665827/Mike-Myers-how-I-nailed-Shreks-accent.html |title=Mike Myers: how I nailed Shrek's accent |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=June 15, 2007 |access-date=January 21, 2014 |location=London |archive-date=March 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312131414/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3665827/Mike-Myers-how-I-nailed-Shreks-accent.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n**One of the [[Three Blind Mice (Shrek)|Three Blind Mice]]<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/tellmemore/2010/05/21/127034341/hollywood-s-million-dollar-donkey |title=Eddie Murphy: Hollywood's Million-Dollar Donkey : Tell Me More |newspaper=NPR |date=May 21, 2010 |access-date=January 21, 2014 |archive-date=February 1, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201211029/http://www.npr.org/blogs/tellmemore/2010/05/21/127034341/hollywood-s-million-dollar-donkey |url-status=live |last1=Izrael |first1=Jimi }}</ref>\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as [[Princess Fiona]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/movies/16shrek.html |title=Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz on 'Shrek' |work=The New York Times |date=May 10, 2010 |access-date=January 11, 2014 |first=Dave |last=Itzkoff |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100518103812/https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/movies/16shrek.html |archive-date=May 18, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[John Lithgow]] as [[Lord Farquaad]]<ref>{{cite web |author=Peter Bradshaw |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/jun/29/1 |title=Shrek &#124; Film |website=The Guardian |date=June 29, 2001 |access-date=January 21, 2014 |archive-date=February 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203154741/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/jun/29/1 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Vincent Cassel]] as [[List of Shrek characters#Monsieur Robin Hood|\"Monsieur\" Robin Hood]]<ref>{{cite news |author=Paul Willis For CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/08/12/cassel.profile/index.html?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |title=Vincent Cassel: Playing France's tough guys |work=CNN|date=August 24, 2009 |access-date=January 21, 2014 |archive-date=February 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203081440/http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/08/12/cassel.profile/index.html?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as [[Gingerbread Man (Shrek)|Gingerbread Man]]<ref>{{cite web |last=Brian |first=Greg |url=https://news.yahoo.com/conrad-vernon-today-funniest-unknown-voice-actor-shrek-203200437.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219003147/https://news.yahoo.com/conrad-vernon-today-funniest-unknown-voice-actor-shrek-203200437.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 19, 2014 |title=Conrad Vernon: Today's funniest unknown voice actor, from 'Shrek' to 'Madagascar 3' \u2013 Yahoo News |publisher=Yahoo!

This fell into the hands of the surfacing animators, who used flow controls within a complex shader to provide the fur with many attributes (ability to change directions, lie flat, swirl, etc.).<ref name = \"dmfanimatingshrek\"/> It was then the job of the visual effects group, led by Ken Bielenberg, to make the fur react to environment conditions. Once the technology was mastered, it could be applied to many aspects of the movie, including grass, moss, beards, eyebrows, and even threads on Shrek's tunic. Making human hair realistic was different from Donkey's fur, requiring a separate rendering system and much attention from the [[lighting]] and [[visual effects]] teams.<ref name = \"dmfanimatingshrek\"/>\n\n''Shrek'' has 31 sequences, with 1,288 total shots.<ref name = \"Production Information on Culture.com\"/> Aron Warner said that the creators \"envisioned a magical environment that you could immerse yourself into\".
