It won the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]], a [[Academy Honorary Award|Special Award]] as [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] in the United States, and a [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film from any Source]] at the [[British Academy Film Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIt is June 1940, during the [[Battle of France]].<ref name=\"CritCol\"/>  After five-year-old Paulette's parents and pet dog die in a German air attack on a column of refugees fleeing [[Paris]], the traumatized child meets 10-year-old Michel Doll\u00e9 whose peasant family takes her in.<ref name=\"CritCol\"/> She quickly becomes attached to Michel. The two attempt to cope with the death and destruction that surrounds them by secretly building a small cemetery among the ruins of an abandoned watermill,<ref name=\"CritCol\"/> where they bury her dog and start to bury other animals, marking their graves with crosses stolen from a local graveyard, including one belonging to Michel's brother. Michel's father first suspects that Michel's brother's cross was stolen from the graveyard by his neighbour. Eventually, the father finds out that Michel has stolen the cross.\n\nMeanwhile, the French [[National Gendarmerie|gendarmes]] come to the Doll\u00e9 household in order to take Paulette. Michel cannot bear the thought of her leaving and tells his father that he would tell him where the stolen crosses are, but in return he should not give Paulette to the gendarmes. His father doesn't keep his promise: Michel destroys the crosses and Paulette ends up going to a [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] camp, but at the end of the film is seen running away into a crowd of people in the Red Cross camp, crying for Michel and then for her mother.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Georges Poujouly]] as Michel Doll\u00e9\n* [[Brigitte Fossey]] as Paulette\n* [[Philippe de Ch\u00e9risey|Am\u00e9d\u00e9e]] as Francis Gouard\n* [[Laurence Badie]] as Berthe Doll\u00e9\n* Suzanne Courtal as Madame Doll\u00e9\n* Lucien Hubert as Doll\u00e9\n* [[Jacques Marin]] as Georges Doll\u00e9\n* Pierre Merov\u00e9e as Raymond Doll\u00e9\n* Louis Saint\u00e8ve as the Priest\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was widely praised among critics, whose \"howling protests\" were heard at the [[1952 Cannes Film Festival]] where it was not an \"official entry of France\";<ref name=\"nyt52\"/> instead, it was \"screened on the fringe of the Competition.\"<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/article/57998.html | title= France at Cannes| date= 8 March 2011| author= Herpe, No\u00ebl| author-link= :fr:No\u00ebl Herpe|access-date= 2012-10-07| publisher= Cannes Film Festival| quote= Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment won awards in 1946 for ''[[La Bataille du rail|La Bataille du Rail]]'', in 1949 for ''[[The Walls of Malapaga|Au-Del\u00e0 des Grilles]]'' and in 1954 for ''[[Knave of Hearts (film)|Monsieur Ripois]]'' (but oddly, not for ''Jeux Interdits'', which was screened on the fringe of the Competition, but went on to make the entire world weep); {{lang-fr|1= Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment se voyait r\u00e9compenser en 1946 pour ''La Bataille du rail'', en 1949 pour ''Au del\u00e0 des grilles'', en 1954 pour ''Monsieur Ripois'' (mais curieusement pas pour ''Jeux interdits'', projet\u00e9 en marge de la comp\u00e9tition avant de faire pleurer le monde entier...)|italic=unset}}<!-- N.B. the date and the original French quote are from the PDF version whose URL http://www.festival-cannes.com/assets/File/Filmographie%20Pays/Cin%C3%A9ma%20fran%C3%A7ais_HERPE.pdf  is supplied at the end of the cited URL. if trans_quote and trans_url were supported, I would have used them-->}}</ref>\n\nThe film was entered into competition at the [[13th Venice International Film Festival]]; festival organizers at first considered the film ineligible because it had been screened at Cannes;<ref name=\"nyt52\"/>  it ended up receiving the [[Golden Lion]], the Festival's highest prize.\n\nUpon its release, it was lambasted by some, who said it was a \"vicious and unfair picture of the [[peasant]]ry of France\";<ref name=\"nyt52\"/> in France, 4,910,835 theater tickets were sold,<ref name=\"JPBox Office\"/> making the most successful film at the French box office in 1952.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Benson |first1=Ed |title=The Screen of History in Cl\u00e9ment's Forbidden Games.|journal=Literature/Film Quarterly |date=2005 |volume=33 |issue=3 |page=207}}</ref> Following its December 1952 release in the United States, [[Bosley Crowther]] called it a film with \"the irony of a ''[[Grand Illusion (film)|Grand Illusion]]'', the authenticity of a ''[[Random Harvest|Harvest]]'' and the finesse of French films at their best\";  according to Crowther, the film is a \"brilliant and devastating drama of the tragic frailties of men, clear and uncorrupted by sentimentality or dogmatism in its candid view of life.\"<ref name=\"nyt52\"/>\n \nAt the [[25th Academy Awards]], ''Forbidden Games'' won an out-of-competition [[Academy Honorary Award|Special Award]] as [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]].<ref name=\"CritCol\"/>\nIn December 1952, at the [[National Board of Review Awards 1952|24th National Board of Review Awards]] it was chosen as one of that year's five top foreign films.
