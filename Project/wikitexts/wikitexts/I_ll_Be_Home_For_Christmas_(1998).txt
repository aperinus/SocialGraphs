The plot follows a college student who must make it from his campus in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] to his family's home in [[Larchmont, New York]] in time for Christmas dinner in order to win his father's [[Porsche 356|Porsche]]. It stars [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]], [[Jessica Biel]], [[Adam LaVorgna]], [[Sean O'Bryan]] and [[Gary Cole]] and was released on November 13, 1998.\n\n==Plot==\n[[California]] boarding school student and New York teen Jake Wilkinson has not been home to [[Larchmont, New York]] for any holidays following his biological mother's death and his father's remarriage 10 months later. A few days before [[Christmas Eve]], his father offers to give him his vintage 1957 [[Porsche 356]] if he arrives to their home by 6:00 PM on Christmas Eve for Christmas dinner. Initially, Jake had traded in his airline ticket to [[New York City]] for two tickets to [[Cabo San Lucas]] to take his girlfriend, beautiful Allie Henderson, who is also from New York. When she declines, Jake reconsiders his father's deal and retrades the tickets back to New York. Allie agrees to ride with him.\n\nWith his trio of goons, fellow student and notorious school bully Eddie Taffet, Jake's nemesis and rival for Allie's affections, leaves Jake in the desert dressed as [[Santa Claus]] as revenge for not getting an exam cheat sheet (a deal they had that Eddie secretly sabotaged on purpose). While Jake is stuck in the California desert, Eddie ends up giving a reluctant Allie a ride to New York after she thinks Jake bailed on her again.\n\nJake has only three days to get to Larchmont if he wants the car. He stumbles upon Nolan, a simple-minded thief who is driving stolen kitchen goods to his dealer near New York. A police officer named Max pulls them over in [[Red Cliff, Colorado]] for speeding, so Jake lies that Nolan is his elf, Snowpuff, and they're donating the goods to the children's hospital. The officer invites them to accompany him to [[North Platte, Nebraska]] to help him win back his wife Marjorie.\n\nMeanwhile, Allie convinces Eddie to stay the night at a novelty hotel in a [[Bavaria]]n village, the Edelbruck in [[Amana, Iowa]]. They are unknowingly standing beneath mistletoe when a news anchor is reporting live. Jake sees them kiss while he's waiting at the bus station in [[Nebraska]] and develops a scheme to convince the bus driver to drop him off at the Bavarian village. He obtains a cooler and a slab of meat, writes Allie's name and address on the cooler, and convinces the whole busload that the cooler needs to be delivered to a little girl at the hospital in the Bavarian village for a transplant.\n\nAfter Allie lets Jake into her and Eddie's room, Eddie walks out of the shower only clad in a towel and Jake assumes he and Allie have slept together. Jake and Allie make up until Jake blurts out that Eddie prevented him from getting home by 6 PM. Upset that Jake cares more about the car than about her, Allie storms onto the bus and takes Jake's seat.\n\nJake and Eddie drive off. Eddie suddenly becomes jealous realizing that Jake will get Allie ''and'' the Porsche if he makes it home, and throws Jake out of his car somewhere in [[Wisconsin]]. Jake decides to enter a [[Santa Claus]] race for a chance to win the $1,000 prize to buy an airline ticket to New York. Eddie is arrested after insulting (and possibly doing more to) two police officers dressed as [[Christmas tree]]s patrolling the race. While registering for the race, Jake meets a nice man named Jeff Wilson, whom he barely beats in the race. But en route to the airport, the taxi driver informs Jake that Jeff is actually the mayor of the town; he usually wins the race every year and uses the prize money to buy food for the impoverished. Jake feels bad and gives the money to the Mayor.\n\nJake talks to his sister, who arranges for an airline ticket for him from [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. A staff for his intended airline doesn't allow Jake board because he has no photographic identification, so he stows away in a dog kennel on a cargo aircraft with a large dog named Ringo. From the airport he hides on a train, tries to hitch a ride in a car, then steals a one-horse open sleigh from the local parade. When he reaches his street, he apologizes to Allie and they make up. Jake rides the sleigh home, arrives at 5:59 PM, and intentionally waits until 6:00 PM to go inside so he isn't in time to get the Porsche. When his father offers it to him anyway, he refuses. He also finally accepts his stepmother. The Wilkinsons and Allie get into the sleigh just as the parade arrives and join the procession.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]] as Jake Wilkinson\n* [[Jessica Biel]] as Allie Henderson\n* [[Adam LaVorgna]] as Eddie Taffet\n* [[Sean O'Bryan]] as Officer Max\n* [[Gary Cole]] as Mr. Wilkinson\n* [[Eve Gordon]] as Carolyn Wilkinson\n* [[Lauren Maltby]] as Tracey Wilkinson\n* [[Andrew Lauer]] as Nolan\n* [[Lesley Boone]] as Marjorie\n\n== Release ==\n=== Box office ===\n''I'll Be Home for Christmas'' made $3.9 million in its opening weekend, finishing at 6th at the box office.
