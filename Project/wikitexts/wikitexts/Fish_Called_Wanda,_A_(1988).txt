They bring in two Americans: [[con artist]] Wanda Gershwitz and weapons expert Otto West, an ignorant and mean-spirited [[Anglophobia|anglophobe]]. Wanda and Otto are lovers, but pretend to be siblings, so Wanda can work her charms on Ken and George. The heist succeeds and the gang escapes with a large sum in [[diamond]]s, which they hide. Wanda and Otto then betray George to the police and he is arrested. They return to collect the loot, with Wanda planning to double-cross Otto as well, but it is gone: George has also returned, and moved it to a [[safe deposit box]], giving Ken the key. Wanda finds it in Ken's fish tank and hides it in her locket.\n\nWanda decides to seduce George's barrister, Archie Leach, in hopes of learning where the diamonds are. Archie is in a loveless marriage and quickly falls for Wanda, but Otto's jealous interference causes their liaisons to go disastrously wrong. Wanda accidentally leaves her locket at Archie's house; his wife, Wendy, delightedly assumes that the ''W'' on it means it is a gift for her.\n\nInventing a reason, Wanda demands that Archie retrieve the locket, but Wendy will not give it up. He finally fakes a robbery at his own home in order to explain its disappearance. Just then, Otto arrives there to apologise to Archie for earlier insults, and decides to help Archie by knocking the burglar unconscious. Archie does get the locket and returns it to Wanda at their next tryst, but they are interrupted. He subsequently telephones her to call off their affair as he now realizes she only wants a rich man. Otto arrives at Archie's house again to apologise, but Wendy overhears their conversation and learns about Archie and Wanda.\n\nGeorge asks Ken to kill [[the Crown]]'s only eyewitness to the robbery, the elderly Eileen Coady, who owns three small dogs. Ken repeatedly tries to kill her, but each time accidentally kills one of the dogs instead, causing him great distress. But he succeeds when the last dog's death gives her a fatal heart attack. With no witness, George seems poised to be released. He gives instructions to Ken, revealing the location of the diamonds. When Otto learns that Ken knows this, he tortures Ken into revealing it by eating Ken's various pet fish, leaving Ken's favourite, named Wanda, until last. Ken reveals that the diamonds are at the Cathcart Towers Hotel near [[Heathrow Airport]], but does not know that Wanda has the key.\n\nWith Otto's knowledge and Wanda's key, the two want George to remain in prison. At his trial, Wanda, as a defense witness, unexpectedly gives evidence incriminating him. Archie is stunned by her statements and flubs his [[direct examination|questioning]], <!-- NOT cross-examination, as she's a defense witness --> inadvertently calling her \"darling\". Wendy, watching from the public gallery, declares their marriage over.\n\nWith his career and marriage ruined, Archie resolves to cut his losses, steal the loot himself and flee to [[South America]] with Wanda. Promising less prison time, Archie asks George about the diamonds and learns of Otto and Wanda's complicity and that Ken knows their location. Archie sees Wanda fleeing the court and they race to Ken's flat together. As they arrive, Otto steals Archie's car, taking Wanda with him. While Ken stutters uncontrollably, Archie painstakingly gets him to reveal the location of the safe deposit box. They then set out for Heathrow on Ken's moped.\n\nOtto and Wanda recover the diamonds, but Wanda double-crosses Otto and leaves him unconscious in a broom cupboard at Heathrow. She reluctantly boards her flight to [[Rio de Janeiro]] without Archie. Otto recovers, steals a boarding pass, and makes his way to the tarmac, where he is confronted by Archie. Otto is about to kill Archie, but Archie stalls him by taunting Otto about America's defeat in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. Ken arrives, driving a [[steamroller]], seeking vengeance for his fish. Otto finds he has stepped in wet [[concrete]] and cannot move; he is run over, but survives. Archie and Wanda board the plane while Otto, clinging to the window outside, curses them until he is blown off during takeoff.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[John Cleese]] as Archie Leach\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as Wanda Gershwitz\n* [[Kevin Kline]] as Otto West\n* [[Michael Palin]] as Ken Pile\n* [[Maria Aitken]] as Wendy Leach\n* [[Tom Georgeson]] as George Thomason\n* [[Patricia Hayes]] as Mrs Eileen Coady\n* [[Geoffrey Palmer (actor)|Geoffrey Palmer]] as Judge\n* [[John Cleese#Personal life|Cynthia Cleese]] as Portia Leach\n* [[Ken Campbell]] as Bartlett\n* [[Al Hunter Ashton|Al Ashton]] as Warder\n* [[Roger Brierley]] as Davidson\n* [[Llewellyn Rees]] as Sir John\n* Michael Percival as Percival\n* [[Jeremy Child]] as Mr. Johnson\n* [[Stephen Fry]] as Hutchison (Cameo)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nCleese and Crichton had attempted to make a film together in 1969.<ref name=losangeles>{{cite news |last=Oliver |first=Myrna |title=Charles Crichton; British Director of Movie Comedies |date=16 September 1999 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1999/sep/16/news/mn-10742 |access-date=29 December 2015}}</ref> Although the project never entered development, they promised each other that they would eventually collaborate on a film.<ref name=newspaper>{{cite news |last=Harmetz |first=Aljean |title='Fish Called Wanda' a Crichton keeper |date=26 March 1989 |newspaper=[[The Milwaukee Journal]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19890326&id=RWsaAAAAIBAJ&pg=4378,1028019 |access-date=29 December 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=March 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In June 1983, the two began writing the script for ''Wanda'', and, for the next two and half years, they met three times a month to work on the script.<ref name=newspaper/> According to Crichton, \"We had a week of rehearsals and then a gap of two weeks in which to incorporate any new ideas which had been thrown up and to polish the script.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Vallance |first=Tom |title=Obituary: Charles Crichton |date=15 September 1999 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-charles-crichton-1119361.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124205438/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-charles-crichton-1119361.html |archive-date=2015-11-24 |url-access=limited |url-status=live |access-date=29 December 2015}}</ref> According to Michael Palin, the original title was \"A Goldfish Called Wanda.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Halfway to Hollywood: Diaries 1980-1988 |last=Palin |first=Michael |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-312-68202-6 |page=412 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312682026/page/412}}</ref>\n\nCleese told an interviewer that he called his character Archie Leach, the late actor [[Cary Grant]]'s real name, because \"I feel this film is as near as I'll ever get to being Cary Grant.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://people.com/archive/his-love-life-may-be-fawlty-but-john-cleese-is-reeling-in-cash-and-kudos-with-a-fish-called-wanda-vol-30-no-7/ |last=Alexander |first=Michael |date=August 15, 1988 |title=His Love Life May Be Fawlty, but John Cleese Is Reeling in Cash and Kudos with a Fish Called Wanda |magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]] |access-date=July 12, 2018}}</ref> While in character as Archie Leach, Cleese recited a longer passage from [[Mikhail Lermontov]]'s poem ''\u041c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430'' (\"Prayer\").\n\nCleese, admitting in press interviews that he had no knowledge of how to direct a film, served as co-director, since the studio executives at MGM were worried about Crichton's age\u2014he was 78 years old at the time.<ref name=losangeles/><ref name=newspaper/><ref name=guardian>{{cite web |last=Bergan |first=Ronald |title=Charles Crichton |date=14 September 1999 |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/sep/15/guardianobituaries3 |access-date=29 December 2015}}</ref> On the set, Crichton wore a T-shirt presented to him by Cleese and inscribed \"Age and treachery will always overcome youth and skill\".<ref name=guardian/>\n\nFilming began in England on July 13, 1987, and wrapped on September 21, 1987, after 70 days.<ref name=newspaper/>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a 96% approval rating, based on 67 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10.
