Jeannie's father works with his loathsome son-in-law Chip (the husband of Jeannie's older sister Gaylord) to find a way to discredit Booger and cause Jeannie to call off the wedding. Lewis Skolnick and the other nerds discover the conspiracy and work to save Booger's wedding ceremony from being ruined. In a subplot, Lewis' wife Betty is pregnant with their first child and is in her third trimester as the wedding date approaches.\n\nBooger fights an accusation that he fathered an [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] child, Heidi, who is introduced as \"Heidi Dawson\" by Chip. Jeannie's mother tells her husband that she will leave him if he does not support his daughter's wedding to Booger, and Chip's accusations fall apart when the little girl reveals she was taken from an orphanage to play the illegitimate child role. Chip's wife decides to divorce him and throw him out of their lives forever, leaving Chip to swear his own revenge against the nerds (while Gaylord declares to cheers that her next husband will be a nerd). Aaron apologizes to Booger and gives his daughter his blessing, stating as well that he is proud to be nouveau riche and the California GOP will have to accept him that way or else. Booger and Jeannie are married, Betty gives birth to a healthy baby boy, and the newly married couple tell Heidi they would like to adopt her.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Curtis Armstrong]] as Dudley (Booger) Dawson\n*[[Corinne Bohrer]] as Jeanie Humphrey-Dawson\n*[[Joseph Bologna]] as Aaron Humphrey\n*[[Robert Carradine]] as Lewis Skolnick\n*[[Julia Montgomery]] as Betty Childs-Skolnick\n*[[Christina Pickles]] as Tippy\n*[[Jessica Tuck]] as Gaylord Medford\n*[[Robert Picardo]] as Chad Penrod\n*[[Stephen Davies (actor)|Stephen Davies]] as Chip Medford\n*[[Larry B.

Several other network shows employed similar gimmicks with aromatic cards and 3D glasses at around the same time, including ''[[Living Single]]'' and ''[[Married... with Children]]''. The 3D effects used in these broadcasts was based on the [[Pulfrich effect]].\n\n==Reception==\nTodd Everett of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' had a subdued reaction to the film. He said it was \"capably directed\" and that the 3-D and \"aroma-vision\" effects were \"OK\", and praised several of the actors' performances, but criticized the script as being typical made-for-TV filler, and said that overall the Nerd series was wearing thin.<ref name=Varrev/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Amg movie|154252}}\n* {{IMDb title|0110982}}\n\n{{Revenge of the Nerds}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Revenge Of The Nerds IV: Nerds In Love}}\n[[Category:1994 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1994 films]]\n[[Category:1994 television films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox Television films]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about fraternities and sororities]]\n[[Category:Films about weddings]]\n[[Category:Fox network original films]]\n[[Category:Revenge of the Nerds|Revenge Of The Nerds 4]]\n[[Category:Television sequel films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
