The film was theatrically released in 1975 by Group 1 Films, and enjoyed a considerable run to become one of the 50 top-grossing films of that year.\n\nAfter a three-time [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network run, ''The Giant Spider Invasion'' achieved further exposure many years later, when it was featured in a 1997 episode of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.

Vance and Langer becoming romantically involved. The townspeople eventually panic when confronted with the spider.\n\nThe invasion is deduced to be the result of some sort of interdimensional gateway, and is ultimately thwarted when Drs. Vance and Langer manage to close off the gateway, draining the spiders of their energy and causing them to melt into puddles of sludge.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Steve Brodie (actor)|Steve Brodie]] as Dr. J.R.
