Schmitt|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 19, 1997|access-date=September 4, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOutside a church celebrating an [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[baptism]] in [[Pale, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Pale]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], the Bosnian Finance Minister, a moderate pushing for peace in the ongoing [[Yugoslav Wars]], is murdered.\n\nAt a missile base in [[Kartaly]] ([[Chelyabinsk Oblast]]), [[Russia]], ten R-36M2 Mod. 5, 550\u2013750 kiloton MIRV  nuclear warheads that belong to a [[SS-18 Satan]] ICBM are loaded onto a train for transport to a [[START II|dismantling facility]]. However, [[Armed Forces of Russia|Russian Army]] General Aleksandr Kodoroff, along with a rogue [[Spetznaz]] unit, kills the soldiers on board the transport train and transfers nine of the warheads to another train. Kodoroff then activates the timer on the remaining warhead and sends the transport on a collision course with a passenger train. Minutes later, the 500-kiloton warhead detonates, killing thousands of civilians and delaying an investigation of the accident.\n\nThe detonation immediately attracts the attention of the US government. Dr. Julia Kelly, head of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] Nuclear Smuggling Group, believes that [[Armed Forces of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Chechen terrorists]] are behind the incident. [[2nd Ranger Battalion|US Army Ranger]] Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Devoe interrupts her briefing to suggest that the incident was staged to hide the hijacking of the warheads. A call to Devoe's friend and Russian counterpart, [[Federal Security Service|FSB]] Colonel Dimitri Vertikoff, adds reliability to his theory and he is assigned as Kelly's military liaison.\n\nKelly and Devoe secure information about the terrorist's hijacking operation through an Austrian trucking company that works as a front for the [[Russian Mafia]]. They meet Vertikoff in Vienna, then they assume identities to visit Shummaker, who organizes the Russian's trucking. After torturing Shummaker for information, the trio are chased through Vienna by his men, who kill Vertikoff before Devoe finishes killing the attackers.\n\nInformation from the trucking company says that the nukes are going to [[Iran]] via a route through [[Azerbaijan]]. When US spy satellites place the truck in a traffic jam of refugees in [[Dagestan]], Devoe uses a ruse to identify it. This information is passed on to Russian authorities in hopes of stopping the transfer to Iran. The Russian military stops Kodoroff at a roadblock, but he and his men kill the soldiers.\n\nDevoe leads an airborne [[United States Special Operations Command|Special Operations]] team from a U.S. base in [[Turkey]] to stop them. Denied entry into Russian airspace, one of the three Special Ops helicopters is shot down by a Russian [[surface-to-air missile]], but the remaining two manage to locate Kodoroff's truck. They fire missiles which disable Kodoroff's truck, then engage in a gunfight, killing Kodoroff and securing the warheads. Interrogation of the surviving member of the group, a U.S. educated Pakistani nuclear scientist, reveals that one warhead had been sent off with an operative before the truck was intercepted.\n\nThe information from the trucking company leads [[Implementation Force|IFOR]] to a [[Sarajevo]] address. Inside is a video cassette of a Bosnian named Du\u0161an Gavri\u0107, who disclaims allegiance to any particular faction in the Yugoslav Wars, but blames other countries for supplying weapons to all sides in the war. Kelly's further analysis of the trucking company documents suggests that Gavri\u0107 intends to bomb a meeting at the [[UN headquarters]] in New York City. Gavri\u0107 arrives in Manhattan with the Bosnian diplomatic delegation.\n\nA flashback shows that Gavri\u0107 wants to avenge the death of his wife and daughter, who were killed in Sarajevo during a sniper attack. He and his brother are later found by Devoe and Kelly. When his brother is killed by Devoe, a wounded and enraged Gavri\u0107 flees into a parochial school where he's seen in the church sanctuary. Devoe and Kelly confront Gavri\u0107, who commits suicide, knowing that the bomb is set to go off in a matter of minutes. With only seconds to spare, Dr. Kelly is able to remove part of the [[explosive lens]] shell of the bomb and to stop the primary explosion from establishing [[critical mass]] within the [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|plutonium core]]. The primary explosives detonate, wrecking the church, as Devoe and Kelly dive out of a window. Kelly's manipulation of the warhead prevent it from detonating as a nuclear explosion.\n\nAfter the nuclear incident is over, Kelly is seen swimming laps in a pool. Devoe stops by and asks her out for a drink, which she accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[George Clooney]] as [[2nd Ranger Battalion|US Army Ranger]] Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Devoe\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Dr. Julia Kelly\n* [[Marcel Iure\u015f]] as Dusan Gavrich {{small|(phonetic of \"Du\u0161an Gavri\u0107\")}}\n* [[Aleksandr Baluev]] as Russian Army General Aleksandr Kodoroff\n* [[Rene Medve\u0161ek]] as Vlado Mirich {{small|(phonetic of \"Miri\u0107\")}}\n* Gary Werntz as Hamilton\n* [[Randall Batinkoff]] as Ken\n* Jim Haynie as General Garnett\n* Alexander Strobele as Shummaker\n* [[Holt McCallany]] as Appleton\n* [[Michael Boatman]] as CPN Beach\n* [[Joan Copeland]] as Senator Bevens\n* [[Carlos G\u00f3mez (actor)|Carlos G\u00f3mez]] as Santiago\n* [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]] as [[Federal Security Service]] Colonel Dimitri Vertikoff\n}}\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\n''The Peacemaker'' earned $41,263,140 in the US and $69,200,000 elsewhere, bringing its total to $110,463,140.<ref name=\"BOM\" />\n\n===Critical reception===\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 46% approval rating based on 37 reviews, with an average score of 6/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1079516_peacemaker|title=The Peacemaker (1997)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=September 29, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220408001653/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1079516-peacemaker|archive-date=April 8, 2022|url-status=live}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 43 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Peacemaker (1997) Reviews|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-peacemaker|website=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=October 17, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813015323/https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-peacemaker|archive-date=August 13, 2021|url-status=live}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave praise to Clooney and Kidman for portraying a \"charming rogue\" and expressing \"womanly professionalism as fierce, hostile sterneness\" in their respective roles and Leder's direction of the movie's action setpieces, highlighting the Manhattan climax for having \"crisp economy and furious energy\" throughout the scene.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/film/peacemaker-film-review.html|title=The Cold War Is Back, Nuclear Bombs and All|last=Maslin|first=Janet|author-link=Janet Maslin|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 26, 1997|access-date=September 4, 2021}}</ref> Marc Savlov of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' said that despite the \"ever-present plot holes and isoscelean character arcs\" throughout the film's story and villains, he praised Leder's directorial skills for keeping things fresh throughout the runtime and adding \"clever swagger\" to the action scenes, concluding that: \"By no means an embarrassment to the fledgling DreamWorks, ''The Peacemaker'' is instead a grand, noisy step in the right direction.
