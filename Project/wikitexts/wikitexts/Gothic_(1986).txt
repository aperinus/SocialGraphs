It features a soundtrack by [[Thomas Dolby]], and marks Richardson's and Cyr's film debut.\n\nThe film is a fictionalized retelling of the Shelleys' visit to Lord Byron in [[Villa Diodati]] by [[Lake Geneva]], shot in [[Gaddesden Place]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gypsyartshow.com/2011/09/ken-russells-gothic-movie-review-by.html |title=Ken Russell's GOTHIC, movie review |last=Coke |first=Travis Hedge |date=14 September 2011 |website=The Gypsy Art Show |access-date=2015-03-13}}</ref> It concerns their competition to write a [[horror fiction|horror story]], which ultimately led to Mary Shelley writing ''[[Frankenstein]]'' and John Polidori writing \"[[The Vampyre]].\" The same event has also been portrayed in the films ''[[Mary Shelley (film)|Mary Shelley]]'' (with [[Elle Fanning]] as Mary Shelley),  ''[[Haunted Summer]]'' (1988) (with [[Alice Krige]] as Mary Shelley) among others, and alluded to in ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935) (with [[Elsa Lanchester]] as Mary Shelley and the Bride of the Monster).\n\nThe film's poster motif is based on [[Henry Fuseli]]'s 1781 painting ''[[The Nightmare]]'', which is also referenced in the film.\n\n==Plot== \nThrough her stepsister [[Claire Clairmont]], [[Mary Shelley|Mary Godwin]] and her future husband [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Percy Shelley]] come to know [[Lord Byron]]. During the summer of 1816, Lord Byron invites them to stay for a while at Villa Diodati in Switzerland. There they meet Byron's physician friend, [[John William Polidori|Dr. John Polidori]]. On 16 June, while a storm rages outside, the five of them amuse themselves by engaging in a game of [[hide-and-seek]]. Later in a parlor, Percy proclaims his fascination with science; Polidori tells him of his interests in [[sleepwalking]] and [[nightmare]]s. Lord Byron shows his guests ''Phantasmagoria'', a book of horror stories he purchased from a shop in [[Geneva]], and the three alternately read excerpts. This inspires them to hold a [[s\u00e9ance]] gathered around a human skull, during which Claire has an apparent [[seizure]]. Mary describes them as Claire's \"horrors,\" and recalls instances during their childhood when unexplained phenomena would occur during them, such as Claire's bed inexplicably shaking, and doors slamming shut by themselves. Polidori brings Claire upstairs to rest.\n\nDuring the night, Mary witnesses a shadowy apparition outside the window she and Claire share. Believing Mary was startled by a slamming barn door outside, Percy goes to shut it. While investigating the barn, he is startled by a grotesque creature. Mary speaks with Lord Byron in the billiard room, confronting him about his intentions with Claire, and reveals to him that Claire is pregnant with his child. He suggests she has an [[abortion]], and the two argue, resulting in a physical confrontation.\n\nLater, Lord Byron performs [[oral sex]] on Claire, during which she has a [[miscarriage]]. Meanwhile, Mary consoles Percy, who has grown increasingly paranoid and claims to smell an overpowering scent of decay. From the bottom of the staircase, Mary hears a noise, and feels liquid dripping on her. As she looks up, she sees Polidori leaning over the banister, clutching a bleeding wound on his neck. Once the bleeding is controlled, he claims to have been bitten by a vampire in his room. Byron accuses him of self-inflicting the wounds, while Percy and Mary believe him. Percy raves that the group collectively gave birth to something during the s\u00e9ance, manifesting their worst fears, while Polidori is scared of [[damnation]] for his [[homosexuality]]. He attempts to poison himself to death with cyanide, but is stopped by Byron.\n\nClaire goes missing from her bedroom, and is discovered by Percy; he watches in horror as her breasts metamorphose into eyes; Mary attempts to flee the house, and inadvertently crashes through a glass door. Percy infers that the presence haunting them is feeding off of the group's fear. During a failed attempt to hang himself in the barn, Polidori witnesses a figure flee on horseback. Percy and Byron attempt to recreate the s\u00e9ance to banish their creation. Byron and Percy, both [[atheism|atheists]], believe it must be returned to the recesses of their minds, while Mary questions the metaphysical and supernatural events plaguing them.\n\nIn the basement, the three discover Claire nude and covered in mud. Byron attempts to hold the s\u00e9ance there, but Mary refuses. During the event, Mary crushes the skull, and attempts to stab Byron with a shard. Percy stops her, and begins kissing Byron passionately. As she flees through the home, Mary witnesses an apparition of her son, William, in a coffin, followed by a [[Hallucination|vision]] of her suffering a miscarriage. In the madness, she attempts to throw herself off a balcony, but is stopped by Percy. Mary awakens the following morning and joins Byron, Percy, and Claire in the garden.\n\nIn the contemporary era, tourists visit the Villa. A voice-over informs that Mary's son, William, died three years after that night in June 1816, followed by Percy's drowning in 1822; Byron would die two years after Percy, and Polidori committed suicide in London. From Mary's previous experience of miscarriage came the desire to raise her child from the dead, which led to her writing ''[[Frankenstein]]''. From Polidori's homosexuality, suicidal thoughts, and fascination with vampires came the story \"[[The Vampyre]].\"\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Gabriel Byrne]] as [[Lord Byron]]\n*[[Julian Sands]] as [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]\n*[[Natasha Richardson]] as [[Mary Shelley]]\n*[[Myriam Cyr]] as [[Claire Clairmont]]\n*[[Timothy Spall]] as [[John William Polidori|Dr. John William Polidori]]\n*[[Alec Mango]] as Murray\n*[[Andreas Wisniewski]] as Fletcher\n*[[Dexter Fletcher]] as Ruston\n*[[Tom Hickey (actor)|Tom Hickey]], as Tour Guide\n\n==Basis in reality==\n[[File:Gaddesden Place-geograph-1948455-by-Tom-Presland.jpg|thumb|[[Gaddesden Place]] in Hertfordshire, England, was used as a location for Villa Diodati]]\nThe film fictionalizes an actual meeting that took place between Mary Godwin, Percy Shelley, and Claire Clairemont at the Villa Diodati in Geneva, hosted by Lord Byron.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|title=AT THE MOVIES|author=Darnton, Nina|date=10 April 1987|page=C7|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=25 November 2017|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DE4D8173BF933A25757C0A961948260}}</ref> It has been suggested by some historians and journalists that the events of their meeting which inspired Shelley's ''Frankenstein'' and Polidori's \"The Vampyre\" were triggered by the group's use of [[opium]] during their vacation together.<ref name=nyt/> Discussing the film's basis in reality, actor Sands commented:\n\n{{blockquote|I think these portraits are rooted in reality.

He sent it to Al Clark, head of [[Virgin Films]]. Clark said \"it was worlds removed from the scripts that one predominantly gets in this country, with their literary ambience and dependence on a sort of linguistic authenticity. I felt it offered a perfect springboard to a director.\"<ref name=\"sight\"/>\n\nAfter seeing ''Crimes of Passion'', Clark offered the film to Ken Russell who accepted. Volk admits to having \"slight misgivings\" when Clark mentioned Russell's name \"but when I met Ken I found, somehow to my surprise, that he was very easy to get on with\".<ref>Volk story\nPulleine, Tim. The Guardian 26 Feb 1987: 13.</ref> Russell worked on a further draft of the script with Volk which made relatively minor changes.<ref name=\"sight\"/>\n\nRussell had been interested in Byron and Shelley's meeting for a decade. He said \"About 10 years ago, Robert Powell, the actor, approached me with a script covering the same time span and events. But we couldn't raise the money. I think it was a little too poetic and not as scary as it might have been.\" Russell say ''Gothic'' as \"a sort of black comedy; some of the others have been slightly more serious.

With James Ivory you are on a carousel, but with Ken Russell you are on a roller coaster. James Ivory is like an Indian miniaturist, and Ken Russell is a graffiti artist.

Yet I treasure this film. So may you. If you, as am I, are out of your head... you will cleave to this tortured bit of cinematic epilepsy because it is ALIVE. It is yet another crime of passion committed by Ken Russell, and his sort of berserk creativity has fallen on such hard times in this age of Reagan and yuppie sensibility, that simply to be exposed to the ravings of an inspired madman is cathartic. I came away from GOTHIC with my soul on fire... The final assertion of critical judgement on GOTHIC is not whether or not it is good, or whether one likes it or not. The undeniable truth of GOTHIC, as in all the work of Ken Russell (an artist who is either so mad or so foolhardy as not to care if he wins or loses), is that it is palpably ALIVE. It is riot and ruin and pandemonium. But it will have you by the nerve-ends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenvolk.net/HARLAN.pdf|title=Review|website=Stephen Volk}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Accolades===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n''Gothic'' was nominated for three 1987 International Fantasy Film Awards and won two: Gabriel Byrne won as Best Actor, both for his role as Lord Byron in this film and for his role in ''[[Defence of the Realm]]'', and the film won for Best Special Effects.
