The film tells the story of Anna ([[Naomi Watts]]), a [[Russians in the United Kingdom|Russian-British]] midwife who delivers the baby of a drug-addicted 14-year old Russian prostitute who dies in childbirth. After Anna learns that the teen was [[sex trafficking|forced into prostitution]] by the [[Russian Mafia]] in [[London]], the leader of the Russian gangsters ([[Armin Mueller-Stahl]]) threatens the baby, and Anna is warned off by a strong-arm man ([[Viggo Mortensen]]).\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in November 2006, in locations in and around London. The film has been noted for its treatment of the subject of [[sex trafficking]], and for its violence and realistic depiction of Russian career criminals, which includes detailed portrayal of the tattoos which indicate their crimes and criminal status. ''Eastern Promises'' received critical acclaim, appearing on several critics' \"top 10 films\" lists for 2007 and has since become a [[cult film]]. The film has won several awards, including the Audience Prize for best film at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and the Best Actor award for Mortensen at the [[British Independent Film Awards]]. The film received twelve [[Genie Award]] nominations and three [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations. Mortensen was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].\n\n==Plot==\nAnna Khitrova, a [[midwife]] at a London hospital, finds a Russian-language diary on the body of Tatiana, a teenage girl who dies in childbirth, and a calling card for the Trans-Siberian Restaurant owned by Semyon, an old [[Thief in law|vor]] in the [[Russian mafia]]. Anna sets out to track down Tatiana's family so that she can find a home for the baby, and meets with Semyon, who offers to help. Though Anna's mother Helen is open to the idea, Anna's Russian uncle Stepan, a former [[KGB]] officer, urges caution, saying that Tatiana was a prostitute. Anna also gives Semyon a photocopy of the diary.\n\nSemyon's driver, Nikolai Luzhin, serves as the family \"[[Fixer (person)|cleaner]]\" and bodyguard of Kirill, Semyon's son. Kirill, a drunk who repeatedly disappoints Semyon, authorizes an ill-advised hit on a rival Chechen leader with the help of a Kurdish associate, Azim, and without Semyon's approval. Kirill spits on the dead Chechen's body, calling him a [[Pederasty|pederast]], but Nikolai later tells Semyon that the Chechen had been spreading rumors that Kirill was gay. Nikolai removes identifying evidence from the Chechen's body and dumps it in the [[River Thames]].\n\nWhen Stepan finishes translating Tatiana's diary, Anna learns that Semyon raped Tatiana after Kirill failed to do so, explaining that he would show Kirill how to \"break\" her. The diary also states that Semyon gave her pills to induce an abortion, and Anna realizes that the baby was fathered by Semyon. Meanwhile, Semyon realizes that Anna knows the truth about the baby and visits her at the hospital. He strikes a deal wherein he will give the location of the girl's family to Anna if she returns the diary. Later, Anna, Helen and Stepan meet Nikolai in a fast food restaurant, where Nikolai takes the diary but denies knowing anything about the deal. Semyon then orders Nikolai to kill Stepan, saying that a Russian cannot be trusted with the information, and Stepan soon goes missing.\n\nAs Nikolai rises in rank, Semyon sponsors him as a full member, due in part to Nikolai's protection of Kirill. Meanwhile, the dead Chechen's brothers arrive in London seeking vengeance, and kill Azim's mentally handicapped nephew, whom Azim had forced to kill the Chechen. Azim confesses his role in the hit to Semyon, and Semyon forgives him in exchange for participating in a plan to fool the Chechens: Azim is to lure Nikolai into a meeting at a bath house where he will be ambushed by the Chechens, who believe that he is Kirill. Though the Chechens seriously wound him, Nikolai manages to kill them both before being taken to Anna's hospital.\n\nYuri, a high-ranking [[Scotland Yard]] officer with responsibility for the Russian mafia, meets Nikolai in the hospital, revealing that Nikolai is actually an undercover [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]] agent working under license from the British government. Nikolai tells Yuri to have Semyon arrested for [[statutory rape]], with a paternity test of Tatiana's baby as evidence, which will also allow Nikolai to take over the mafia. Anna confronts Nikolai in his hospital bed, and he tells her that Stepan is safe, in a 5-star hotel in [[Edinburgh]] where Nikolai sent him for his own protection. She then spots Kirill entering a lift and finds that Tatiana's baby is gone, replaced with a bouquet of roses. She and Nikolai then rush to the spot on the Thames where Nikolai had previously disposed of the Chechen's body and find Kirill sitting by the river, working up the courage to throw his baby sister. Nikolai and Anna persuade him to give the baby back, and Nikolai embraces Kirill, telling him that Semyon is finished, and that they will now be bosses together. Soon after, Nikolai succeeds Semyon as head of the organization, and Anna gains custody of Tatiana's baby, whom she names Christine.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Anna \"Anya\" Ivanovna Khitrova\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as Nikolai Luzhin\n* [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]] as Semyon\n* [[Vincent Cassel]] as Kirill Semyonovich\n* [[Sin\u00e9ad Cusack]] as Helen\n* Mina E.

Filming also took place in [[Broadway Market, London|Broadway Market]], [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and in [[Brompton Cemetery]] in the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea|London Borough of Kensington & Chelsea]]. The \"Trans-Siberian Restaurant\" is located in [[The Farmiloe Building]],<ref>[https://archive.today/20081231211410/http://www.locationworks.com/8889 \"Pictures of the Farmiloe Building at LocationWorks.com\"].{{Dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref> 34 [[St John Street, London|St John Street]], next to [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield Market]].

The Broadway Market hair dresser known as \"Broadway Gents Hairstylist\" was changed to \"Azim's Hair Salon\", where in the film one of the Russians is murdered. The owner Mr. Ismail Yesiloglu decided to keep most of the shop front after filming. In the original script, the name was \"Ozim's Hair Salon\", but it was later changed to \"Azim's\" as there is no such name as Ozim in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. The \"Trafalgar Hospital\" is actually the [[Middlesex Hospital]], a hospital in the [[Fitzrovia]] area of London, which closed to patients in December 2005. The building in central London, which was knocked down in 2008, had the inscription 'Trafalgar Hospital', matching the style and apparent age of the old Middlesex Hospital, inserted into the legend above the main door. The fight scene in the Turkish Baths was filmed on a custom set<ref>Per DVD commentary.</ref> based on the [[Ironmonger Row Baths]] in [[Islington]].\n\n''Eastern Promises'' was David Cronenberg's first film to be shot entirely outside Canada.\n\n===Tattoos===\n{{See also|Russian criminal tattoos}}\nViggo Mortensen studied Russian gangsters and their tattoos. Mortensen spent a lot of time with a Russian Mafia specialist, Gilly McKenzie (organised crime specialist for the UN) and also consulted a documentary on the subject called ''[[The Mark of Cain (2000 film)|The Mark of Cain]]'' (2000).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2007/09/09/2007-09-09_viggo_mortensen_digs_into_naked_emotiona.html |title=Viggo Mortensen digs into naked emotional turf |access-date=September 26, 2007 |author=John Clark |date=September 9, 2007 |work=[[New York Daily News]] |archive-date=December 2, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202114035/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2007/09/09/2007-09-09_viggo_mortensen_digs_into_naked_emotiona.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> The tattoos that he wore, according to the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', were so realistic that diners in a Russian restaurant in London fell silent out of fear, until Mortensen revealed his identity and admitted the tattoos were for a film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ekstrabladet.dk/flash/filmogtv/film/article191518.ece  |title=Viggo is frightening (original Danish title: Viggo er skr\u00e6mmende) |access-date=September 26, 2007 |author=Nanna Louise Teckemeier |date=January 18, 2007 |work=[[Ekstra Bladet]]|language=da}}</ref> From that day on he washed off his tattoos whenever he went off the set. Mortensen said of the significance of the tattoos:\n\n<blockquote>I talked to them [authentic gangsters and Gilly McKenzie] about what they meant and where they were on the body, what that said about where they'd been, what their specialties were, what their ethnic and geographical affiliations were. Basically their history, their calling card, is their body.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/oscar-acting-nominees-speak-article-1.310149 |title=Oscar acting nominees speak out |work=NyDailyNews.com |date=February 21, 2008 |access-date=October 15, 2013}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Violence===\nConsistent with the trademark violence in much of Cronenberg's work, ''Eastern Promises'' features a graphically violent fight scene in a steam bath where the combatants wield [[Linoleum knife|linoleum knives]]. When asked in an interview about the difference between \"[[gun violence]]\" and \"knife violence,\" Cronenberg replied, \"We have no guns in this movie. There were no guns in the script. The choice of those curved knives we use in the steam bath was mine. They're not some kind of exotic Turkish knives, they're linoleum knives. I felt that these guys could walk around in the streets with these knives, and if they were ever caught, they could say 'we're linoleum cutters'.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmcomment.com/article/foreign-affairs-david-cronenbergs-eastern-promises/a-blast-from-the-past-joe-strummer-interview |title=''Eastern Promises'' |access-date=March 10, 2013 |work=Film Society Lincoln Center}}</ref>\n\n==Director's commentary==\nAdam Nayman of ''[[Eye Weekly]]'' reported that director Cronenberg said \"just don't give the plot away\" and Nayman wrote \"his request is understandable.\" Nayman said \"there is one scene \u2013 the in-depth discussion of which prompted the director's anti-spoiler request referenced at the top of this story \u2013 that should rank not only in his personal pantheon of spectacularly deployed gore but among the most exhilaratingly visceral patches of cinema, period, full stop.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_08.30.07/film/feature.php |title=INDELIBLE INK |access-date=October 22, 2007 |author=Adam Nayman |date=August 30, 2007 |work=[[Eye Weekly]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522151717/http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_08.30.07/film/feature.php |archive-date=May 22, 2011  }}</ref> ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' critic [[Roger Ebert]] noted Cronenberg's quote and agreed, saying: \"He is correct that it would be fatal, because this is not a movie of what or how, but of why.
