It was a remake of the 1936 [[Frank Capra]] film ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'', which itself was based on the 1935 short story ''Opera Hat'' by [[Clarence Budington Kelland]].\n\n==Plot==\nMulti-billionaire Preston Blake freezes to death upon reaching the top of [[Mount Everest]]. With no immediate heir, it is unclear who will inherit Blake's massive fortune. His board of directors discover that he has a living grandnephew named Longfellow Deeds, who runs a [[pizzeria]] in Mandrake Falls, [[New Hampshire]], and also writes [[greeting card]]s. Deeds is flown to [[New York City]] by businessman Chuck Cedar, who temporarily controls Blake Media. Once Deeds arrives, plans are made for him to sell his shares in the company to Cedar and return home with $40 billion. Deeds remains in New York while the legal details are worked out.\n\nThe story is major news and [[Journalist|reporter]] Babe Bennett, who works for a [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] television show called ''Inside Access'', wants in on the inside story. She has co-worker Marty pretend to steal her purse in sight of Deeds, who \"rescues\" Babe. She then goes out with him pretending to be \"Pam Dawson\", a [[School nursing|school nurse]] from [[Iowa]]. Though Babe initially just wanted a career-advancing story, she eventually falls for the unfailingly soft-hearted Deeds. She decides to tell him who she really is, but ''Inside Access'', in concert with Cedar (who learned the truth from Marty) reveals the truth to Deeds first. Heartbroken, Deeds decides to return home to Mandrake Falls with assurances that the company will stay open in Blake's honor, and he donates his $40 billion to the [[United Negro College Fund]].\n\nAfter returning to Mandrake Falls, Deeds learns from his friend Crazy Eyes that Cedar intends to sell the company, causing thousands of employees to lose their jobs. Babe follows Deeds to Mandrake Falls to win him back. After saving her life when she falls through the ice over a lake, he rejects her, saying he does not really know who she is.\n\nAt a shareholders' meeting, Cedar has persuaded everyone to sell the company until Deeds, who has bought a single share, arrives and convinces everyone not to sell. However, Cedar controls a majority of the shares and the sale is approved. Babe arrives after having studied Blake's stolen diary and has determined Blake's longtime [[butler]] Emilio Lopez is actually his [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate son]] and the true heir as a result of an affair with his maid. Emilio immediately takes control of Blake Media and fires Cedar. Babe reconciles with Deeds after professing she loves him. Emilio thanks Deeds for his support and gives him a billion dollars.\n\nDeeds spends some of his money on red [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvettes]] for everyone in Mandrake Falls, and returns to the pizzeria with Babe.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Longfellow Deeds, Preston Blake's great nephew, a friendly, helpful owner of a small-town pizzeria who also writes greeting cards who inherited a billion-dollar empire from his late uncle.\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as Babe Bennett, a reporter for the tabloid television show ''Inside Access'', who disguises herself as Pam Dawson, a school nurse, to get close to and gather information on Deeds.\n* [[Peter Gallagher]] as Chuck Cedar, the CEO for Blake Media and Preston Blake's longtime number two who plots to seize control of Blake Media so he can make a huge profit selling it.\n* [[Jared Harris]] as Mac McGrath, the Australian head of ''Inside Access'' who reports on Deeds' antics in New York.\n* [[Allen Covert]] as Marty, a junior reporter for ''Inside Access'', infatuated with and a cohort of Babe, appearing in several disguises to spy on Deeds.\n* [[Erick Avari]] as Cecil Anderson, the [[general counsel]] for Blake Media.\n* [[John Turturro]] as Emilio Lopez, Preston Blake's long-serving butler and illegitimate son (therefore Deeds' long-lost cousin and the true heir to Blake Media).
