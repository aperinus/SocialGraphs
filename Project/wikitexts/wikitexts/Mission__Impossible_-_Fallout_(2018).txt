It is the sequel to ''[[Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation]]'' (2015) and is the sixth installment in the [[Mission: Impossible (film series)|''Mission: Impossible'' film series]]. The film stars [[Tom Cruise]], [[Ving Rhames]], [[Simon Pegg]], [[Rebecca Ferguson]], [[Henry Cavill]], [[Sean Harris]], [[Michelle Monaghan]], and [[Alec Baldwin]]. In ''Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout'', [[Ethan Hunt]] (Cruise) and his [[Impossible Missions Force]] (IMF) team seek to prevent nuclear weapon technology from reaching the Apostles, a bioterrorist offshoot of the Syndicate.\n\nTalks for a sixth ''Mission: Impossible'' film began before the release of its predecessor in 2015. ''Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout'' was officially announced in November 2015, with McQuarrie confirmed to write and direct, thus becoming the first director to return to the franchise. The returns of the cast were announced soon after; [[Jeremy Renner]], who appeared in the previous two films, confirmed his absence at [[CinemaCon]] in March 2017, due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019). [[Principal photography]] began in April 2017 and lasted until March 2018, with filming locations including [[Paris]], [[New Zealand]], [[London]], [[Norway]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Production was notably put on hold for seven weeks following an injury to Cruise in August 2017.\n\n''Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout'' premiered in Paris on July 12, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States in [[RealD 3D]] and [[IMAX]] (a first for the series) by [[Paramount Pictures]] on July 27. It received critical acclaim, with praise for its action sequences, McQuarrie's direction and screenplay, and the cast performances (particularly Cruise's); it is widely considered to be the best installment in the franchise.<ref name=\"SREarly\"/><ref name=\"BBCEarly\"/> The film grossed $791 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in the franchise, the [[2018 in film|eighth-highest-grossing film of 2018]], and the then-highest-grossing film of Cruise's career (until 2022's ''[[Top Gun: Maverick]]''). The sequel, ''[[Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One]]'', is scheduled for release in July 2023.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP: FILM PLOT, plot summaries for feature films should only be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nTwo years after [[Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation|Solomon Lane's capture]], the remnants of his organization The Syndicate have reorganized as a terrorist group known as the Apostles, having adopted the 'Terror for hire' policy. They are hired by an extremist known as John Lark, and are attempting to acquire three stolen [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|plutonium cores]] for him to use in three nuclear bombs. IMF agent [[Ethan Hunt]] is assigned to recover the plutonium, and arranges a meeting to purchase the cores, but the Apostles intervene and take fellow teammate [[Luther Stickell]] hostage. Ethan chooses to save Stickell, allowing the Apostles to steal the cores. The IMF team later captures Norwegian [[nuclear weapons]] expert Nils Delbruuk, whom the CIA believes is building weapons for Lark. Using a fake broadcast of teammate Benji Dunn posing as [[CNN]]'s [[Wolf Blitzer]], they trick Delbruuk into unlocking a phone he used to communicate with Lark.\n\nFurious at the IMF's failure to secure the plutonium, [[CIA Director]] Erika Sloane instructs [[Special Activities Division]] Agent August Walker to accompany Hunt on a mission to retrieve it. Hunt and Walker infiltrate a Paris nightclub where Lark is supposed to purchase the plutonium from the Apostles, with arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis acting as broker. They track a man they suspect to be Lark, but after an intense fight in the men's restroom, the man is killed by [[MI6]] agent Ilsa Faust. Hunt assumes the identity of Lark and meets with Mitsopolis, but the meeting is cut short when hitmen attack them. In exchange for the plutonium, Mitsopolis tasks Hunt with extracting Lane from an armored convoy moving through Paris, and provides one of the cores as a down payment. \n\nHunt and Walker preemptively attack the convoy to prevent Mitsopolis\u2019 brother Zola and their men from killing local police. Ramming Lane's vehicle into water, they lead police and Mitsopolis's men on a chase while Dunn and Stickell secure Lane. Faust reappears and attempts to kill Lane under orders direct from MI6, but Hunt escapes with Lane. Mitsopolis then instructs Hunt to deliver Lane to [[London]]. At a London safe house, IMF Secretary Hunley orders Hunt to stop the mission and turn himself in after receiving doctored evidence implicating Hunt as Lark. The team trick Walker into admitting he is the real Lark and inform Sloane, who sends a CIA unit to take everyone into custody. Unbeknownst to Sloane, the unit has been infiltrated by the Apostles and Walker signals them to attack. \n\nWalker kills Hunley and Hunt pursues him to an elevator, where Walker tells him that he must turn himself in and admit he's Lark or he will kill his former wife Julia. The team track Lane and Walker to a medical camp over the [[Siachen Glacier]]. Faust deduces that Lane is planning to detonate the nuclear bombs at the medical camp, contaminating the water supply of [[India]], [[Pakistan]], and [[China]]. The bombs are linked by a failsafe; any attempt to defuse one bomb without also disarming the detonator will automatically trigger the other. At the camp, Hunt discovers Julia and her new husband Erik. Lane programs the bombs' detonator with a 15-minute countdown and gives it to Walker, choosing to remain with the bombs. \n\nWalker takes off in a helicopter secretly pursued by Hunt while Dunn, Stickell, and Faust try to find and defuse the nuclear weapons. Julia helps Stickell disarm the first bomb but they are unable to defuse it without the detonator. Faust finds the second bomb but is ambushed and subdued by Lane; Dunn and Faust eventually overpower him. Following an aerial chase, Hunt uses a hijacked helicopter to ram Walker's helicopter out of the sky. The two men fight on the edge of a cliff before Hunt kills Walker by dropping a hook attached to a helicopter on him. Hunt secures the detonator, allowing the team to deactivate the bombs. In the aftermath, Sloane hands Lane over to MI6 through Mitsopolis, with Faust earning her exoneration. Julia tells Hunt that he has given her the best life, despite his commitment to the IMF. Sloane praises Hunt for his actions.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as [[Ethan Hunt]], an agent of the [[Impossible Missions Force]] (IMF)\n* [[Henry Cavill]] as August Walker, an assassin working for Sloane in the [[Special Activities Division]] of the CIA sent to monitor Ethan and his team.\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as [[Luther Stickell]], an IMF agent, a long running member of Hunt's team and a computer hacker\n* [[Simon Pegg]] as Benji Dunn, an IMF technical field agent and a member of Hunt's team\n* [[Rebecca Ferguson]] as Ilsa Faust, a former [[MI6]] agent who allied with Hunt at Paris, London, and the Siachen Glacier\n* [[Sean Harris]] as Solomon Lane, an anarchist mastermind who was the leader of the Syndicate, later known as the Apostles\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as Erika Sloane, the new Director of the CIA replacing Hunley, and Walker's superior\n* [[Vanessa Kirby]] as Alanna Mitsopolis / White Widow, an arms dealer and the daughter of Max, whom Hunt arrested during the events of [[Mission: Impossible (film)| the first film]]\n* [[Michelle Monaghan]] as Julia Meade, a doctor and Ethan's ex-wife\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Alan Hunley, the former Director of the CIA who later became the new IMF Secretary\n* [[Wes Bentley]] as Erik, Julia's husband\n* [[Frederick Schmidt]] as Zola Mitsopolis, Alanna's brother\n* [[Ross O'Hennessy]] as a British agent\n* Liang Yang as the John Lark decoy\n* [[Kristoffer Joner]] as Nils Delbruuk, a Norwegian rogue nuclear weapons specialist\n* [[Alix B\u00e9n\u00e9zech]] as the French policewoman whom Ethan saves from Alanna\u2019s and Zola's men in Paris\n* [[Caspar Phillipson]] as a plutonium dealer\n* [[Wolf Blitzer]] as himself, a disguise worn by Dunn\n\n== Production ==\n=== Pre-production ===\nOn May 23, 2015, ''The Tracking Board'' reported that [[Paramount Pictures]] was developing a sixth ''Mission: Impossible'' film, with [[Tom Cruise]], [[J. J. Abrams]], [[David Ellison]], and Dana Goldberg returning to produce, along with [[Don Granger]] and Matt Grimm as executive producers, and Elizabeth Raposo overseeing development.<ref name=\"May2015TB\"/> On July 28, 2015, Cruise confirmed on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' that a sixth film was already being developed, and told its host [[Jon Stewart]] that the filming would \"probably\" commence in summer 2016.<ref name=\"July2015Variety\"/> On August 2, 2015, Paramount executive [[Rob Moore (executive)|Rob Moore]] told ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that the sequel was already in the works, stating that they were \"very happy to be developing this movie with Tom,\" and \"there has to be another movie.\"<ref name=\"Aug2015Variety\"/> On November 19, 2015, it was announced that Paramount had again hired [[Christopher McQuarrie]] to write the film, while it was possible that he would also direct again. The studio was moving fast, with plans to begin shooting in August 2016.<ref name=\"McQuarrieWriting\"/> On November 30, 2015, McQuarrie confirmed through his Twitter account that he would be back for directing duty as well, and also produce the film along with Cruise.<ref name=\"Nov2015T\"/><ref name=\"Nov2015D\"/> \nOn August 19, 2016, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' wrote that Paramount had halted pre-production on the film for a dispute over salary between Cruise and the studio, as Cruise wanted to be paid equal to or more than his fee for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[The Mummy (2017 film)|The Mummy]]''.<ref name=\"Halted\"/> On September 16, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' confirmed that Cruise's dispute with the studio had been resolved. Production would now begin in spring 2017.<ref name=\"DisputeResolved\"/> In November, [[Jeremy Renner]]\u2014who portrayed William Brandt in the [[Mission: Impossible&nbsp;\u2013 Ghost Protocol|fourth]] and [[Mission: Impossible&nbsp;\u2013 Rogue Nation|fifth]] films\u2014stated that he was unsure if he would be part of the sixth film because of scheduling conflicts with his role as [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hawkeye]] in [[Marvel Studios]]' ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"CBRIW\"/> In March 2017, it was confirmed at [[CinemaCon]] that he would not return for the sixth film.<ref name=CinemaCon/>\n\nIn February, McQuarrie revealed that the film would include more backstory to Ethan Hunt's personal life.<ref name=\"CBBackstory\"/> On June 13, 2017, [[Michelle Monaghan]] was announced to return as Ethan Hunt's wife Julia Meade-Hunt.<ref name=\"Patrick Hipes\"/>\n\n=== Filming ===\nFilming was slated to start in Paris on April 10, 2017.<ref name=\"CSMcQuarrie\"/> Other locations included London, New Zealand and Norway.<ref name=\"SRIMAX\"/><ref name=\"Aftenposten\"/> Filming officially began on April 8.<ref name=\"EWFilming\"/> Some of the filming also took place in New Zealand in July 2017.<ref name=\"CSNZ\"/> The municipality of [[Forsand]] in Norway allowed the closing of [[Preikestolen]] ('Pulpit Rock') for a time in autumn for the film's shoot; only crew members and cast were allowed to approach the mountain for nine consecutive days. They also were allowed up to 50 helicopter landings per day.<ref name=\"Dagbladet\"/> The scenes set in the Indian-administered territory of [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] were shot in New Zealand. Director Christopher McQuarrie said that he wanted the climax of the film to be set in a more \"politically complex\" location than New Zealand, so he chose to set this sequence in [[Kashmir]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/hollywood/mission-impossible-fallout-was-on-the-hunt-for-a-more-political-story-hence-kashmir/story-Onv2ZGEh5Ws1PoUFXdDOLN.html|title=Mission Impossible Fallout was on the hunt for a more political story, hence Kashmir|work=Hindustan Times|date=July 12, 2018|access-date=December 27, 2021}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2017, Cruise injured his right leg on the London set during filming.<ref name=\"TMZInjury\"/><ref name=\"LATimesInjury\"/><ref name=\"DeadlineInjury\"/> Following the accident, the studio announced it would halt production for at least nine weeks for Cruise's broken ankle and other injuries to heal, but released a statement saying that they would be keeping the July 2018 release date for the film. The injury resulted in a cost of around $80 million for the studio because they had to pay the cast and crew for the eight-week hiatus so they would not take another job. However, the injury and subsequent costs were offset by insurance. They did not count against the film's final budget.<ref name=\"THRInjury\"/> Filming resumed in early October 2017, with Cruise spotted on the set seven weeks after his initial injury and two weeks earlier than initially planned.<ref name=\"ColliderInjury\"/>\n\nReshoots for Cavill's ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' coincided with the schedule for ''Fallout'', for which he had grown a mustache which he was contracted to keep while filming. While McQuarrie initially gave the producers of ''Justice League'' permission to have Cavill shave the mustache in exchange for the $3 million it would cost to shut down production on ''Fallout'' and then digitally fill the mustache in, executives from Paramount rejected the idea,<ref name=\"EmpireMustache\"/> forcing ''Justice League''{{'}}s VFX team to use special effects to digitally remove the mustache in post-production.<ref name=\"BIMustache\"/>\n\nOn January 25, 2018, the title was revealed to be ''Mission: Impossible&nbsp;\u2013 Fallout''.<ref name=\"EmpireTitle\"/> Filming wrapped in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on March 25, 2018.<ref name=\"WrapInstagram\"/> Production in the UAE included filming of a [[High-altitude military parachuting|High Altitude Low Opening (HALO)]] jump scene with Cruise. The scene required Cruise and the crew to train on a ground-based [[vertical wind tunnel]], and then use a [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III|C-17]] military aircraft to make over one hundred jumps from around {{convert|25000|ft}} to end up with three takes that McQuarrie wanted for the film. As the scene was to be set near sunset, they could only make one jump a day to try to get each shot.<ref name=\"USAHALO\"/><ref name=\"EWHALO\"/> One of the biggest challenges for the visual effects team was replacing the Abu Dhabi desert with Paris, which is where the jump takes place in the film. Artists re-created the [[Grand Palais]] des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es using reference imagery, [[Lidar]] scans, and photogrammetry from drone footage that was taken above the building.<ref name=\"VFXVoice\"/>\n\n===Visual effects===\nThe visual effects were provided by [[DNEG]] and Blind LTD and supervised by Huw Evans, Andrew Booth, and Jody Johnson with the help of One of Us and [[The Third Floor, Inc.|The Third Floor]].<ref>{{cite web|access-date=January 2, 2019|title=MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT - The Art of VFXThe Art of VFX|url=https://www.artofvfx.com/mission-impossible-fallout/|website=www.artofvfx.com}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout (soundtrack)}}\nThe [[Film score|musical score]] for ''Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout'' was composed by [[Lorne Balfe]]. McQuarrie confirmed Balfe to be the composer for the film in April 2018, replacing the previous composer and longtime collaborator [[Joe Kraemer (composer)|Joe Kraemer]].<ref name=\"FilmMusicReporter\"/> Balfe was given eight months to score the film and had a very collaborative process.\nThe score has been praised by many critics, calling it an epic and inspiring score, with some powerful themes which are balanced with softer, more sentimental ones;<ref name=\"VFScore\"/> some also considered it being too \"[[Christopher Nolan|Nolan]]-esque,\" comparing it to scores by [[Hans Zimmer]] (particularly ''[[The Dark Knight Rises (soundtrack)|The Dark Knight Rises]]'').<ref name=\"PolygonScore\"/> The score implements the use of percussion, snares, and bongos to create a jaunty staccato momentum.\n\nThe digital album was released through Paramount Music on July 14, 2018.
