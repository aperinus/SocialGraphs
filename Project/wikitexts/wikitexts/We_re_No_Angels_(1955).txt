Joseph is a thief, the other two are murderers.\n\nThey go to a store managed by Felix Ducotel. The store is in a very poor financial position as it is the only one to give supplies on credit. While there, they notice its roof is leaking, and offer to fix it for nothing. They get involved in selling things in the shop and have a knack for it, selling a brush set to a bald man, and getting the first cash income in a long time. They offer to make Christmas dinner for the family and the meal is very successful.\n\nThey do not actually intend to, but decide to remain there until nightfall, when they will steal clothes and supplies and escape on a ship waiting in the harbor. As they wait, they find that the small family of Felix, Amelie, and daughter Isabelle, is in financial distress and offer their services to hide the trio's all-too-sinister ruse. Joseph even gets to work conning people and falsifying records to make the store prosperous.  However, the three felons begin to have a change of heart after they fix a delicious Christmas dinner for the Ducotels made mostly of stolen items.\n\nTensions heighten after store owner Andre Trochard arrives from Paris with his nephew Paul, with a set of crocodile skin luggage. The Trochards plan on taking over the store, which they perceive is unprofitable due to its use of credit. Isabelle had planned to wed Paul but it turns out that Paul is betrothed to another woman, to Isabelle's dismay.  Before any action can be taken, both men are bitten by Albert's pet [[Viperidae|viper]], Adolphe, and die. Adolphe disappears and the three have to search for him.\n\nIsabelle finds another love, and the family is happy as the convicts finally ready for their postponed escape.  However, while waiting on the docks for their boat to arrive, the threesome reconsiders.  Judging that the outside world is likely to be worse than that of the prison, they decide to turn themselves back in.  As they walk toward it at film's end [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] appear over their heads...followed by one above the cage of Adolphe.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Humphrey Bogart]] as Joseph\n*[[Aldo Ray]] as Albert\n*[[Peter Ustinov]] as Jules\n*[[Joan Bennett]] as Amelie Ducotel\n*[[Basil Rathbone]] as Andre Trochard\n*[[Leo G.
