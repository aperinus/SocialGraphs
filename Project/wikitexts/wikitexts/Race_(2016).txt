Business Media]]|date=16 July 2014}}</ref> Directed by [[Stephen Hopkins (director)|Stephen Hopkins]] and written by Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse, the film stars [[Stephan James (actor)|Stephan James]] as Owens, and co-stars [[Jason Sudeikis]], [[Jeremy Irons]], [[William Hurt]] and [[Carice van Houten]]. It is a co-production of [[Cinema of Canada|Canada]], [[Cinema of Germany|Germany]] and [[Cinema of France|France]].<ref name=bfi/>\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on 24 July 2014, in [[Montreal]], Canada. Forecast Pictures, Solofilms and Trinity Race produced the film, supported by the Owens family, the Jesse Owens Foundation, the Jesse Owens Trust and the [[Luminary Group]].<ref name=\"Owens\" /> The film was a commercial success and received mixed to positive reviews, winning four [[5th Canadian Screen Awards|Canadian Screen Awards]], including [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for James.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Jesse Owens]], a promising [[African Americans|Black American]] runner, attends [[Ohio State University]], despite facing [[racial discrimination]] and slurs from the [[White Americans|White]] athletes. He attracts the attention of coach [[Larry Snyder (athlete)|Larry Snyder]], who believes Owens has enormous potential but needs work on his form and technique. When Snyder suggests he is good enough to compete at the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Olympic Games]], Owens is interested, but hesitant because of racial propaganda in [[Nazi Germany]]. The [[United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee|U.S. Olympic Committee]] is already considering boycotting the Olympics over Germany's discriminatory policies, only agreeing to participate when Nazi official [[Joseph Goebbels]] gives personal assurances they will allow foreign athletes of any race to compete, as well as promising to rein in their [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|propaganda]].\n\nAs Owens struggles to support his girlfriend Ruth and young daughter, he takes a job at a [[filling station|service station]], upsetting Snyder when his job conflicts with his commitment to train. When Snyder learns Owens has a family to support, he gets him a [[no-show job]], allowing him to focus on running. Owens goes on to break several records, including some of Snyder's, and begins a relationship with a woman whose attentions he attracts with his newfound fame. When Ruth threatens him with a lawsuit, Owens becomes distracted and loses a race to runner [[Eulace Peacock]]. Owens decides to return to Ruth to reconcile, convincing her to marry him. As the Olympics draw closer, the [[NAACP]] asks him not to go to Berlin for political reasons. Owens is conflicted, but Peacock urges him to compete to defy [[Nazism and race|Nazi racial ideology]].\n\nIn Berlin, Owens wins his first gold medal in the 100 m dash, but when he is brought by [[International Olympic Committee]] member [[Avery Brundage]] to receive congratulations from [[Adolf Hitler]], he is told the Chancellor has left the stadium early to avoid traffic. Brundage warns Goebbels that Hitler must congratulate all winners or none of them, to which Goebbels reply that Hitler will not appear with \"that\".\n\nOwens next qualifies for the [[long jump|broad jump]] after German rival [[Luz Long]] unexpectedly gives him tips on his technique. Owens wins another medal, and Luz publicly shakes his hand and joins him for a victory lap, privately expressing concern about national politics. Owens wins his fourth and final medal in the 4 x 100 m relay, filling in for two [[American Jews|Jewish American]] athletes cut by Brundage, who is convinced by Goebbels to do so to avoid a scandal over a business arrangement Brundage entered with the Nazis before the games. Director [[Leni Riefenstahl]] films the event against Goebbels' orders, then asks Owens to repeat his medal-winning broad jump to get a few more shots for her next film, ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Stephan James (actor)|Stephan James]] as [[Jesse Owens]]\n* [[Jason Sudeikis]] as [[Larry Snyder (athlete)|Larry Snyder]]\n* [[Jeremy Irons]] as [[Avery Brundage]]\n* [[Carice van Houten]] as [[Leni Riefenstahl]]\n* [[William Hurt]] as [[Jeremiah T.
