''U-571's'' skipper ''Kapit\u00e4nleutnant'' G\u00fcnther Wassner makes a distress call that is intercepted by American intelligence. The [[US Navy]] has its submarine ''S-33'' modified to resemble a German resupply U-boat, to try to steal the [[Enigma machine]] coding device and sink the ''U-571''. Before the crew of ''S-33'' receives its assignment, the submarine's executive officer Lieutenant Tyler is unhappy about a recommendation for command of his own submarine being blocked by his commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Dahlgren.\n\nDuring a storm, ''S-33's'' boarding party surprises and overwhelms the crew of ''U-571''. After securing ''U-571'', the American ''S-33'' is torpedoed by the arriving German resupply submarine.  Dahlgren is blown off the deck and seriously wounded; while struggling in the sea he refuses rescue and orders the boarding party on the captured U-boat immediately to submerge. Tyler takes command of ''U-571'' and dives below the surface, where they subsequently engage and sink the resupply submarine.\n\nAfter making repairs and restoring its power, Tyler decides to route the disabled submarine toward [[Land's End]] in [[Cornwall]]. However, they are spotted by a German reconnaissance plane, which is unaware that ''U-571'' has been commandeered by Americans. A nearby [[German World War II destroyers|German destroyer]] sends over some crew, but before they arrive, Tyler gives orders to fire a shot from the deck gun, which destroys the ship's radio room, preventing it from reporting the situation and revealing that the Allies have the Enigma. The submarine then dives beneath the German destroyer, which begins to drop depth charges. ''U-571's'' ''Kapit\u00e4nleutnant'' Wassner escapes captivity, and kills one of Tyler's crew, but he is subdued before he can sabotage the engines.\n\nTyler attempts to deceive the destroyer into stopping its attack, by ejecting debris and a dead crew member out of a torpedo tube, faking their own destruction. However, the destroyer continues to drop depth charges. ''U-571'' drops below {{convert|600|ft|m}}, and is damaged by high water pressure. They start to sink, and can only reverse this by ascending uncontrollably. Tyler orders crewman Trigger to submerge himself in the [[bilge]] under water to repressurize the single remaining torpedo tube.\n\nTrigger uses an air hose to breathe inside the flooded compartment. He closes the air valve to the stern tube, but finds a second leak, which he can't reach. The crew realizes that Wassner, despite being shackled, is using Morse Code to tap out a signal that the submarine had been captured, so Hirsch kills him. ''U-571'' surfaces heavily damaged and begins to flood, unable to fire its last torpedo. The pursuing destroyer fires with its main guns: the damage pins Trigger's legs when he is beyond reach of the air hose. Unable to turn back, he manages to close the valve just before he drowns. Tyler orders Tank to fire the torpedo; the destroyer is unable to take evasive action and is sunk. As the crew sighs in relief, Tank reports Trigger's death. However, the submarine has taken severe damage, and so the crew abandons it with the Enigma in their possession. They watch ''U-571'' as it slips beneath the waves once and for all. They are eventually spotted and rescued from their lifeboat by a US Navy [[PBY Catalina]] [[flying boat]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Lieutenant Andrew Tyler\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as Lieutenant Commander Mike Dahlgren\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as Chief Gunner's Mate Henry Klough\n* [[Jon Bon Jovi]] as Lieutenant Pete Emmett\n* [[David Keith (actor)|David Keith]] as Major Matthew Coonan\n* [[Jake Weber]] as Lieutenant Michael Hirsch\n* [[Jack Noseworthy]] as Seaman Bill Wentz\n* [[Tom Guiry]] as Seaman Ted \"Trigger\" Fitzgerald\n* [[Will Estes]] as Torpedoman Ronald \"Rabbit\" Parker\n* [[T.

The British [[Royal Navy]] had captured the first naval Enigma machine in May 1941, before the US had entered the war. The American portrayal offended many of the British military and public.

The U-boat was {{GS|U-110|1940|2}}. In 1942, the Royal Navy also seized {{GS|U-559||2}}, capturing additional Enigma codebooks.

An earlier military Enigma had been examined by [[Polish Intelligence]] in 1928; the [[Polish Cipher Bureau]] broke the Enigma code in 1932 and gave their findings to Britain and France in 1939, just before the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]].<ref name=\"channel4.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/e-h/film-u571.html |title=History |publisher=Channel 4 |access-date=March 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSub Lt.
