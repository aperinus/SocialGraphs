It stars [[Alison Lohman]], [[Justin Long]], [[Lorna Raver]], [[Dileep Rao]], [[David Paymer]], and [[Adriana Barraza]]. The plot, written with his older brother [[Ivan Raimi|Ivan]], focuses on a loan officer, who, because she has to prove to her boss that she can make the \"hard decisions\", chooses not to extend an elderly woman's mortgage. In retaliation, the woman places a [[curse]] on the loan officer that, after three days of escalating torment, will plunge her into the depths of [[Hell]] to burn for eternity.\n\nRaimi wrote ''Drag Me to Hell'' with his brother before working on the [[Spider-Man (2002 film series)|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]]. The film premiered at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and was a box office success, grossing over $90 million worldwide. ''Drag Me to Hell'' won the award for [[Saturn Award for Best Horror Film|Best Horror Film]] at the 2009 [[Scream Awards]] and the 2010 [[Saturn Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1969 [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], a Hispanic couple seek help from young medium Shaun San Dena, saying their son is ill and hears evil voices after stealing a silver necklace from a [[Gypsy]] wagon, despite trying to return it. San Dena prepares a s\u00e9ance, but an unseen force attacks them and drags the boy to Hell. San Dena vows to fight the demon again one day.\n\nIn present-day [[Los Angeles]], bank [[loan officer]] Christine Brown vies for a promotion to [[Branch manager|assistant branch manager]] with her co-worker Stu Rubin. Her boss, Jim Jacks, advises her to demonstrate tough decision-making. Sylvia Ganush, an elderly and disheveled European Roma woman, asks for a third extension on her mortgage. After Christine denies her request, Ganush cries and begs not to have her house repossessed. Security guards arrive and she leaves, angrily accusing Christine of shaming her. In the parking lot, Ganush ambushes and violently attacks Christine. After a long struggle, Ganush rips a button from Christine's coat and curses it. Later, Christine and her boyfriend Clay Dalton visit fortune teller Rham Jas, who tells Christine a dark spirit is haunting her. At home, the entity begins to violently attack Christine. At work, she hallucinates about Ganush and bleeds profusely from her nose while spewing blood on Jacks. As Christine leaves, Stu steals a file from her desk.\n\nChristine goes to beg Ganush for forgiveness but discovers she has recently died. After causing a scene at the funeral, a family member of Ganush warns her that she deserves everything she's about to get. Christine returns to Jas, who explains that as long as she owns the cursed button, a powerful demon known as the Lamia will torment her for three days before dragging her to Hell. He suggests a sacrifice may appease it. Christine reluctantly sacrifices her pet kitten before meeting Clay's parents at their house for dinner, where grotesque hallucinations torment her again.\nChristine returns to Jas, who requests a fee of $10,000. He introduces her to San Dena, who prepares a s\u00e9ance to trap Lamia in a goat and kill it. However, the Lamia possesses her and then her assistant, who vomits up the corpse of Christine's cat, saying it wants her soul. San Dena manages to successfully banish the Lamia from the s\u00e9ance, but dies afterwards.\n\nJas seals the button in an envelope and tells Christine that she can only remove the curse by giving the button to someone else. Christine considers giving the envelope to Stu but reconsiders. Instead, she digs up Ganush's grave and gives the corpse the envelope just at dawn. Christine returns home and prepares to meet Clay at Los Angeles Union Station for a weekend trip. Jacks notifies her of the promotion after Stu confessed to stealing her file and was fired.\n\nAt the station, Clay, hoping to propose to Christine, hands her the envelope with her missing button he found in his car, unaware of its significance. She realizes that she accidentally gave the wrong envelope to Ganush, which means the curse was never lifted. Horrified, Christine backs away and falls onto the tracks, just as fiery, demonic hands emerge. Clay tries to rescue Christine, but a train speeds through and he can only watch as the hands drag her to Hell.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Drag Me to Hell ComicCon panel.jpg|right|thumb|Director Sam Raimi and actors Dileep Rao, Alison Lohman, and Justin Long discussing the film at [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] in 2008]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Alison Lohman]] as Christine Brown\n* [[Justin Long]] as Professor Clayton \"Clay\" Dalton\n* [[Lorna Raver]] as Mrs. Sylvia Ganush\n* [[Dileep Rao]] as Rham Jas\n* [[David Paymer]] as Mr. Jim Jacks\n* [[Adriana Barraza]] as Shaun San Dena\n* [[Bojana Novakovic]] as Ilenka Ganush\n* [[Reggie Lee (actor)|Reggie Lee]] as Stu Rubin\n* [[Chelcie Ross]] as Leonard Dalton\n* [[Molly Cheek]] as Trudy Dalton\n* Art Kimbro as the voice of Lamia\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as a bank co-worker\n* [[Alex Veadov]] as the man with ponytail at the wake\n}}\nThe film includes [[cameo appearance]]s by Raimi himself as an uncredited ghost at the s\u00e9ance, his younger brother [[Ted Raimi|Ted]] as a doctor, and his eldest children Emma, Henry, and Lorne in minor roles.

Raver was not aware of the specific nature of her character until being cast, stating that all she had read was \"about a little old lady coming into the bank because they're closing down her house. It was only later that I saw the whole script and said, 'Oh my!'\".<ref name=\"prod\" /> To prepare for this role, Raver met with a Hungarian dialect coach and asked to have portions of the script translated into Hungarian.<ref name=\"prod\" /> Raimi would later ask Raver to use some of the Hungarian words in the scenes of Ganush's attacking Christine.<ref name=\"prod\" /> [[Dileep Rao]], who plays Rham Jas, made producer [[Grant Curtis]] mildly hesitant in casting him, stating that during his audition \"he was a little bit younger than he read in the script. But as we were looking at his reading, Sam said, 'There's no minimum age requirement on wisdom.' Dileep has that wisdom and presence on screen, and that's what made him right. Once he got on camera, he brought that shoulder for Alison to lean on.\"<ref name=\"prod\" /> Many of the actors playing secondary characters in ''Drag Me to Hell'' have appeared previously in Raimi's films, including Joanne Baron, Tom Carey, [[Molly Cheek]], Aimee Miles, John Paxton, [[Ted Raimi]], Bill E.

But I also wanted to have a lot of dark humor sprinkled throughout. I spent the last decade doing ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' and you come to rely on a lot of people doing things for you and a lot of help, but it's refreshing and wonderful to be reminded that, as with most filmmakers, the best way to do it is yourself, with a tight team doing the main jobs.\"<ref name=\"PostMag\">{{cite web | last = Blair | first = Iain | title = Director's Chair: Sam Raimi Drag me to Hell | url = http://www.postmagazine.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?tier=4&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&sid=&nm=&id=9A2AE6F97AE946859A3C884BDE603E22&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802031958/http://www.postmagazine.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&nm=&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&tier=4&id=9A2AE6F97AE946859A3C884BDE603E22 | archive-date=August 2, 2009 | work = Post Magazine | date = July 1, 2009 | access-date  = July 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nProduction for ''Drag Me to Hell'' began on location in [[Tarzana, Los Angeles|Tarzana, California]].<ref name=\"prod\" /> The production team included director of photography [[Peter Deming]], production designer Steve Saklad and visual effects supervisor Bruce Jones. The film was produced by [[Grant Curtis]] and [[Rob Tapert]]. Tapert and Raimi are longtime collaborators, having attended college together in Michigan.<ref name=\"PostMag\" />\n\n===Editing===\n''Drag Me to Hell'' was edited by [[Bob Murawski]], who has collaborated with Raimi on several films including the ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' series, ''[[The Gift (2000 film)|The Gift]]'', and ''[[Army of Darkness]]''.<ref name=\"PostMag\" /> Raimi has said of working with Murawski on ''Drag Me to Hell'', \"He'd come (down to the set) to see how things were going and to let me know if he'd just cut something that wasn't working the way he'd wanted it to, or to suggest a pick-up shot I should get for a piece he felt we needed in a sequence I hadn't realized I needed. He's very detail-oriented... So we're very close collaborators.\" Raimi finds editing with Murawski to be \"relaxing\", adding, \"I love it. For me, it's so relaxing, unlike pre-production, which is fraught with anxiety and fear about how we're going to do things, and production, which is so rushed and a sleepless time and you're just racing to finish every shot and worrying about focus and so on. So post is soothing and I can watch the film come together, so it's a time of discovery for me as Bob and I fit all the pieces together. I see new possibilities in post, as Bob puts the film together, sometimes in a way I never imagined...\"<ref name=\"PostMag\" /> The film was edited by Murawski on an Avid computer system in a West Los Angeles facility. The color grading was completed at Company 3 with colorist Stephen Nakamura. Nakamura used [[DaVinci Resolve]]. It was CO3's first start-to-finish feature in 4K resolution.<ref name=\"PostMag\" /> \"For us, post is a very creative time where it's not just about this factory producing the blueprinted product. It's really a very creative, experimental time where we try and take everything that's been written and then shot to the next level,\" said Raimi.<ref name=\"PostMag\" /> The final sound mix was completed at the Dub Stage in Burbank with mixers Marti Humphrey and Chris Jacobson.<ref name=\"PostMag\" />\n\n===Effects===\nThe effects in ''Drag Me to Hell'' were created in many different ways, including [[Chroma key|green screen]], [[puppet]]s, prosthetics and [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref name=\"prod\" /> Bruce Jones was the visual effects supervisor on the film. Of Jones, Raimi commented, \"He brought a great can-do approach to the film... He's got a great team of artists and technicians with him, and he's got great instincts.\"<ref name=\"PostMag\" />\n\nThere were hundreds of visual effects in the film, and different effects houses were utilized. According to Raimi, the [[Bay Area]]'s Tippett Studio was a big player. \"We also had work done by Amalgamated Pixels, Ghost VFX, KNB Effects, Home Digital, Cinesoup and IE Effects,\" said Raimi. According to Raimi, \"Bob (Murawski) and I kept adding visual effects as post proceeded. In this film, the supernatural, the unseen, is almost another character, so sequences were developed \u2014 even in post \u2014 that would suggest the presence of the supernatural, and we kept on adding. The same with the sound effects, so it was a very ongoing, very live process in post.\"<ref name=\"PostMag\" />\n\nDirector of photography [[Peter Deming]] tried to use realistic lighting in the film. Said Deming, \"Normally, you'd put all corrected bulbs in, but we went with what was there, including the shots in the street. We used the streetlight look and mixed that with interior lighting. There were a lot of odd color sources that we chose to leave the way they would be naturally. It's a heightened sense of realism.\"<ref name=\"prod\" /> One of the earliest projects the special effects teams did was the scene in which Mrs. Ganush attacks Christine in her car. To film the action, which included close-ups of Christine jamming her foot on the pedal, hitting the brake, and shifting gears, the team created a puzzle car which allowed the front engine compartment and back trunk \u2014 as well as all four sides and doors \u2014 to come away from the car. The roof came off in two directions.<ref name=\"prod\" />\n\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Drag Me to Hell\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Christopher Young]]\n| released   = August 18, 2009\n| genre      = [[Film score]]\n| length     = 52:27\n| producer   = Brian McNelis, Flavio Motalla, [[Skip Williamson (producer)|Skip Williamson]], [[Christopher Young]]<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1575235|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=November 24, 2009|title=Drag Me to Hell: Credits}}</ref>\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1=[[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score={{rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1575235|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=November 24, 2009|title=Drag Me to Hell: Overview}}</ref>\n|rev2=[[Soundtrack.Net]]\n|rev2score={{rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Drag Me to Hell|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/album/drag-me-to-hell/|publisher=[[Soundtrack.Net]]|access-date=9 March 2017}}</ref>\n}}\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[Christopher Young]].
