The film stars [[Karra Elejalde]] as H\u00e9ctor, a man who unwittingly becomes part of a [[causal loop]] and must stop his other selves from continuing to exist.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the Spanish countryside, a middle-aged man named H\u00e9ctor and his wife Clara live in a home that they are renovating. H\u00e9ctor scans the forest behind their house with binoculars and sees a young woman take off her T-shirt, exposing her breasts. When his wife goes shopping, he investigates and finds the woman on the ground, naked and unconscious. He is stabbed in the arm by a mysterious man with bloody bandages on his face. Fleeing and breaking into a mysterious nearby building, H\u00e9ctor contacts a scientist by [[walkie-talkie]], who warns him of the bandaged man and guides him to his location, promising safety. The scientist convinces H\u00e9ctor to hide from the bandaged man, who is just outside, in a large mechanical device. However, when he leaves the machine, H\u00e9ctor discovers that he has traveled approximately an hour back in time.\n\nThe scientist explains that the machine is an experimental [[Time travel|time travel device]], and refers to H\u00e9ctor as \"H\u00e9ctor 2\". The scientist tells him that they need to stay where they are and let events unfold. Despite the scientist's warning, H\u00e9ctor 2 drives off in a car, passing a cyclist, only to be run off the road by a van, cutting his head, which he wraps using the bandage from his arm wound. The bandage turns pink from absorbing the blood. The cyclist approaches to see if he is all right \u2013 it is the woman he earlier saw in the forest. He proceeds to replicate events by making her undress in view of H\u00e9ctor 1. When she runs away, he catches her, inadvertently knocking her out. He lays her out naked on the ground and then stabs Hector 1 in the arm when he arrives. The woman escapes. H\u00e9ctor 2 returns to his home, where he hears a scream and chases a woman through his house and onto the roof. When he attempts to grab her, she slips and falls to her death. Seeing the body from the roof, H\u00e9ctor 2 is horrified, believing he has killed his own wife.\n\nH\u00e9ctor contacts the scientist over a walkie-talkie and convinces him to lure H\u00e9ctor's past self to the lab with warnings that he is being pursued. Driving to the lab, H\u00e9ctor 2 insists that he must travel back one more time, despite the scientist revealing that there is a H\u00e9ctor 3, who told him he must stop H\u00e9ctor 2 from doing just that.\n\nAfter removing his bandages, H\u00e9ctor 2 convinces the scientist to send him back several seconds before he initially appears. He finds a van and runs H\u00e9ctor 2 off the road, but crashes as well, knocking himself out. Upon waking, he informs the scientist he has failed to stop H\u00e9ctor 2 by any means. He encounters the woman again, startling her into screaming, though she does not recognize him as her assailant. Since H\u00e9ctor 2 has heard her scream, H\u00e9ctor 3 and the woman flee to H\u00e9ctor's house. They become separated. H\u00e9ctor 3 finds and hides his wife, then realizes what has to happen / will happen / has already happened. He finds the woman, cuts her ponytail off, gives her his wife's coat, and tells her to hide upstairs. H\u00e9ctor 2 chases her onto the roof. H\u00e9ctor 3 sits on his lawn with his wife, as H\u00e9ctor 2 accidentally kills the woman, then drives off \u2013 heading back to the lab to become H\u00e9ctor 3. Emergency vehicles are heard approaching in the distance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Karra Elejalde]] as H\u00e9ctor\n* Candela Fern\u00e1ndez as Clara\n* [[Barbara Goenaga]] as the woman in the forest\n* [[Nacho Vigalondo]] as the scientist\n* Juan Inciarte as Occasional H\u00e9ctor\n\n==Inspiration==\nIn the documentary ''[[Future Shock! The Story of 2000 AD]]'' Nacho Vigalondo credits ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' comic magazine as the biggest influence on ''Timecrimes'', particularly the [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]] one-off \"Chronocops\" from #310 (1983).<ref>Goodwin, Paul (Director) (2014) ''[[Future Shock! The Story of 2000AD|Future Shock! The Story of 2000 AD]].'' London: Metrodome.</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe film's score was composed by [[Eugenio Mira]]. The film also uses the song \"[[Picture This (Blondie song)|Picture This]]\" by the American [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], which director Vigalondo has stated he chose because he \"love[s] the arrangement of the song and the chords. It's a happy song, but it's very sad and it's close to the movie\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/711605-excl-talking-timecrimes-with-nacho-vigalondo|title=EXCL: Talking Timecrimes With Nacho Vigalondo|date=20 November 2008|author=Ryan Turek|website=Comingsoon.net|access-date=20 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\nThe film premiered at [[Fantastic Fest]] in [[Austin, Texas]], on 20 September 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2007/09/fantastic-fest-2007-in-austin-texas-day-one.html|title=Fantastic Fest 2007 in Austin, Texas: Day One|website=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|date=21 September 2007|author=Tim Basham|access-date=18 May 2017}}</ref> It screened as the closing film of the [[Sitges Film Festival]] in October 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hoy.es/20071013/cultura/cronocrimenes-cierra-sitges-20071013.html|website=[[Hoy (Extremadura)|Hoy]]|title='Los cronocr\u00edmenes' cierra Sitges|date=13 October 2007|author=Boquerini}}</ref> It had a theatrical release in Spain on 27 June 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espinof.com/estrenos/estrenos-de-la-semana-27-de-junio-espanoles-y-poco-mas|website=Espinof|title=Estrenos de la semana {{!}} 27 de junio {{!}} Espa\u00f1oles y poco m\u00e1s|first=Juan Luis|last=Caviaro}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 87% based on {{nowrap|70 reviews}}, with a [[weighted average]] rating of 7/10.
