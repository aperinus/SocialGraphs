The film was panned by critics with [[List of films with a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|the rare 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes]]. The film grossed $4.4 million at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 1860s [[American frontier|Wild West]], a group of misfit [[settler]]s, including ex-doctor Phil Taylor, prostitute Belle, and [[homosexuality|gay]] bookseller Julian Rogers, decide they cannot live in their current situation in the west, so they hire a grizzled alcoholic wagon master by the name of James Harlow to take them on a journey back to their hometowns in the [[Eastern United States|East]].\n\nComedic exploits ensue as the drunken wagon master lets his horse choose the correct fork in the road, leads them to a dried out watering hole, and eventually guides them into [[Sioux]] territory where they are captured. The Chief, however, is sympathetic to the idea of 'white men heading back east', and offers an escort off Sioux land. Meanwhile, they must also contend with (inept) hired [[gunfighter|gunslinger]]s who have been sent by railroad magnates to stop the journey, as they fear the bad publicity it could create for the settlers about to commence a 'land rush' into the west.\n\nHarlow's secret, that he had been wagon master for the infamous [[Donner Party]], eventually comes out, and the group confront Harlow about his past; he chooses to walk away from the group and they proceed on their own. As he resumes his drinking at the closest tavern, he overhears that the [[cavalry]] will be confronting the group the following day, and intends to wipe them out, as directed by the head of the railroad company.\n\nAs the [[cavalry]] arrives the next day, and the group 'square their wagons', Harlow rides in to the rescue and 'calls out' the cavalry leader to single combat. After a drawn out and comical fight scene, Harlow is victorious, and the group celebrates. Harlow and Belle decide to pursue a relationship, Julian departs for somewhere 'even further west' (San Francisco) and the group rides toward the now visible St. Louis to finish the journey.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[John Candy]] as James Harlow\n* [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]] as Phil Taylor\n* [[John C.

Neff,'' which Candy was to star in with [[Sylvester Stallone]]. Despite his misgivings about the script, and due to the fact that he owed more than $1 million due to his stake as a minority owner with the [[Toronto Argonauts]] football team, Candy agreed to make ''Wagons East''  in [[Durango|Durango, Mexico]].<ref>Crane, Robert, (2017).
