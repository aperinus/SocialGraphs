It stars [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Warren Beatty]] (in his film debut) as two high school sweethearts, navigating feelings of sexual repression, love, and heartbreak. [[Pat Hingle]], [[Audrey Christie]], [[Barbara Loden]], [[Zohra Lampert]], and [[Joanna Roos]] are featured in supporting roles.\n\n''Splendor in the Grass'' was released theatrically on October 10, 1961, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] to critical and commercial success, grossing $4 million, and received two nominations at the [[34th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Wood) and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], winning the latter.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1928 [[Kansas]], teenagers Wilma Dean \"Deanie\" Loomis and her boyfriend, Bud Stamper, want a more physically intimate relationship, but heed the advice of their parents not to become more involved for the sake of Deanie's reputation and Bud's future plans for college. Bud's sister, Ginny, a [[flapper]], is more worldly having returned from Chicago after an annulment and rumors of an [[abortion]] to the disappointment and shame of Mr. and Mrs. Stamper. Bud rescues Ginny from an attempted rape at a New Year's Eve party, but disturbed by what he has seen, tells Deanie they should stop fooling around and they break up. \n\nBud has a liaison with Juanita. Shortly afterward, Deanie explodes in anger when her mother asks if she's still a virgin. Allen \"Toots\" Tuttle takes Deanie to a school dance where she sees Bud and tries to entice him into having sex. Bud rebuffs her and Deanie runs back to Toots, who drives her to a private spot. While there, Deanie realizes that she can't go through with sex, at which point she is almost raped. Escaping from Toots and driven close to madness, she attempts to commit suicide by jumping in the pond, but is rescued just before reaching the waterfalls. Her parents sell their oil stock to pay for her institutionalization, and fortuitously turn a profit prior to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Crash of 1929]] that leads to the [[Great Depression]].\n\nWhile Deanie is in the institution, she meets another patient, Johnny Masterson, who has anger issues targeted at his parents, who want him to be a surgeon. The two patients form a bond. Meanwhile, Bud is sent to [[Yale]], where he fails practically all his courses but meets Angelina, the daughter of Italian immigrants who run a local restaurant in [[New Haven]]. In October 1929, Bud's father travels to New Haven in an attempt to persuade the dean not to expel Bud from school; Bud tells the dean he only aspires to own a ranch. The stock market crashes while Ace is in New Haven and he loses everything. He takes Bud to New York for a weekend, including to a cabaret nightclub, then commits suicide by jumping from a building \u2013 something he had been joking about just a short time earlier \u2013 and Bud must identify the body.\n\nDeanie returns home from the [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]] after two years and six months, \"almost to the day.\" Ace's widow has gone to live with relatives, and Bud's sister has died in a car crash. Deanie's mother wants to shield her from any potential anguish from meeting Bud, so she pretends to not know where he is. When Deanie's friends from high school come over, her mother gets them to agree to feign ignorance on Bud's whereabouts. However, Deanie's father refuses to coddle his daughter and tells her that Bud has taken up ranching and lives on the old family farm. Her friends drive Deanie to meet Bud, at an old farmhouse. He is now dressed in plain clothes and married to Angelina; they have an infant son named Bud Jr. and another child on the way. Deanie lets Bud know that she is going to marry John (who is now a doctor in [[Cincinnati]]). During their brief reunion, Deanie and Bud realize that both must accept what life has thrown at them. Bud says, \"What's the point? You gotta take what comes.\" They each relate that they \"don't think about happiness very much anymore.\"<ref name=filmsite>{{cite web |url= http://www.filmsite.org/sple.html |title= filmsite \u2013 Splendor in the Grass}}</ref>\n\nAs Deanie leaves with her friends, Bud only seems partially satisfied by the direction his life has taken. After the others are gone, he reassures Angelina, who has realized that Deanie was once the love of his life.<ref name=filmsite /> Driving away, Deanie's friends ask her if she is still in love with Bud. She does not answer them, but her voice is heard reciting four lines from [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]]'s \"[[Ode: Intimations of Immortality|Intimations of Immortality]]\": \n:\"Though nothing can bring back the hour \n:Of splendor in the grass, glory in the flower \n:We will grieve not; rather find  \n:Strength in what remains behind.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Natalie Wood]] as Wilma Dean \"Deanie\" Loomis\n*[[Pat Hingle]] as Ace Stamper\n*[[Audrey Christie]] as Mrs. Loomis\n*[[Barbara Loden]] as Virginia \"Ginny\" Stamper\n*[[Zohra Lampert]] as Angelina\n*[[Warren Beatty]] as Bud Stamper\n*Fred Stewart as Del Loomis\n*[[Joanna Roos]] as Mrs. Stamper\n*John McGovern as Doc Smiley\n*Jan Norris as Juanita Howard\n*[[Martine Bartlett]] as Miss Metcalf\n*[[Gary Lockwood]] as Allen \"Toots\" Tuttle\n*[[Sandy Dennis]] as Kay\n*[[Crystal Field]] as Hazel\n*[[Marla Adams]] as June\n*[[Lynn Loring]] as Carolyn\n*[[Phyllis Diller]] as [[Texas Guinan]]\n*[[Sean Garrison]] as Glenn\n}}\n\n'''Uncredited''' (in order of appearance)\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Ivor Francis]] as Dr. Judd\n*[[Mark Slade]] as Rusty\n*[[Godfrey Cambridge]] as Chauffeur\n*[[Buster Bailey]] as Musician at party\n*[[Lou Antonio]] as Oil field worker at party\n*[[William Inge]] as Reverend Whitman\n*[[Eugene Roche]] as Private detective\n*[[Charles Robinson (actor, born 1932)|Charles Robinson]] as Johnny Masterson\n}}\n\n==Production==\nFilmed in New York City at [[Filmways Studios]], ''Splendor in the Grass'' is based on people whom screenwriter [[William Inge]] knew while growing up in Kansas in the 1920s. He told the story to director [[Elia Kazan]] when they were working on a production of Inge's play ''[[The Dark at the Top of the Stairs]]'' in 1957. They agreed that it would make a good film and that they wanted to work together on it. Inge wrote it first as a novel, then as a screenplay.\n\nThe film's title is taken from a line of [[William Wordsworth]]'s poem \"[[Ode: Intimations of Immortality|Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood]]\":\n:What though the radiance which was once so bright\n:Be now for ever taken from my sight,\n:Though nothing can bring back the hour\n:Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;\n:We will grieve not, rather find\n:Strength in what remains behind...\n\nTwo years before writing the screenplay for the film, Inge wrote ''Glory in the Flower'' (1953), a stage play whose title comes from the same line of the [[Wordsworth]] poem. The play relates the story of two middle-aged, former lovers who meet again briefly at a diner after a long estrangement; they are essentially the same characters as Bud and Deanie, though the names are Bus and Jackie.\n\nScenes of Kansas and the Loomis home were shot in the [[Travis, Staten Island|Travis section of Staten Island]], New York City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forgotten-ny.com/2006/03/travis-staten-island/ |title=TRAVIS, Staten Island |website=Forgotten New York|date=March 11, 2006 }}</ref> Exterior scenes of the high school campus were shot at [[Horace Mann School]] in the Bronx.

There is poetry in her performance, and her eyes in the final scene bespeak the moral significance and emotional fulfillment of this film.\"\n\nWriting in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine, however, [[Dwight Macdonald]] confirmed the notion that Elia Kazan was \"as vulgar a director as has come along since [[Cecil B. De Mille]].\" He further commented:\n\n{{blockquote|I've never been in Kansas, but I suspect that parents there even way back in 1928 were not stupid to the point of villainy and that their children were not sexually frustrated to the point of lunacy...Kazan is \"forthright\" the way a butcher is forthright when he slaps down a steak for the customer's inspection. [He] won't give up anything that can be exploited.<ref>Macdonald, Dwight. ''On Movies.'' Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1969. pp. 141\u2013142.</ref>}}\n\nAs for the performances, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated that Wood and Beatty \"deliver convincing, appealing performances\" and Christie and Hingle were \"truly exceptional,\" but also found \"something awkward about the picture's mechanical rhythm. There are missing links and blind alleys within the story. Several times it segues abruptly from a climax to a point much later in time at which is encountered revelations and eventualities the auditor cannot take for granted. Too much time is spent focusing attention on characters of minor significance in themselves.\"<ref>\"Film Reviews: Splendor In The Grass\". ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.

Scheuer of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, \"The picture does have its theatrical excesses and falls short idealistically in that its morality remains unresolved; nevertheless, it is film-making of the first order and one of the few significant American dramas we have had this year.\"<ref>Scheuer, Philip K.

The emotional cheapness and the sordid crudeness that are evidencing themselves in so many of the yarns being spun, these days, out of the sexual pattern of young, immoral behavior is not to be found here. Instead, you find a poignantly appealing and warmly touching performance of lovely Natalie Wood that gives the story meaning.\"<ref>\"'Splendor in the Grass' film review\". ''[[Harrison's Reports]]''. September 2, 1961. p. 138.</ref>  [[Brendan Gill]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' disagreed and slammed the film for being \"as phony a picture as I can remember seeing,\" explaining that Inge and Kazan \"must know perfectly well that the young people whom they cause to go thrashing about in 'Splendor in the Grass' bear practically no relation to young people in real life ... one has no choice but to suppose that this unwholesome sally into adolescent sexology was devised neither to instruct our minds nor to move our hearts but to arouse a prurient interest and produce a box-office smasheroo. I can't help hoping they have overplayed their hand.\"<ref>Gill, Brendan (October 14, 1961). \"The Current Cinema\". ''[[The New Yorker]]''. 176.</ref>\n\n''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine said \"the script, on the whole, is the weakest element of the picture, but scriptwriter Inge can hardly be blamed for it\" because it had been \"heavily edited\" by Kazan; he called the film a \"relatively simple story of adolescent love and frustration\" that has been \"jargoned-up and chaptered-out till it sounds like an angry psychosociological [[monograph]] describing the sexual [[mores]] of the heartless heartland.\"<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,939285,00.html | archive-url= https://archive.today/20130204191354/http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,939285,00.html | url-status= dead | archive-date= February 4, 2013 | title= Cinema: Love in Kazansas | date= October 13, 1961| publisher= Time | access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe film holds a score of 75% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 24 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/splendor_in_the_grass |title=Splendor in the Grass |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=May 26, 2022 }}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

Blume's Deenie goes on to explain that it took her almost 13 years to find out that the girl in the movie went crazy and \"ended up on the funny farm,\" and that her mother advised her to forget that part of the story.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1961]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{commons category|Splendor in the Grass (1961 film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|0055471}}\n* {{amg movie|46146}}\n* {{tcmdb title|16108}}\n* {{AFI film|19329}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|splendor_in_the_grass}}\n\n{{Elia Kazan}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Splendor In The Grass}}\n[[Category:1961 films]]\n[[Category:1961 drama films]]\n[[Category:1960s coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:1960s romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:1960s teen drama films]]\n[[Category:1960s teen romance films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American teen drama films]]\n[[Category:American teen romance films]]\n[[Category:Coming-of-age romance films]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about bipolar disorder]]\n[[Category:Films about dysfunctional families]]\n[[Category:Films about sexual repression]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Elia Kazan]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Amram]]\n[[Category:Films set in Kansas]]\n[[Category:Films set in psychiatric hospitals]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1928]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1929]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1930]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1920s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1930s]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Films whose writer won the Best Original Screenplay Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Juvenile sexuality in films]]\n[[Category:Photoplay Awards film of the year winners]]\n[[Category:1960s American films]]"}]}}}}
