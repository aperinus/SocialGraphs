The film tells the story of Irena Dubrovna, a newly married Serbian fashion illustrator obsessed with the idea that she is descended from an ancient tribe of Cat People who metamorphose into black panthers when aroused. When her husband begins to show interest in one of his coworkers, Irena begins to stalk her. The film stars [[Simone Simon]] as Irena, and features [[Kent Smith]], [[Tom Conway]], and [[Jane Randolph]] in supporting roles.\n\nProduction began in 1942, with Lewton being placed in charge of developing RKO's low-budget horror films. He brought together a team of filmmakers that he had worked with in the past, including Tourneur, editor [[Mark Robson (film director)|Mark Robson]] and screenwriter [[DeWitt Bodeen]]. ''Cat People'' was the first film upon which the team worked. They were given the title by an RKO executive, who instructed them to develop a film from it. After researching various horror films and cat-related literature, Bodeen and Lewton developed the script with Lewton doing extensive uncredited work on the story. The film was shot at RKO's studios reusing sets from previous films such as ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]''. During editing, Robson developed a technique later called The Lewton Bus, a [[jump scare]] that Lewton used in his subsequent films.\n\n''Cat People'' had its premiere at the [[Rialto Theatre (New York City)|Rialto Theatre]] in [[Manhattan]] on December 5, 1942, before having a wider release on December 25. Initial critical reviews ranged from negative to mildly enthusiastic. The film did well in the box office, being one of RKO's biggest hits of the season. Several horror films of the 1940s and 1950s were influenced by ''Cat People'', either drawing on the film's shadowy visuals or containing a female character who fears that she possesses a hereditary trait that makes her transform into a monster. The film was followed by a sequel, ''[[The Curse of the Cat People]]'', in 1944, and [[Cat People (1982 film)|a remake]], directed by [[Paul Schrader]], was released in 1982. The film has become well known, though created as a [[B-movie]], being selected by [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the  [[National Film Registry]] in 1993. Retrospective reception of the original has been varied. Some modern critics have described the film as being too subdued for the genre and have deprecated the quality of the acting. Others have praised the film's atmosphere and sophistication, with the critic [[Roger Ebert]] describing it and the other Val Lewton productions as landmark films of the 1940s.\n\n==Plot==\nAt the [[Central Park Zoo]] in [[New York City]], [[Serbia]]n-born fashion illustrator Irena Dubrovna ([[Simone Simon]]) makes sketches of a [[black panther]]. She catches the attention of [[Marine engineering|marine engineer]] Oliver Reed ([[Kent Smith]]), who strikes up a conversation. Irena invites him to her apartment for tea. At her apartment, Oliver is intrigued by a statue of a medieval warrior on horseback impaling a large cat with his sword. Irena informs Oliver that the figure is [[Emperor Jovan Nenad|King John of Serbia]] and that the cat represents evil. According to legend, long ago, the Christian residents of her home village gradually turned to [[witchcraft]] and devil worship after being enslaved by the [[Mamluk|Mameluks]]. When King John drove the Mameluks out and saw what the villagers had become, he had them killed. However, \"the wisest and the most wicked\" escaped into the mountains. Oliver is dismissive of the legend even though Irena clearly takes it seriously.\n\nOliver buys her a kitten, but upon meeting her, it hisses. Irena suggests they go to the pet shop to exchange it. When they enter the shop, the animals go wild in her presence, and Irena becomes uneasy. Irena gradually reveals to Oliver that she believes she is descended from the cat people of her village, and that she will transform into a panther if aroused to passion. Despite this, Oliver asks her to marry him, and she agrees. During the dinner after their wedding at The Belgrade, a Serbian restaurant, a cat-like woman walks over and addresses Irena as ''moya sestra'' (\"my sister\"). Irena never consummates the marriage, fearful of the consequences. Oliver is patient with her, but eventually persuades her to see a psychiatrist, Dr. Louis Judd ([[Tom Conway]]). Judd tries to convince her that her fears stem from childhood traumas.  Meanwhile, Irena is unhappy to discover that Oliver has confided in his assistant, Alice Moore ([[Jane Randolph]]). Alice confesses to Oliver that she loves him. When Irena chances to see Oliver and Alice seated together at a restaurant, she follows Alice home. Just as Alice hears a menacing sound, a bus pulls up and she boards it. Soon after, a groundskeeper discovers several freshly killed sheep. The paw prints leading away turn into imprints of a woman's shoes. Irena returns to her apartment looking dishevelled and exhausted; she is shown shortly afterwards weeping in the bathtub. Irena dreams of Dr. Judd dressed up as King John speaking of \"the key\". She later steals the key to the panther's cage in Central Park.\n\nIrena, Oliver and Alice visit a museum, and Irena is angered when the two virtually ignore her. That evening, when Alice decides to use the basement swimming pool of her apartment building, she is stalked by an animal. When Alice screams for help, Irena appears, turning on the lights, and says she is looking for Oliver. Alice later finds her bathrobe torn to shreds. After an appointment with Dr. Judd, Irena tells Oliver that she is no longer afraid, but Oliver tells her it is too late: he has realized that he loves Alice and intends to divorce Irena. Later at work, Oliver and Alice are cornered by a snarling animal. Oliver and Alice manage to get out of the building but not before smelling Irena's [[perfume]]. Alice calls Judd to warn him to stay away from Irena, but he hangs up when Irena arrives for her appointment with him. He kisses Irena passionately, resulting in her transformation into a panther who attacks and kills him. When Oliver and Alice arrive at Judd's office, Irena slips away and goes to the zoo. There, she opens the panther's cage with the stolen key and is struck down by the escaping panther, which is accidentally run down and killed by a car. Next to the panther's cage, Oliver and Alice find a dead panther lying on the ground. Oliver says, \"She never lied to us\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Simone Simon]] as Irena Dubrovna\n* [[Kent Smith]] as Oliver Reed\n* [[Tom Conway]] as Dr. Louis Judd\n* [[Jane Randolph]] as Alice Moore\n* [[Jack Holt (actor)|Jack Holt]] as 'Commodore' C.

Selznick]] to work for [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]]' [[Charles Koerner]], becoming the head of a new unit created to develop [[B-movie]] horror feature films.{{sfn|Fujiwara|2000|p=72}}{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=7}} Writing in 2009, the film critic [[Kim Newman]] compared the Lewton productions to RKO's own B-movie mystery series based on [[The Falcon (film character)|The Falcon]], which were, unlike Lewton's productions, \"churned out\".{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=7}} The Lewton productions were modestly budgeted compared to [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s 1941 film ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]'s 1944 film ''[[The Uninvited (1944 film)|The Uninvited]]'', but had larger budgets than those for [[Producers Releasing Corporation]] (PRC) film ''[[The Mad Monster]]'' (1942) or [[Monogram Studios|Monogram]]'s ''[[The Ape Man]]'' (1943).{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=7}} ''Cat People'' had a budget of around $135,000.{{sfn|Jacobs|2011|p=297}}{{sfn|Mank|2005|p=140}} This was significantly smaller than Universal had for 1943's ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' but more than the $97,000 that the [[poverty row]] studio PRC spent on the 1940 film ''[[The Devil Bat]]''.{{sfn|Mank|2014|p=222}}\n\nLewton selected most of the film's main crew, including director [[Jacques Tourneur]] and writer [[DeWitt Bodeen]], who all worked on the [[Film treatment|treatment]].{{sfn|Fujiwara|2000|p=72}} These were people Lewton had connections with through their work with Selznick, as Tourneur had worked as part of the [[second unit]] teams for Selnick's production of ''[[A Tale of Two Cities (1935 film)|A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (1935) and Bodeen had been a research assistant on what would become ''[[Jane Eyre (1943 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' (1943). Tourneur and Bodeen offered conflicting accounts as to how ''Cat People'' was conceived. Tourneur said that Lewton called him from RKO to direct the film after Koerner attended a party where it was suggested to him that he develop a film with the title ''Cat People''. Tourneur added that Lewton was not sure what to do with the title and recalled Lewton deciding to not make a \"cheap horror movie that the studio expected but something intelligent and in good taste\".{{sfn|Newman|2009|pp=8\u20139}} Bodeen's version involved him being hired by Lewton at RKO as a contract writer. He had previously watched British and American horror and suspense films that he felt were \"typical of what we did not want to do\".{{sfn|Newman|2009|pp=8\u20139}} According to Bodeen, Koerner felt that werewolves, vampires and man-made monsters were over-exploited, and that \"nobody has done much with cats\". Bodeen added that Lewton was unhappy with the proposed title of ''Cat People'' and said, \"if you want to get out now, I won't hold it against you\".{{sfn|Newman|2009|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nBodeen then began researching cat-related literature, including [[Ambrose Bierce]]'s \"[[The Eyes of the Panther]]\" and [[Margaret Irwin (novelist)|Margaret Irwin]]'s \"Monsieur Seeks a Wife\". Lewton decided to base the film on [[Algernon Blackwood]]'s 1906 short story \"Ancient Sorceries\".{{sfn|Newman|2009|pp=9\u201310, 74}} Blackwood's story had a contemporary setting and involved a [[Medieval architecture]] French town inhabited by a group of devil-worshipping cat people.{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=10}} According to Bodeen, as the rights were about to be purchased, Lewton changed his mind at the last minute and told Bodeen that the film would be set in contemporary New York and involve a love triangle between a man, a foreign woman obsessed with abnormal fears, and a female office worker.{{sfn|Newman|2009|pp=9\u201310}} According to Tourneur, he was not content with the period setting of \"Ancient Sorceries\", stating, \"if you're going to have horror, the audience must be able to identify with the characters in order to be frightened\".{{sfn|Fujiwara|2000|p=72}}{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=10}} Lewton contributed heavily to the screenplay. During the writing process, Tourneur recalled driving by Lewton's home in the evening to find a light turned on where Lewton was still working on the screenplay. Bodeen described the screenplay as a \"group project\", saying Lewton had the original idea and wrote the treatment and screenplay, collaborating with Tourneur and Lewton, and later the film's editor [[Mark Robson (film director)|Mark Robson]]. Bodeen concluded that \"Tourneur was entirely responsible for the style of ''Cat People'', but if you read the screenplay you would find everything in the film was in the original script \u2013 and that's simply because it was a group project. Val, Tourneur, myself, Robson \u2013 we all talked about it and I put it down on paper\".{{sfn|Newman|2009|pp=15\u201316}} By May 1, 1942, Bodeen had a fifty-page treatment completed for ''Cat People''.{{sfn|Mank|2014|p=218}}\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[File:Simone Simon Cat People promotional photo.jpg|thumb|309x309px|[[Simone Simon]] in a 1942 promotional photo for ''Cat People''.]]\n<!-- pre-production: recruitment of the most important artists (cast and crew) and shooting preparations -->\nSimone Simon was cast in the role of Irena Dubrovna by producer Lewton.{{sfn|Mank|2005|p=116}} Lewton commented that, \"I'd like to have a girl with a little kitten face like Simone Simon, cute and soft and cuddly and seemingly not at all dangerous\".{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=11}} He compared his decision to the casting of [[Kathleen Burke]] in ''[[Island of Lost Souls (1932 film)|Island of Lost Souls]]'' (1932), where she portrayed the Panther Woman, stating that any attempt at securing a wild, cat-like appearance in their casting would be disastrous.{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=11}} Simon, a star in her native France, had recently garnered fame in the United States for her role in ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster (film)|The Devil and Daniel Webster]]'' (1941).{{sfn|Mank|2005|p=116}} Opposite Simon, Kent Smith was cast as Oliver Reed.{{sfn|Mank|2005|p=139}} Smith allegedly received the role after Lewton spotted him cycling across the studio lot.{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=19}}\n\nThe ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported in August 1942 that [[Jack Holt (actor)|Jack Holt]] had been cast in a supporting role, following Simon's casting as the lead.{{sfn|Schallert|1942|p=15}} Tom Conway was cast as Dr. Judd, a psychiatrist who evaluates Irena and initially believes her fears to be delusional.{{sfn|Fujiwara|2000|p=73}} Jane Randolph, then a young actress who had recently begun her film career, was cast as Alice Moore, a woman vying for Oliver's affections.{{sfn|Mank|2005|p=139}} Lewton had wanted [[Jennifer Jones]] to play Alice, but was prevented from casting her by Selznick, who had other plans for Jones.{{sfn|Mank|2014|p=222}} Among the rest of the crew was the composer of the score [[Roy Webb]] and cinematographer [[Nicholas Musuraca]], who were seasoned veterans at RKO.{{sfn|Jones|2016|loc=00:14:01}}\n\n===Filming===\n<!-- production or filming: actual filming\u2014dates and places, important artistic decisions, and noteworthy events (delays, reshoots, financial problems, etc.) -->\n[[Principal photography]] commenced on July 28, 1942, at RKO's [[Gower Gulch]] studios in Hollywood.{{sfn|Mank|2005|pp=139\u2013140}} Tourneur recalled that he was nearly fired three days into shooting after executive producer Lew Ostrow saw the daily [[Dailies|rushes]], called Lewton and told him to fire the director. According to Tourneur, Lewton subsequently contacted Koerner, who viewed the raw unedited footage of the film the following day and expressed satisfaction with Tourneur's performance.{{sfn|Newman|2009|pp=13\u201314}} Simon frequently clashed with co-stars as well as Tourneur during the shoot and displayed a significant temper.{{sfn|Mank|2005|pages=139\u2013140}} Randolph recalled that Simon frequently upstaged her during their scenes together, to the point that Tourneur confronted Simon: \"He really bawled her out\u2014in French.

The director finished this scene by shooting it in a way that \"you couldn't really be sure what you were seeing. That's the only way to do it\".{{sfn|Newman|2009|pp=42, 57}}\n\nSome of the film sets were re-used from previous productions, such as the hallway and staircase in Dubrovna's apartment, which were from ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]''.{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=19}} Other sets were re-used from ''[[The Devil and Miss Jones]]''.{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=25}} Additional photography took place at the Royal Palms Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, where the swimming pool sequence involving a character believing she is stalked by a panther was shot. The location was chosen by the production team due to its claustrophobic atmosphere.{{sfn|Mank|2005|p=140}} Bodeen also stated that the scene was inspired by his own experience of nearly drowning when swimming alone at night in a pool while Tourneur said that the scene was based on his own experience of swimming alone in a friend's pool while the friend's pet cheetah escaped and began pacing nearby.{{sfn|Fujiwara|2000|p=72}} Filming was concluded on August 21.

He adds, \"there's a sense of life in her performance that makes ''Cat People'', like most great monster movies, as much as a tragedy as a melodrama\".{{sfn|Newman|2009|pp=72\u201373}}\n\nNewman praises the film, noting that it was the first major supernatural horror film with a contemporary urban, American setting with \"normal people, engaged in normal occupations\" as leading characters. He concludes that ''Cat People'' was a progenitor of films like ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]''.{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=65}} Newman writes that through numerous viewings of the film, he discovered \"new aspect[s], some unnoticed detail carefully crafted [...] I would happily rewatch it this evening which may be the highest praise I can give any film\".{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=73}} In his book on Tourneur, Fujiwara declared that ''Cat People'' was the \"master text\" of Tourneur's career, stating that most of his later films have some connection with ''Cat People'', specifically ''The Leopard Man'' and ''[[Night of the Demon]]'' but also ''[[Experiment Perilous]]'', ''[[Out of the Past]]'', ''[[Nightfall (1957 film)|Nightfall]]'' and ''[[Circle of Danger]]''. Fujiwara concluded that ''Cat People'' is \"with all its flaws, a perfect film\". He added that even its flaws \"have become classic\", dismissing the \"careful\", \"tepid\", \"strained\" and \"uneven\" qualities that some critics have complained about. Fujiwara states that ''Cat People'' \"is still contagious; the viewer can still share the surprise and pleasure the film evoked in audiences who discovered this unheralded B horror film on its initial release\".{{sfn|Fujiwara|2000|pp=83\u201384}} Critic [[Roger Ebert]] included ''Cat People'' in his list of \"Great Movies\" in 2006.{{sfn|Ebert|2006}} He remarked that the film would work for contemporary audiences depending on their tastes, stating that the film was \"frightening in an eerie, mysterious way that was hard to define\" with \"an undertone of sexual danger that was more ominous because it was never acted upon\".{{sfn|Ebert|2006}} Ebert also praised the filmmakers, writing that Tourneur and Musuraca were \"masters of light and shadow\". Ebert added that the films Lewton produced in the 1940s were \"landmark[s] in American movie history\".{{sfn|Ebert|2006}} In 1993, the [[Library of Congress]] selected ''Cat People'' for preservation in the  [[National Film Registry]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web | title =Films Selected to The National Film Registry, Library of Congress 1989-2007 | publisher =Library of Congress | url =https://www.loc.gov/film/titles.html | access-date=May 5, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n===Sequels===\nOn discussing the history of horror films, Newman states that if a horror film in the 1940s was financially successful, it was likely to become a franchise. ''Cat People'' was followed by ''[[The Curse of the Cat People]]'', directed by [[Robert Wise]], which follows Oliver Reed's daughter Amy and her [[invisible friend]], portrayed by Simon. Lewton had unsuccessfully attempted to have the film's title changed to ''Amy and Her Friend''. Other actors from ''Cat People'' appear in the film in different roles, such as Russell, who plays Barbara Farren.{{sfn|Newman|1999|pp=20\u201321}}\n\n''[[The Seventh Victim]]'' is described by Newman as being \"an unacknowledged spin-off\" of ''Cat People'', as it features Tom Conway's character returning as Dr. Judd, as well as another haunted woman eager to embrace death.{{sfn|Newman|1999|p=20}} In the film, Judd recalls that he once knew a mysterious woman who was in fact a \"raving lunatic\", even though Judd's character died in ''Cat People'', making the relationship between the two fictional narratives incoherent.{{sfn|Christopher|2010|pp=216\u2013218}} In memos and early drafts of the screenplay, Conway's character was referred to as \"Mr. Siegfried\", leading film scholars to believe that the character's name was changed to create continuity between the two films and capitalize on ''Cat People''{{'}}s success.{{sfn|Snelson|2014|p=179}}\n\n===Remakes===\n{{Further|Cat People (1982 film)}}\nBritish producer [[Milton Subotsky]] bought the rights to ''Cat People'' from RKO with plans to develop a remake.{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=70}} Subotsky later passed the property to Universal who were going to originally have [[Roger Vadim]] direct the remake.{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=70}}<ref name=\"SchraderAFI\">{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/68109-CAT-PEOPLE?sid=14df3907-14d5-4efb-afad-96913e3b1000&sr=10.170605&cp=1&pos=1|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|title=Cat People (1982)|access-date=April 30, 2020}}</ref>{{sfn|Warren|1982|pp=32\u201333}} Three drafts for the screenplay were developed with the first two written by [[Bob Clark]] and the final chosen screenplay written by [[Alan Ormsby]].

Bailey recalled that the two carefully studied the original scene, taking note of how the shadows reflected against the pool.{{sfn|Bailey|2016|loc=00:14:10}} Bailey stated that the pool sequence was the most similar of the homages, remarking that the primary reason for this was that \"we didn't think we could do it any better\".{{sfn|Bailey|2016|loc=00:15:54}} The film was released in April 1982 to mixed reviews.<ref name=\"SchraderAFI\" />\n\nIn March 1999, a second remake was announced as a co-production between Universal Pictures and Overbrook Entertainment.

In 1944, [[Columbia Pictures]] released ''[[Cry of the Werewolf]]'', which Newman describes as combining the \"subtle Lewton approach\" with elements from Universal's ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' such as a plot that involves a gypsy curse. Several other films borrow plot elements from ''Cat People'', specifically they either feature a female character who fears that she has inherited the tendency to turn into a monster or attempt to replicate the shadowy visual style of Tourneur and Musuraca.{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=69}} These include ''[[Jungle Woman]]'', ''[[The Soul of a Monster]]'', ''[[The Woman Who Came Back]]'', ''[[She-Wolf of London (film)|She-Wolf of London]]'', ''[[The Catman of Paris]]'', ''[[The Cat Creeps (1946 film)|The Cat Creeps]]'', ''[[Cult of the Cobra]]'', ''[[Daughter of Dr. Jekyll]]'', ''[[The Creeper (film)|The Creeper]]'' and ''[[The She-Creature]]''.{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=69}}\n\nDirector [[Curtis Harrington]] made two films as a tribute to Lewton's work.{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=19}} The first was ''[[Night Tide]]'', which reworks ''Cat People''{{'}}s plot into a story about a side show performer who dresses as a mermaid and is concerned that she actually is a [[Siren (mythology)|siren]].{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=68}} Harrington also paid tribute to Lewton's work and Universal's horror films with his television film ''[[The Cat Creature]]'', which featured Kent Smith as part of its cast.{{sfn|Newman|2009|pp=19, 69\u201370}}\n\nThe film would later also be referenced in Argentine author [[Manuel Puig]]'s 1976 novel [[Kiss of the Spider Woman (novel)|El beso de la mujer ara\u00f1a]], in which Cat People is one of a number of American films recounted by two Argentine prisoners under the 1970s [[National Reorganization Process|junta]] in an effort to pass the time.<ref>{{Cite book |first=MANUEL |last=PUIG |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1267384152 |title=KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN. |date=2022 |publisher=VINTAGE CLASSICS |isbn=1-78487-778-6 |oclc=1267384152}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite AV media\n | year=2016\n | last=Bailey\n | first= John\n | title = Cat People\n | chapter = John Bailey on ''Cat People''\n | medium = Blu-ray\n | publisher = [[The Criterion Collection]]\n | id = CC2674BD\n | ISBN=978-1-68143-201-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bansak|first=Edmund G.|title=Fearing the Dark: The Val Lewton Career|year=2003|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786417099|orig-year=1st pub. 1995}}\n*{{cite book|last=Christopher|first=Nicholas|year=2010|title=Somewhere in the Night|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4391-3761-1}}\n* {{cite magazine|title=Cat People|volume=48|issue=564|year=1981|publisher=British Film Institute|magazine=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|last=Combs|first=Richard}}\n* {{cite web|title= 'Cat People', With Simone Simon and Jack Holt, at Rialto -- New Swedish Film at 48th Street;
