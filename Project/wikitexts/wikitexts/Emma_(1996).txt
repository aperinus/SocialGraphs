It was adapted for the British television network [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1996, directed by [[Diarmuid Lawrence]] and dramatised by [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]], the same year as [[Miramax]]'s film adaptation of ''[[Emma (1996 theatrical film)|Emma]]'' starring [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]. This production of ''Emma'' stars [[Kate Beckinsale]] as the title character, and also features [[Samantha Morton]] as Harriet Smith and [[Mark Strong]] as Mr. Knightley.\n\nDavies had recently adapted another Austen novel as the successful 1995 television serial ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV series)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' for the [[BBC]] when he proposed to adapt the novel ''Emma'' for the network. The BBC, however, had already made such an agreement with another screenwriter, leading Davies to approach ITV.\n\n''Emma'' received generally positive reviews from critics, who believed it to be superior to the 1996 Miramax film. Most focused on Beckinsale's performance as a positive highlight. It aired on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] on 24 November 1996 and garnered an estimated 12 million viewers. It also was broadcast on the American channel [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] on 16 February 1997.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{See also|Emma (novel)#Plot summary}}\n\nMiss [[Emma Woodhouse]] ([[Kate Beckinsale]]) of Hartfield lives in the small town of Highbury, and is young, pretty, and rich. Though she has decided she will never marry, Emma takes credit for matchmaking her friend and former governess, Miss Taylor, to the widower Mr. Weston. Emma decides to organize marriages for others of her acquaintance, despite friendly warnings not to meddle from Mr. Knightley, who is both an old friend, her brother-in-law, and the wealthy owner of Donwell Abbey. Emma resolves to marry her new friend, a pretty orphan named Harriet Smith, to the young vicar, Mr. Elton. This fails once Emma realizes to her horror that Elton desires to marry her instead.\n\nNew arrivals come to Highbury, including young orphan Miss Fairfax and Elton's new pretentious wife. Frank Churchill, the handsome son of Mr. Weston, also arrives generating interest and gossip. Emma, so sure of her ability to judge the feelings of others, believes that Frank wishes to marry her. Eventually the town discovers that Frank and Miss Fairfax have been secretly engaged, while Emma comes to recognize her true feelings for Mr. Knightley.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Kate Beckinsale]] as [[Emma Woodhouse]]\n* [[Bernard Hepton]] as Mr. Woodhouse\n* [[Mark Strong]] as [[George Knightley]]\n* [[Samantha Morton]] as Harriet Smith\n* [[Olivia Williams]] as Jane Fairfax\n* [[James Hazeldine]] as Mr. Weston\n* [[Samantha Bond]] as Miss Taylor/Mrs. Weston\n* [[Raymond Coulthard]] as Frank Churchill\n* [[Dominic Rowan]] as Mr. Elton\n* [[Lucy Robinson (actress)|Lucy Robinson]] as Mrs. Elton\n* [[Prunella Scales]] as Miss Bates\n* Sylvia Barter as Mrs. Bates\n* [[Guy Henry (actor)|Guy Henry]] as John Knightley\n* [[Dido Miles]] as Isabella Knightley\n* [[Alistair Petrie]] as Robert Martin\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]] adapted [[Jane Austen]]'s 1815 novel ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'' for television. Previously, he was the screenwriter for the successful 1995 [[BBC]] TV serial ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV series)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' starring [[Jennifer Ehle]] and [[Colin Firth]]. Davies offered to adapt ''Emma'' for the BBC, but it had already commissioned [[Sandy Welch]] as screenwriter. Michael Wearing, BBC head of drama serials, stated \"It was a very, very difficult situation. I had already commissioned Sandy Welch, one of our BBC writers, to do ''Emma''. We really were in a fix.\"<ref name=Dramakings /> In response, Davies and his team successfully made an offer to BBC's rival, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].

In a contribution for the 2007 book ''Literary Intermediality: The Transit of Literature Through the Media Circuit'', Lydia Martin noted that unlike the 1996 theatrical film starring Paltrow, Davies' ''Emma'' displays a \"realistic, or even naturalistic, approach by focusing on the lower classes in which Jane Austen never really took any interest.\"<ref>{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xgIA0yjV8uUC&q=emma&pg=PA79 |title=Literary Intermediality: The Transit of Literature Through the Media Circuit |editor=Maddalena Pennacchia Punzi |publisher=Peter Lang |author=Martin, Lydia |chapter=Jane Austen on Screen: Deference and Divergence |year=2007 |page=67 |isbn=978-3-03911-223-4 |access-date=10 December 2020 |archive-date=6 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210206095817/https://books.google.com/books?id=xgIA0yjV8uUC&q=emma&pg=PA79 |url-status=live }}</ref> Indeed, adds Carole Dole, \"reminders of Highbury's class divisions are scattered throughout\" the production.

''[[People (magazine)|People]]''{{'}}s Tom Gliatto found it to be superior to the 1996 film, attributing this to Beckinsale's performance: \"Paltrow played the part with a swanlike haughtiness. Beckinsale is vibrantly girlish and romantic. And she looks smashing in [[Empire silhouette|Empire-waist]] dresses.\"<ref name=peoplereview /> Gliatto also positively commented on Davies' script for \"captur[ing] not just Austen's light charm but the pinpricks of her social criticism.\"<ref name=peoplereview>{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20143445,00.html |title=Picks and Pans Review: Emma |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |first=Tom |last=Gliatto |date=17 February 1997 |access-date=10 March 2013 |archive-date=22 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322142958/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20143445,00.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Caryn James of ''[[The New York Times]]'' added that in a story with an unlikeable heroine, Beckinsale \"walks [the] fine line beautifully...

The actress, Rosenfeld opined, \"looks at home in the dresses, cavernous houses and rolling countryside of Austen's 19th-century England, and yet seems modern in her alertness and in her way of not being intimidated by men.
