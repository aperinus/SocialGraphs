A series of flashbacks (with occasional reversions to the present) then narrates the story of Randal's life. An orphan, he is raised by his uncle along with his cousin Charlotte, who grows into an attractive young woman with whom he falls in love.  When Georges reaches twenty-one and asks for the money his parents left him, he finds that his unscrupulous uncle has stolen it all. He is rejected as a suitor for Charlotte because he is poor. She is then betrothed by her social-climbing father to a dim-witted aristocrat.  Georges steals  the fiance's family jewels and from then on, motivated by a sense of justice and desire for revenge, follows a successful career as a gentleman thief, targeting the haute bourgeoisie. At the end of the film, he has achieved all his aims: he is married to Charlotte, is living in his uncle's house, and has recovered the money his parents left him, as well as having accumulated a fortune through his crimes. Charlotte says to him 'You don't need to steal any more' but he replies 'You don't understand!' It is apparent that he has a compulsion to go on, knowing that he will eventually be caught. The final scene shows him boarding the train back to Paris with the haul from his latest robbery.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] as Georges Randal\n* [[Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold]] as Charlotte Randal\n* Christian Lude as Urbain Randal, uncle of Georges and father of Charlotte\n* [[Marie Dubois]] as Genevi\u00e8ve Delpiels\n* [[Julien Guiomar]] as L'abb\u00e9 F\u00e9lix la Margelle\n* [[Paul Le Person]] as Roger Voisin called Roger-La-Honte\n* [[Marl\u00e8ne Jobert]] as Broussaille, sister of Roger-La-Honte\n* [[Fran\u00e7oise Fabian]] as Ida\n* [[Bernadette Lafont]] as Marguerite \n* [[Martine Sarcey]] as Ren\u00e9e Mouratet\n* [[Jacques Debary]] as Courbassol\n* [[Charles Denner]] as Cannonier\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Malle on Malle'', edited by Philip French, Faber and Faber, 1993.\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0062457|title=The Thief of Paris}}\n*[http://www.lefilmguide.com/review/le-voleur-1967.html ''The Thief of Paris''] at Le Film Guide\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|the-thief-of-paris-le-voleur}}\n\n{{Louis Malle}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thief Of Paris, The}}\n[[Category:1967 films]]\n[[Category:1960s French-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Louis Malle]]\n[[Category:1967 crime films]]\n[[Category:French crime films]]\n[[Category:French heist films]]\n[[Category:French crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1900s]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re]]\n[[Category:1960s French films]]"}]}}}}
