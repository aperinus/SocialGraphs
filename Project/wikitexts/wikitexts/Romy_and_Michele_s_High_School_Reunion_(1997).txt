The plot revolves around two 28-year-old girls who appear to have not achieved much success in life, and decide to invent fake careers to impress former classmates at their ten-year [[Class reunion|high school reunion]]. The characters are taken from the stage play ''Ladies Room'', which also featured Kudrow.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics and is considered a [[Cult following|cult classic]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Vorona Cote |first=Rachel |date=27 September 2017 |title=\"Romy and Michele\" Is Still a Powerful Ode to Female Friendships |url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/turning-20/romy-and-micheles-high-school-reunion |access-date=1 April 2022 |website=[[Bitch Media]] |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=Levine |first=Nick |date=25 April 2017 |title=5 reasons why romy and michele's high school reunion is a low key feminist classic |url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/ywvve7/5-reasons-why-romy-and-micheles-high-school-reunion-is-a-low-key-feminist-classic |access-date=1 April 2022 |website=[[i-D]] |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nRomy White and Michele Weinberger live together in [[Venice, Los Angeles]], [[California]]. Romy works as a cashier in the service department at a [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] dealership and Michele is unemployed. They are single, unambitious, and enjoy a casual lifestyle of slacking, mocking TV and movies, and elaborate amateur [[Dressmaker|dressmaking]]. While working, Romy encounters former high school classmate, Heather Mooney, who informs Romy about their upcoming ten-year high school reunion in [[Tucson, Arizona]].\n\nAs high school students in 1987, they were picked on by the \"A-Group\", led by cheerleader Christie Masters, who humiliates them repeatedly. Finally, at the prom, Christie tricks Romy into believing that her boyfriend Billy Christianson was in love with Romy, and had dumped Christie to be with Romy. Romy waits all night to dance with Billy, who had already left with Christie. Michele dances with her instead.\n\nRomy realizes that their lack of achievements will not make a good impression at the reunion. Desperate to impress their former classmates, Romy and Michele make last-ditch attempts to improve themselves, hoping to avoid being bullied again.\n\nHaving failed to secure better jobs and boyfriends, Romy and Michele decide to fake success by showing up in an expensive car and business suits. Romy borrows a [[Jaguar XJ-S]] from a co-worker, and Michele makes their outfits. En route to the reunion, they decide to claim that they invented the [[Post-it Note]], believing that no one will know better. They argue over the details of their lie, which escalates into an argument about their friendship. They decide to go their separate ways once they reach the reunion.\n\nAt the reunion, Michele hears Romy claiming that she invented Post-its by herself. Michele convinces the A-Group she invented a special kind of glue. Sandy Frink, the nerd who had a crush on Michele in high school, has become wealthy and attractive since high school, and hits on Michele after hitting her with his limo. Billy and Romy reunite and hit it off. Both Romy and Michele win awards as the \"Most Changed For the Better Since High School\" members of their graduating class, but still refuse to speak with each other. Seventy years later, an elderly Michele learns that Romy is on her deathbed, and calls her to make amends. However, they rehash the same argument and Romy dies without resolving their issues.\n\nMichele wakes up alone in the Jaguar, realizing that she was dreaming. At the reunion, Romy starts to tell the Post-it story, but Heather blows the lie by revealing the [[Arthur Fry|real inventor]]'s name. Christie and her friends taunt Romy, and Michele ineptly defends her. Romy runs out, and Michele chases after her. They reconcile and decide to be themselves instead of trying to impress other people. They change into brightly colored homemade outfits and return to the reunion.\n\nThey confront Christie, who makes fun of their clothes. Former A-Group girl Lisa Luder, now a fashion editor, announces that the outfits are actually \"not bad\". Christie verbally attacks Lisa, who coolly dismisses her. The other A-Group girls abandon Christie, while everyone else congratulates Romy and Michele. Heather apologizes to Romy and Michele for ruining their story, and admits she was miserable in high school because she was in love with Sandy, who was in love with Michele. Romy and Michele comfort her by reminding her that she was always successful at making classmate Toby Walters miserable.\n\nSandy, who turns out to be an actual billionaire, arrives via helicopter. He confesses that he still loves Michele and asks her to dance with him. Michele agrees, as long as Romy can dance with them. After their interpretive dance to [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\" receives huge applause, Sandy escorts them to his helicopter. On their way out, they encounter Billy. Once a fit and handsome athlete, he is now an overweight alcoholic who is married to Christie, has a dead-end job working for Christie's father, and is unsure if he is the father of her latest pregnancy. He hits on Romy, who tells him to wait for her in his hotel room. She then leaves the reunion with Michele as the two women join Sandy in his helicopter. The reunion guests watch as the helicopter takes off.\n\nSix months later, back in Los Angeles, Romy and Michele use money loaned to them by Sandy to open a successful fashion boutique with their homemade designs.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Mira Sorvino]] as Romy White\n* [[Lisa Kudrow]] as Michele Weinberger\n* [[Janeane Garofalo]] as Heather Mooney\n* [[Alan Cumming]] as Sandy Frink\n* [[Julia Campbell]] as Christie Masters\n* [[Vincent Ventresca]] as Billy Christianson\n* [[Camryn Manheim]] as Toby Walters\n* Mia Cottet as Cheryl Quick\n* [[Elaine Hendrix]] as Lisa Luder\n* [[Kristin Bauer van Straten|Kristin Bauer]] as Kelly Possenger\n* [[Jacob Vargas]] as Ramon\n* [[Justin Theroux]] as Clarence the Cowboy\n* [[Tate Taylor]] as Casey Deegan\n* [[Rick Pasqualone]] as Mark Black\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nThe Romy and Michele characters first appeared in the 1988 stage play ''Ladies Room'', which was written by [[Robin Schiff]]. Schiff was in the comedy troupe [[The Groundlings]] with [[Lisa Kudrow]], who starred in the play as Michele opposite Christie Mellor as Romy.<ref name=\":1\" /> Schiff said her inspiration for the characters of Romy and Michele \u201cwere loosely based, just visually, on these girls I used to see going into a club on [[Sunset Boulevard|Sunset Blvd.]] You'd see these two friends, and they looked like they got dressed together and were wearing different versions of the same thing.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |last=Pirnia |first=Garin |date=April 24, 2017 |title=The Woman Who Created Romy and Michele Never Thought They'd Be So Popular |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/romy-and-michele-high-school-reunion-anniversary-screenwriter-interview |access-date=April 9, 2022 |website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n''Ladies Room'' was then adapted into a sitcom [[Television pilot|pilot]] called ''Just Temporary,'' with Kudrow and Mellor reprising their roles, but the pilot was not picked up.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Citation |last=Friedman |first=Kim |title=Just Temporary |date=1989-09-01 |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0925092/ |type=Comedy |publisher=Spelling Television |access-date=2022-04-09}}</ref> Around this time, film executives at the Disney subsidiary [[Touchstone Pictures|Touchstone]] came across Schiff's play while \"looking for a \u2018female version of ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'.\"''<ref name=\":1\" /> Schiff was initially reluctant to adapt the play into a film, thinking some scenes would not transfer well to a movie.
