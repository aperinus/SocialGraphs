Dubbed as a \"re-imagining\" of Raimi's ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' (1981), it is the fourth installment in the ''[[Evil Dead]]'' franchise.{{efn|Although labeled as a [[remake]] or [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]], \u00c1lvarez confirmed that the film exists in the same continuity and takes place sometime after the 1981 film.}} The film stars [[Jane Levy]], [[Shiloh Fernandez]], [[Lou Taylor Pucci]], [[Jessica Lucas]], and [[Elizabeth Blackmore]]. The film follows a group of five people being possessed and killed by supernatural entities in a remote cabin in the woods.\n\nTalks for a fourth ''Evil Dead'' film began in 2004, with original film actor [[Bruce Campbell]] the possibility for a next film in the franchise. The project was officially announced in July 2011, with [[Ghost House Pictures]] producing it, with [[Diablo Cody]] in the process of revising the script and Fede \u00c1lvarez chosen as the director. Much of the cast joined from January to February 2012. [[Filming]] took place in March 2012 and wrapped in May 2012 in [[New Zealand]] outside of [[Auckland]], lasting about a month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=10878484|title=Just how evil is the new Evil Dead?|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=April 19, 2013|access-date=January 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\n''Evil Dead'' had its [[world premiere]] at the [[South by Southwest]] film festival on March 8, 2013 and was theatrically released in the United States on April 5, 2013, by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]]. The film grossed $97 million worldwide against a production budget of $17 million, and received moderately positive reviews from critics. Another installment in the franchise, titled ''[[Evil Dead Rise]]'', written and directed by [[Lee Cronin (director)|Lee Cronin]], will be released in 2023.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens in 2008 with a teenage girl running through the woods until she is caught by two pursuing [[Hillbilly|hillbillies]]. Subdued with a sack over her head, she awakens to find herself tied up in the fruit cellar of a remote cabin, where an old woman is reciting incantations from a strange book. The girl pleads with her father Harold to release her. After he refuses, she reveals her possession by a demonic spirit and threatens to kill him. Harold sets her ablaze and shoots her dead. Three years later, in 2011, David Allen and his girlfriend Natalie arrive at the cabin with their dog Grandpa, where they meet his estranged younger sister Mia and her friends Eric, a high school teacher, and Olivia, a nurse. The group plans to stay in the cabin while Mia overcomes her [[heroin]] addiction. Mia begins having serious [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms and complains of an overwhelming scent of [[Decomposition|decay]], which the others ignore. David discovers that the cabin's cellar is littered with rotting animal corpses, a worn [[double-barrel shotgun]], and a book called the ''Naturom Demonto''.\n\nA curious Eric reads an [[incantation]] from the book, awakening a malevolent force. Mia begins seeing a bloody girl in the woods and begs the group to leave. They refuse, thinking that she must be seeing hallucinations. Mia steals Eric's car and leaves, but sees a naked girl and swerves, crashing into a tree. She runs into the woods, where vines from a demonic tree trap her. After Mia sees a demonic version of herself, a vine enters her body, possessing her.\n\nDavid finds Grandpa beaten to death with a hammer and goes to confront Mia in the shower. He sees her [[scalding]] herself and tries to drive her to a hospital, but a sudden rainstorm washes out the road. That night, Mia wounds her brother with the shotgun and vomits a large amount of red [[bile]] onto Olivia's face before Eric manages to lock her in the basement. Olivia is later possessed by unseen forces. When Eric discovers her in the shower mutilating her face, she stabs him repeatedly with a [[hypodermic needle]] before he bludgeons her to death. Mia lures Natalie into the cellar and bites her before slicing her own tongue apart with a box cutter, and then [[sexual assault|forcibly kissing her]]. David helps her escape before locking Mia back in.\n\nEric explains that according to the book, the \"Taker of Souls\" must claim five souls to unleash the \"Abomination\". Natalie, convinced that her arm is infected, amputates it. Eric explains that Mia must be \"purified\" either by live burial, dismemberment, or burning. The now-possessed Natalie attacks the pair with a nail gun, but David shoots her other arm off; Natalie returns to normal but soon [[Exsanguination|bleeds to death]] from her injury.\n\nDavid begins to douse the cabin in gasoline, but when Mia starts singing a song from their childhood, he decides to bury her instead. He digs a grave and heads into the cellar to retrieve Mia, who attempts to drown him. Eric intervenes but is fatally stabbed. David sedates and buries Mia, and after hearing her heartbeat stop, quickly digs her up and attempts to use a homemade defibrillator to resuscitate her. After several seemingly failed attempts, David covers his sister and says she's \"at peace\". Returning to the cabin, he hears a voice behind him and finds Mia alive. David enters the cabin to retrieve his car keys, but Eric's possessed corpse stabs him. David locks Mia out to protect her and shoots a gasoline can, killing both him and Eric in the resulting blaze.\n\nWith David's death, blood begins to rain down from the sky and Mia is attacked by the Abomination in the form of her demonic doppelg\u00e4nger. Mia finds a chainsaw and severs the Abomination's legs, but it retaliates by overturning David's Jeep which lands on her left arm and traps her. Pushed to her breaking point, Mia frees herself (losing her left hand in the process), grabs the chainsaw, and bisects the Abomination's head before it sinks back into the ground and the rain stops. An exhausted Mia leaves to search for help, unaware the ''Naturom Demonto'' is still intact, and slamming shut on its own.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, an older [[Ash Williams]] (the protagonist of the original three ''Evil Dead'' films) is seen in shadowed profile. He remarks \"Groovy\" before turning suddenly to face the camera.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Jane Levy]] as Mia Allen\n* [[Shiloh Fernandez]] as David Allen\n* [[Lou Taylor Pucci]] as Eric\n* [[Jessica Lucas]] as Olivia\n* [[Elizabeth Blackmore]] as Natalie\n* Phoenix Connolly as Teenager\n* Jim McLarty as Harold\n* Sian Davis as Old Woman\n* Stephen Butterworth as Toothless Redneck\n* Karl Willetts as Long Haired Redneck\n* Randal Wilson as Abomination\n* [[Rupert Degas]] as Demon Voice\n}}\n\nAdditionally, [[Bruce Campbell]] appears uncredited in the post-credits scene as [[Ash Williams]].
