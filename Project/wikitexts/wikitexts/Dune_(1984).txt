The film stars [[Kyle MacLachlan]] (in his film debut) as young nobleman [[Paul Atreides]]. It was filmed at the [[Churubusco Studios]] in [[Mexico City]] and included a [[Dune (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] by the [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Toto (band)|Toto]], as well as by [[Brian Eno]].\n\nSet in the distant future, the film chronicles the conflict between rival noble families as they battle for control of the extremely harsh desert planet [[Arrakis]], also known as \"Dune\". The planet is the only source of the drug [[Melange (fictional drug)|melange]] (spice), which allows [[prescience (Dune)|prescience]] and is vital to space travel, making it the most essential and valuable [[commodity]] in the universe. Paul Atreides is the scion and heir of a powerful noble family, whose inheritance of control over Arrakis brings them into conflict with its former overlords, [[House Harkonnen]]. Paul is also possibly the [[Kwisatz Haderach]], a messianic figure expected by the [[Bene Gesserit]] sisterhood. Besides MacLachlan, the film features a large [[ensemble cast]] of supporting actors, including [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Brad Dourif]], [[Dean Stockwell]], [[Virginia Madsen]], [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Linda Hunt]], and [[Max von Sydow]].\n\nAfter the novel's initial success, attempts to adapt ''Dune'' as a film began in 1971. A lengthy process of [[Development (film)|development]] followed throughout the 1970s, during which [[Arthur P. Jacobs]], [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], and [[Ridley Scott]] unsuccessfully tried to bring their visions to the screen. In 1981, [[executive producer]] [[Dino De Laurentiis]] hired Lynch as director.\n\nThe film was a [[box-office bomb]], grossing $30.9 million from a $40\u201342 million budget. At least four versions have been released worldwide. Lynch had his name removed from certain cuts of the film and was credited under pseudonyms. The film has developed a [[cult following]],<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 24, 2021 |url=https://www.polygon.com/22738264/dune-david-lynch-explained-galaxy-brains-podcast |title=David Lynch's ''Dune'' bombed, but was actually foundational |first=Dave |last=Schilling |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |access-date=February 8, 2022 }}</ref><ref name=\"Snyder\" /> but opinion varies among fans of the novel and fans of Lynch's films.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/new-dune-movie-explained-what-to-know-about-the-classic-sci-fi-novel |title=Dune Movie Explained: What to Know About the Classic Sci-Fi Novel |first=Jesse |last=Schedeen |date=October 21, 2021 |website=[[IGN]] }}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the far future, the known universe is ruled by the [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam IV]]. The most valuable substance in the empire is the spice [[Melange (fictional drug)|melange]], which extends life and expands consciousness. The spice also allows the [[Spacing Guild]] to [[fold space]], allowing safe, instantaneous [[interstellar travel]]. The Guild forces Shaddam to clarify a conspiracy that could jeopardize spice production forever. Shaddam reveals that he has transferred power and control of the planet [[Arrakis]], the only source of the spice, to [[House Atreides]], but once the Atreides arrive, they will be attacked by their archenemies, the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnens]], and Shaddam's own [[Sardaukar]] troops. Shaddam fears the Atreides due to a secret army that is reportedly being amassed by them.\n\n[[Duke Leto Atreides]]' loyal concubine, the [[Lady Jessica]], is an acolyte of the [[Bene Gesserit]], a female organization specializing in politics and their centuries-long [[breeding program]]. Jessica was ordered to bear a daughter, but disobeyed, giving birth to [[Paul Atreides]]. The breeding program's aim is to produce the [[Kwisatz Haderach]], a mental \"superbeing\" whom the Bene Gesserit would use to their advantage. Paul is tested by [[Gaius Helen Mohiam|Reverend Mother Mohiam]] of the Bene Gesserit to assess his impulse control. He passes to Mohiam's surprise.\n\nThe Atreides leave their homeworld [[Caladan]] for Arrakis, a barren [[desert planet]] populated by gigantic [[Sandworm (Dune)|sandworms]]. The native people of Arrakis, the [[Fremen]], prophesize that a messiah will lead them to freedom. [[Duncan Idaho]], one of Leto's loyalists, tells him that he suspects Dune holds vast numbers of Fremen who could prove to be powerful allies. Before Leto can form an alliance with the Fremen, the Harkonnens launch their attack. Leto's personal physician, Dr. [[Wellington Yueh]], who is a Harkonnen double agent, disables the shields, leaving the Atreides defenseless. Idaho is killed, Leto is captured, and nearly all of House Atreides is wiped out by the Harkonnens. Baron Harkonnen has [[Mentat]] [[Piter De Vries]] kill Yueh with a poisoned blade. Leto dies in a failed attempt to assassinate Baron Harkonnen using a poison-gas tooth implanted by Yueh in exchange for sparing the lives of Jessica and Paul.\n\nPaul and Jessica survive the attack and escape into the deep desert, where they are given sanctuary by a [[sietch]] of Fremen. Paul assumes the Fremen name [[Muad'Dib]] and emerges as the messiah for whom the Fremen have been waiting. He teaches them to use [[Weirding Modules]] \u2014 sonic weapons developed by House Atreides \u2014 and targets spice mining. Over the next two years, spice production is nearly halted. The Spacing Guild informs the Emperor of the deteriorating situation on Arrakis.\n\nPaul falls in love with young Fremen warrior [[Chani (character)|Chani]]. Jessica becomes the Fremen's Reverend Mother by ingesting the [[Water of Life (Dune)|Water of Life]], a deadly poison, which she renders harmless by using her Bene Gesserit abilities. As an after effect of this ritual, Jessica's unborn child, [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], later emerges from the womb with the full powers of an adult Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother. In a prophetic dream, Paul learns of the plot by the Emperor and the Guild to kill him. When Paul's dreams suddenly stop, he drinks the Water of Life and has a profound [[psychedelic experience|psychedelic trip]] in the desert. He gains powerful psychic powers and the ability to control the sandworms, which he realizes are the spice's source.\n\nThe Emperor amasses a huge invasion fleet above Arrakis to wipe out the Fremen and regain control of the planet. He has Rabban beheaded and summons Baron Harkonnen to explain why spice mining has stopped. Paul launches a final attack against the Harkonnens and the Emperor's Sardaukar at Arrakeen, the capital city. Riding atop sandworms and brandishing sonic weapons, Paul's Fremen warriors easily defeat the Emperor's legions. Paul's sister [[Alia Atreides|Alia]] assassinates the Baron Harkonnen. Paul confronts the Emperor and fights Feyd-Rautha in a duel to the death. After killing Feyd, Paul demonstrates his newfound powers and fulfills the Fremen prophecy by causing rain to fall on Arrakis. Alia declares him to be the Kwisatz Haderach.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Cast, order and roles in alphabetical order as presented in end credits -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Francesca Annis]] as [[Lady Jessica]], concubine of Duke Leto and mother to Paul and Alia\n* [[Leonardo Cimino]] as the Baron's Doctor\n* [[Brad Dourif]] as [[Piter De Vries]], the Harkonnen Mentat\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] as [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam IV]]\n* [[Linda Hunt]] as the [[Shadout Mapes]], the Fremen housekeeper of the Atreides' Arrakis palace\n* [[Freddie Jones]] as [[Thufir Hawat]], the Atreides Mentat\n* [[Richard Jordan]] as [[Duncan Idaho]], a Swordmaster of the Ginaz in the Atreides court\n* [[Kyle MacLachlan]] as [[Paul Atreides]], the Atreides heir\n* [[Virginia Madsen]] as [[Princess Irulan]], the Emperor's eldest daughter\n* [[Silvana Mangano]] as [[Reverend Mother Ramallo]], a Fremen woman who predicts Paul's arrival\n* [[Everett McGill]] as [[Stilgar]], the leader of the Fremen with whom Paul and Jessica take refuge\n* [[Kenneth McMillan (actor)|Kenneth McMillan]] as Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], Duke Leto's rival\n* [[Jack Nance]] as Nefud, the captain of Baron Harkonnen's guard\n* [[Si\u00e2n Phillips]] as Reverend Mother [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]], the Emperor's advisor and Jessica's Bene Gesserit superior\n* [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]] as Duke [[Leto I Atreides|Leto Atreides]], Paul's father\n* [[Paul L.

In mid-1971, film producer [[Arthur P.

For the cast, Jodorowsky envisioned [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] as the Emperor, [[Orson Welles]] as Baron Harkonnen, [[Mick Jagger]] as Feyd-Rautha, [[Udo Kier]] as Piter De Vries, [[David Carradine]] as Leto Atreides, his son, [[Brontis Jodorowsky]], as Paul Atreides, and [[Gloria Swanson]], among others.<ref name=\"Metal hurlant\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.duneinfo.com/unseen/jodorowsky.asp |title=''Dune: Le Film Que Voue Ne Verrez Jamais'' |trans-title=''Dune'': The Film You Will Never See |first=Alejandro |last=Jodorowsky |author-link=Alejandro Jodorowsky |magazine=[[M\u00e9tal hurlant]] |issue=107 |year=1985 |via=DuneInfo |access-date=2014-02-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429101454/http://www.duneinfo.com/unseen/jodorowsky.asp |archive-date=April 29, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The project was ultimately scrapped for several reasons, largely because funding dried up when the project ballooned to a 10\u201314 hour epic.<ref>{{cite AV media | title =[[Jodorowsky's Dune]] |people=[[Frank Pavich]] (director) |date=2013 |medium=Documentary}}</ref>\n\nAlthough their version of the film never reached production, the work that Jodorowsky and his team put into ''Dune'' did have a significant impact on subsequent science-fiction films. In particular, ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979), written by O'Bannon, shared much of the same creative team for the visual design as had been assembled for Jodorowsky's film.

R. Giger retained from the Jodorowsky production.<ref name=\"nytimes production\"/> Scott intended to split the book into two movies. He worked on three drafts of the script, using ''[[The Battle of Algiers]]'' as a point of reference, before moving on to direct another science-fiction film, ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982). As he recalls, the pre-production process was slow, and finishing the project would have been even more time-intensive:\n\n<blockquote>But after seven months I dropped out of ''Dune'', by then Rudy Wurlitzer had come up with a first-draft script, which I felt was a decent distillation of Frank Herbert's (book). But I also realized ''Dune'' was going to take a lot more work\u2014at least two and a half years' worth. And I didn't have the heart to attack that because my [older] brother Frank unexpectedly died of cancer while I was prepping the De Laurentiis picture. Frankly, that freaked me out. So, I went to Dino and told him the ''Dune'' script was his.\n:\u2014From ''Ridley Scott: The Making of His Movies'' by Paul M. Sammon<ref name=\"BookToScreenTimeline\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Lynch's screenplay and direction ===\nIn 1981, the nine-year film rights were set to expire. De Laurentiis renegotiated the rights from the author, adding to them the rights to the ''Dune'' sequels (written and unwritten).<ref name=\"nytimes production\"/> He then showed the book to [[Sid Sheinberg]], president of [[MCA Inc.|MCA]], the then parent company of [[Universal City Studios]], which approved the book. After seeing ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'', producer [[Raffaella De Laurentiis]] decided that David Lynch should direct the movie. Around that time, Lynch received several other directing offers, including ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''. De Laurentiis contacted Lynch, who said he had not heard of the book. After reading it and \"loving it\", he met with De Laurentiis and agreed to direct the film.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Sammon|first=Paul M. |url=https://archive.org/stream/cinefantastique_1970-2002/Cinefantastique%20Vol%2014%20No%204-5%20%28Sept%201984%29#page/n29/mode/2up |title=David Lynch's ''Dune''|magazine=[[Cinefantastique]] |date=September 1984 |volume=14|number=4/5|page=31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite AV media |title=David Lynch Interview from 1985 on Dune|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvCeLzC2sNs|language=en|access-date=2021-10-25|archive-date=October 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211025161253/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvCeLzC2sNs|url-status=live}}</ref> Lynch worked on the script for six months with [[Eric Bergren]] and Christopher De Vore. The team yielded two drafts of the script before they split over creative differences. Lynch subsequently worked on five more drafts. Initially, Lynch had scripted out ''Dune'' across two films, but eventually was condensed into a single film.<ref name=\"nytimes production\"/>\n\nVirginia Madsen said in 2016 that she was signed for three films, as the producers \"thought they were going to make ''[[Star Wars original trilogy|Star Wars]]'' for grown-ups.\"<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2l_UJzn7L7A|title=Virginia Madsen on ''Dune''|date=September 11, 2016|website=DuneInfo|via=[[YouTube]]|access-date=July 16, 2018|archive-date=April 24, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200424062743/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2l_UJzn7L7A|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn March 30, 1983, with the 135-page sixth draft of the script, ''Dune'' finally began shooting. It was shot entirely in Mexico, mostly at [[Churubusco Studios]]; De Laurentiis said this was due in part to the favorable exchange rate to get more value for their production budget, and that no studio in Europe had the expansive capabilities they needed for the production. With a budget over $40\u201342 million, ''Dune'' required 80 sets built on 16 sound stages, and had a total crew of 1,700, with over 20,000 extras. Many of the exterior shots were filmed in the [[Samalayuca Dune Fields]] in [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]].<ref name=\"nytimes production\"/><ref name=\"Dune, Behind the Scenes\">{{cite web|title=Emilio Ruiz del R\u00edo|website=DuneInfo|url=http://www.duneinfo.com/arrakis/erdr/|access-date=21 July 2012|archive-date=November 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111120740/http://www.duneinfo.com/arrakis/erdr/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Samalayuca Dunes declared natural protected zone |url=http://www.chihuahuanfrontier.com/state/news/65-samalayuca.html |website=Chihuahuan Frontier |date=June 9, 2009 |access-date=July 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130119015806/http://www.chihuahuanfrontier.com/state/news/65-samalayuca.html |archive-date=January 19, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref> Filming ran for at least six months into September 1983, plagued by various production problems such as failing electricity or communication lines due to the country's infrastructure, or health-related problems with their cast and crew.<ref name=\"nytimes production\"/>\n\n=== Editing ===\nThe rough cut of ''Dune'' without [[post-production]] effects ran over four hours long, but Lynch's intended cut of the film (as reflected in the seventh and final draft of the script) was almost three hours long. Universal and the film's financiers expected a standard, two-hour cut of the film. Dino De Laurentiis, his daughter Raffaella, and Lynch excised numerous scenes, filmed new scenes that simplified or concentrated plot elements, and added [[voice-over]] narrations, plus a new introduction by Virginia Madsen. Contrary to rumor, Lynch made no other version besides the theatrical cut. A television version was aired in 1988 in two parts totaling 186 minutes; it replaced Madsen's opening monologue with a much longer description of the setting that used [[concept art]] stills. Lynch disavowed this version and had his name removed from the credits, with [[Alan Smithee]] being credited instead. The name Alan Smithee is a pseudonym used by directors who wish not to be associated with a film for which they would normally be credited. The extended and television versions additionally credit writer Lynch as [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] [[John Wilkes Booth|Booth]]. This version (without recap and second credit roll) has previously been released on DVD as ''Dune: Extended Edition''.
