It is a remake of the 1967 [[Bedazzled (1967 film)|British film of the same name]], written by [[Peter Cook]] and [[Dudley Moore]], which was itself a comic retelling of the [[Faust]] legend.\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Satan|Devil]] runs a computer simulation to analyze souls to determine individual weaknesses to exploit. The program settles on Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser), a geeky, over-zealous man working a dead-end job in a [[San Francisco]] computer company. He has no friends and his co-workers avoid him. He has a crush on colleague Alison Gardner ([[Frances O'Connor]]), but lacks the courage to ask her out. After Elliot is ditched by his co-workers at a bar while trying to talk to Alison, he says he would give anything for Alison to be with him. The Devil, in the form of a beautiful woman (Elizabeth Hurley), overhears him and offers to give Elliot seven wishes in exchange for his soul.\n\nAs a test, Elliot wishes for a [[Big Mac]] and a large [[Coca-Cola|Coke]]. The Devil takes him to [[McDonald's]] and places the order. Elliot has to pay for it, because, \"[[There's no such thing as a free lunch]].\" After taking Elliot to her office, based at a nightclub in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], the Devil convinces Elliot to sign her  contract, and delivers further wishes. Each wish has Elliot living them out with Alison and his co-workers in surrogate roles. However, the Devil always spoils his wishes by [[quibble (plot device)|adding something]] he does not expect or want.\n\nAfter going through five wishes, Elliot is arrested after [[Confession (religion)|confessing]] his story to a priest who believed he was [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]]. The Devil, dressed as a police officer, throws him in a cell, telling him that she likes him, and it would not hurt to have her as a friend. Elliot's friendly cellmate tells him that he cannot sell his soul as it belongs to [[God]], and although the Devil may try to confuse him, in the end he will realize who he truly is, and what his purpose is. Elliot questions the man as to his identity, but the response is simply \"a really good friend\".\n\nElliot asks the Devil to cancel their contract. When the Devil refuses, Elliot states he will not use his final wish. The Devil teleports them to Hell. When the Devil pushes him to make a final wish, Elliot wishes that Alison could have a happy life - with or without him. The Devil sighs and Elliot falls into the depths of Hell. He wakes up on a marble staircase, wondering if it is [[Heaven]]. The Devil tells him that a provision in the contract's [[fine print]] states that a selfless wish voids the contract. Elliot admits that despite her manipulation of him he has come to like the Devil and regards her as a friend. She advises that Heaven and Hell can be found on Earth; it is up to humans to choose. Elliot asks Alison out, but discovers she is already dating another man. He continues with his life, with a better understanding of who he is.\n\nElliot is confronted by Bob, one of his co-workers, who ridicules Elliot at the encouragement of his co-workers. Elliot grabs a terrified Bob by the shirt, but lets go, simply saying, \"Nice talking to you.\" At home, he meets a new neighbor, Nicole Delarusso, whose looks resemble Alison's but whose personality, interests and fashion sense are much closer to his. He offers to help her unpack and they begin a relationship. While the two walk along a boulevard, the Devil and Elliot's cellmate, both dressed in white, are playing [[chess]]. The Devil's computer program lists Nicole and Elliot's foibles, which they tolerate.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brendan Fraser]] as Elliot Richards / Jefe / \"Mary\" / [[Abraham Lincoln]]\n* [[Elizabeth Hurley]] as The Devil \n* [[Frances O'Connor]] as Alison Gardner / Nicole Delarusso\n* [[Orlando Jones]] as Daniel / Dan / Danny / Esteban / Beach Jock / Lamar Garrett / Dr. Ngegitigegitibaba\n* [[Paul Adelstein]] as Bob Bob / Roberto / Beach Jock\n* [[Toby Huss]] as Jerry / Alejandro / Beach Jock / Jerry Turner / Lance\n* [[Miriam Shor]] as Carol / Penthouse Hostess\n* [[Gabriel Casseus]] as Elliot's Cellmate\n* [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Priest\n* [[Jeff Doucette]] as Desk Sergeant\n* [[Aaron Lustig]] as Synedyne supervisor\n* [[Rudolf Martin]] as Raoul\n* [[Julian Firth]] as [[John Wilkes Booth]]\n\n==Release==\n===Home media===\n''Bedazzled'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[VHS]] on March 13, 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.thedigitalbits.com/reviews2/bedazzledse.html|title=DVD Review - Bedazzled: Special Edition - The Digital Bits}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film did reasonably well at the box office.

It is lacking in wickedness. It doesn't smack its lips when it's naughty. When its hero sells his soul to the devil, what results isn't diabolical effrontery, but a series of contract negotiations and consumer complaints. This is twice in two weeks (after the [[Winona Ryder]] exorcism movie ''[[Lost Souls (2000 film)|Lost Souls]]'') that Satan loses on points.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=2000-10-20 |last= Ebert |first= Roger |author-link= Roger Ebert |url= http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/bedazzled-2000 |title=Bedazzled Movie Review & Film Summary (2000) |publisher= [[Chicago Sun-Times]]|access-date= 2014-04-08 }}</ref> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''{{'}} [[Kenneth Turan]] stated that \"as written by Larry Gelbart, director Harold Ramis and Peter Tolan, this 'Bedazzled,' though amusing from moment to moment, is erratic, unfocused and uncertain where it's going.

What should be a drawing-room comedy ends with moments best left to ''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)|Gone in 60 Seconds]]''.\"<ref name=\"tribdev\">{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com.stage.tribdev.com/topic/cl-movie001019-3,0,2969326.story |title= Bedazzled  |work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2014-04-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140408233731/http://www.latimes.com.stage.tribdev.com/topic/cl-movie001019-3%2C0%2C2969326.story |archive-date= 2014-04-08 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote|Bedazzled (2000 film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|0230030|Bedazzled}}\n* {{AllMovie title|196446|Bedazzled}}\n* {{TCMDb title|450917|Bedazzled}}\n* {{AFI film|61046}}\n* {{Mojo title|bedazzled|Bedazzled}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=Bedazzled}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|1101051_bedazzled|Bedazzled}}\n\n{{Harold Ramis}}\n{{Faust navbox}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:2000 fantasy films]]\n[[Category:2000 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s romantic fantasy films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:American remakes of British films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic fantasy films]]\n[[Category:The Devil in film]]\n[[Category:Fictional depictions of Abraham Lincoln in film]]\n[[Category:Films about reincarnation]]\n[[Category:Films about wish fulfillment]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Harold Ramis]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Harold Ramis]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Newman]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Harold Ramis]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Larry Gelbart]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Peter Tolan]]\n[[Category:German fantasy comedy films]]\n[[Category:English-language German films]]\n[[Category:German romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:German romantic fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Regency Enterprises films]]\n[[Category:Works based on the Faust legend]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s German films]]"}]}}}}
