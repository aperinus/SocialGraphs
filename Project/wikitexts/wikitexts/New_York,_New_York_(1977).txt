It is a musical tribute, featuring new songs by [[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]] as well as [[jazz standard]]s, to Scorsese's home town of [[New York City]], and stars [[Liza Minnelli]] and [[Robert De Niro]] as a pair of musicians and lovers. The story is \"about a jazz saxophonist (De Niro) and a pop singer (Minnelli) who fall madly in love and marry;\" however, the \"saxophonist's outrageously volatile personality places a continual strain on their relationship, and after they have a baby, their marriage crumbles,\" even as their careers develop on separate paths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/new_york_new_york/|title=New York, New York|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> The film marked the final screen appearance of actor [[Jack Haley]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn [[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]] in 1945, a massive celebration in a New York City nightclub is underway, music provided by the [[Tommy Dorsey|Tommy Dorsey Orchestra]]. While there, selfish and smooth-talking [[saxophone]] player Jimmy Doyle (De Niro) meets small-time USO singer Francine Evans (Minnelli), who, although lonely, still wants nothing to do with Jimmy, who keeps pestering her for her phone number.\n\nThe next morning, they end up sharing a cab, and, against her will, Francine accompanies Jimmy to an audition. There he gets into an argument with the club owner. Francine, to get the audition back on track, begins to sing the old standard, \"[[You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me]]\"; Jimmy joins in on his sax. The club owner is impressed and, to Francine's astonishment, they are both offered a job\u2014as a traveling boy-girl act. From that moment on, Jimmy and Francine's relationship deepens into a mix of obsession and love. But there are problems\u2014mainly, Jimmy's tendency to fight with his co-workers, overly dramatic behavior, and his increasingly violent arguments with Francine, who becomes pregnant with his child. An especially bad shouting match between them results in Francine going into labor. Jimmy rushes her to the hospital, where she delivers a baby boy. But Jimmy is not ready to be a father, or a good husband, and he abandons his wife, declining even to see his newborn son as he leaves the hospital.\n\nSeveral years later, in a recording studio, Francine records \"But the World Goes Round,\" a powerful anthem which makes the charts and turns her into a popular entertainment figure. In the years that follow, Jimmy and Francine both find success in the music industry; he becomes a renowned [[jazz musician]] and club owner, while she becomes a successful singer and film actress.\n\nJimmy records a song of his on his saxophone which tops the jazz charts, and Francine cements her stardom after singing that same song, \"[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]],\" for which she has provided the lyrics. Her performance, received by a wildly appreciative audience, takes place in the same nightclub where, years earlier, she and Jimmy had met. After the show, Jimmy telephones his ex-wife, suggesting they get together for dinner. Francine is tempted, heads toward the stage door exit, but at the last moment changes her mind. Jimmy, waiting on the sidewalk, realizes he has been stood up and heads off down the street, accompanied by the song he has written\u2014the \"Theme from ''New York, New York''{{-\"}}.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Liza Minnelli]] as Francine Evans\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Jimmy Doyle\n* [[Lionel Stander]] as Tony Harwell\n* [[Barry Primus]] as Paul Wilson\n* [[Mary Kay Place]] as Bernice Bennett\n* [[Frank Sivero]] as Eddie DiMuzio\n* [[Georgie Auld]] as Frankie Harte\n* [[George Memmoli]] as Nicky\n* [[Harry Northup]] as Alabama\n* [[Dick Miller]] as Palm Club Owner\n* [[Clarence Clemons]] as Cecil Powell\n* [[Casey Kasem]] as DJ aka Midnight Bird\n* Adam David Winkler as Jimmy Doyle, Jr.\n* [[Jack Haley]] (''uncredited cameo'') as Master of Ceremonies\n}}\n\n==Music==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n# \"Main Title\" (Theme / You Are My Lucky Star / Just You, Just Me / The Man I Love - Medley) - Ralph Burns (1:53)\n# \"[[You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me]]\" - Liza Minnelli (1:47)\n# \"Flip the Dip\" - orchestra (2:13)\n# \"V.J.

United Artists ultimately recouped its loss on the film as a result of an agreement wherein they would share the profits with ''[[Rocky]]'', which the executives had expected to be a flop.<ref>{{cite news| title = EW: The Right Hook: How Rocky Nabbed Best Picture | url = https://ew.com/article/2002/02/19/how-rocky-nabbed-best-picture/ | work= [[Entertainment Weekly]] | first=Chris | last=Nashawaty | date=2002-02-19}}</ref>\n\nIn his introduction to the film's DVD, released in 2005, Scorsese explains that he intended the film as a break from the gritty realism for which he had become famous, and sees it as an homage to the [[musical film]]s of [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Classical Hollywood]]. For this reason, he designed the film's sets and storyline to be deliberately artificial-looking.
