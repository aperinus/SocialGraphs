On the ground floor is a [[butcher]]'s shop, run by the [[landlord]], Clapet, who posts job opportunities in the newspaper to lure victims to the building, whom he murders and butchers as a cheap source of meat to sell to his tenants.\n\nFollowing the murder of the last worker, unemployed [[circus]] [[clown]] Louison applies for the vacant position. Louison proves to be a superb worker with a spectacular trick knife, and the butcher is reluctant to kill him too quickly. During Louison's routine maintenance, he acquires a package dropped by a mailman. Louison delivers the package to Clapet's daughter, Julie, who says the package contains confections and invites him to join her that evening. Louison and Julie's relationship blossoms into romance.  At the same time, several of the tenants fall under Louison's boyish charms, worrying others who are more anxious for their own safety should they require meat.\n\nClapet tells apartment tenant Marcel Tapioca that his rent is late and he must give up his mother-in-law as payment. That evening, Julie begs her father to let Louison go, knowing that Clapet is killing tenants for meat. She goes to her apartment, unwraps a newspaper in her refrigerator and sees an article about the Troglodistes, a group of vegetarian rebels who live underground. Julie descends into the sewers to make contact with the feared Troglodistes, whom she persuades to help rescue Louison.<ref>{{Citation|last=McGrath|first=James F.|title=INTRODUCTION|date=2012-09-27|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/j.ctt1cgdw1p.4|work=Religion and Science Fiction|pages=1\u20138|publisher=The Lutterworth Press|doi=10.2307/j.ctt1cgdw1p.4|isbn=978-0-7188-4096-9|access-date=2021-04-03}}</ref>\n\nAfter the apparent butchering of Tapioca's mother-in-law, the Troglodistes go through the sewer pipes and attempt to capture Louison, but end up mistakenly capturing tenant Mademoiselle Plusse instead. Meanwhile, as Julie and Louison watch television, Clapet ascends to the roof, shaking the television antenna to lure Louison into going up to fix it. Attacking Louison with a cleaver, Clapet's attempt to kill him is foiled by an unexpected electrical explosion in one of the apartments.\n\nClapet, along with some tenants, storms Louison's room in another attempt to murder him. Louison and Julie take refuge in a bathroom and flood it, floor to ceiling, until Clapet opens the door, releasing the flood and washing the attackers away. Mademoiselle Plusse escapes the sewers, finds Louison's boomerang knife, and gives it to Clapet. Clapet throws the knife towards Louison, but inadvertently kills himself. Louison and Julie play music together on the roof of the now peaceful apartment building.<ref>{{Citation|last=Carlos.|first=Jeunet, Jean-Pierre, 1955- Caro, Marc. Adrien, Gilles. Schneid, Herv\u00e9.

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it \"a zany little film that's a startling and clever debut.\" ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' called it a \"fair bet for cultdom, a lot more likeable than its subject matter suggests, and simply essential viewing for vegetarians\". [[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] described the movie as having \"striking visual aesthetic inspired by the monochrome photography of French-Hungarian photographer Brassa\u00ef, and the fantasy films of Terry Gilliam\".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Balmont|first=James|title=The French father of Hollywood sci-fi is still planning his masterpiece (Exclusive)|url=https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/marc-caro-delicatessen-alien-city-of-lost-children|access-date=2021-04-20|website=Inverse|language=en}}</ref>\n\nNot all reviews were positive, however, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' saying \"its last half-hour is devoted chiefly to letting the characters wreck the sets, and quite literally becomes a washout when the bathtub overflows.\"\n\nAlthough Delicatessen examines the resistance movement in [[German-occupied Europe]], few film critics commented on this theme upon its initial release.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Graeme|date=1999|title=Replaying history as farce: Postmodernism and the construction of Vichy in Delicatessen|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09639489908456486|journal=Modern & Contemporary France|volume=7|issue=2|pages=197\u2013207|doi=10.1080/09639489908456486|issn=0963-9489}}</ref>\n\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave it an approval rating of 89% from a total of 54 reviews with an average rating of 7.76/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet deftly combines horror, sci-fi, and humor in ''Delicatessen'', a morbid comedy set in a visually ravishing futuristic dystopia.\" [[Metacritic]] gave it 66 out of 100 out of a total of 17 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"\n\n===Accolades===\nThe film has won and been nominated for several important European awards.
