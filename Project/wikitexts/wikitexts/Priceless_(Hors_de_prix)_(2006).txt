According to the director, the film is inspired by the 1961 [[Blake Edwards]] film ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]''.<ref>{{cite web| first= John | last= Beifuss | url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2008/may/23/tautou-makes-priceless-worth-cost-of-admission/|date=23 May 2008|title=Film review: Tautou makes 'Priceless' worth cost of admission| publisher= [[The Commercial Appeal]]| accessdate=2012-07-09}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nJean ([[Gad Elmaleh]]) is a waiter/barman at a luxury hotel. Ir\u00e8ne ([[Audrey Tautou]]), is a gold digger who convinces wealthy men to fund her lavish lifestyle in exchange for companionship and sex. When Ir\u00e8ne's elderly lover gets drunk and falls asleep on her birthday, she goes to the hotel bar, where she assumes the barman is absent and Jean is a millionaire guest. Rather than correcting her, he makes her several impressive cocktails and they then retire, tipsy, to the hotel's Imperial suite where they spend the night together. In the morning, Jean awakens to find Ir\u00e8ne has gone.\n\nA year later, Ir\u00e8ne returns to the hotel with Jacques, who asks her to marry him. Ir\u00e8ne is surprised to see Jean, and he manages to conceal his occupation from her again. Jean and Ir\u00e8ne sleep together again, but Jacques sees them and breaks off the [[engagement]]. Ir\u00e8ne goes to Jean, pretending she gave up Jacques to be with him, but as they lie in bed together, they are discovered by guests and staff in the Imperial suite. When Ir\u00e8ne discovers who Jean really is, she walks out. However, Jean is now in love and follows her, finding her at the [[C\u00f4te d'Azur]]. Pursuing her, he spends all the money to his name to pay for her presence, including his savings and pension plan, until he uses his final [[euro]] for \"10 more seconds\" to look into her eyes.\n\nIr\u00e8ne leaves him for another rich man, and Jean is left with a hotel bill he cannot pay. Luckily, Jean is picked up by a wealthy widow, Madeleine, who pays his bills in exchange for his companionship. Ir\u00e8ne bumps into him again with another lover, Gilles. She is a little jealous, but now that they are \"equals\", she teaches Jean the tricks of gold-digging. Using her advice, he soon wheedles a \u20ac30,000 watch from Madeleine, after she forced him to have plastic surgery on his ear. On a shopping spree, Ir\u00e8ne meets up with Jean and coyly offers him the euro for \"10 more seconds\".\n\nJean continues to prove himself a skillful gold digger. He and Ir\u00e8ne steal away from their patrons every chance they can, falling in love in the process. On the morning of Ir\u00e8ne's departure for [[Venice]], Gilles catches Ir\u00e8ne and Jean kissing on the hotel room balcony.\n\nFurious, Gilles leaves Ir\u00e8ne at the hotel with nothing but a [[sarong]] and the swimsuit she is wearing. Jean sells his watch to buy Ir\u00e8ne a week's stay in their hotel and a gorgeous evening gown. He also gives her an invitation to a party. Madeleine is at first upset with Jean for selling his watch, but Jean calms her down by giving her a pair of earrings. He claims that he pawned the watch to buy Madeleine a gift and she is pleased.\n\nAt the party that evening, Ir\u00e8ne sees Jacques again, but with a new young girlfriend, Agn\u00e8s. While stealing a dance with Jean, Ir\u00e8ne hatches a plan to win Jacques back again, with Jean's assistance. Jean agrees to play along and is dumped by Madeleine in the process. However, he convinces Agn\u00e8s that he is a prince and seduces her away from Jacques, giving Ir\u00e8ne a chance to steal Jacques. However, when Ir\u00e8ne sees Jean with Agn\u00e8s on the balcony, she realizes she loves Jean. She runs away from Jacques and declares her love, abandoning her pursuit of a luxurious lifestyle. The movie ends with barefoot Ir\u00e8ne and Jean riding off to Italy on his scooter, using the euro coin for the toll fee.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Audrey Tautou]] as Ir\u00e8ne Mercier\n* [[Gad Elmaleh]] as Jean Simon\n* [[Marie-Christine Adam]] as Madeleine\n* [[Vernon Dobtcheff]] as Jacques\n* [[Jacques Spiesser]] as Gilles\n* [[Annelise Hesme]] as Agn\u00e8s\n\n==Critical response==\nThe review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 82% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 72 reviews. The site's consensus reads, \"''Priceless'' is a light, farcical rom-com that features sharp performances from Audrey Tautou and Gad Elmaleh.\".<ref name=\"tomatoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/priceless/ |title=Priceless Movie Reviews, Pictures |accessdate=2008-03-29 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] reported the film had an average score of 72 out of 100, based on 20 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/priceless |title=Priceless (2008): Reviews |accessdate=2010-05-15 |publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref>\n\nAfter its March 2008 premiere in the United States, [[Stephen Holden]] called the film an \"amusing ball of fluff that refuses to judge its characters\u2019 amoral high jinks\";  he calls it a \"shrewdly cast\" film \"winking at the vanity of wealthy voluptuaries and hustlers playing games of tainted love.\"  According to Holden, the film is \"too frivolous even to be called satire.\"<ref>{{cite web| title= Cherchez le Sugar Daddy (et Sugar Mom) | date= March 28, 2008 | first= Stephen |last=Holden | url= https://movies.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/movies/28pric.html | work= The New York Times | accessdate=2012-07-09}}</ref>  According to [[Mick LaSalle]], what makes the film \"fun\" is \"the harshness wrapped in a pretty package. The movie stars Audrey Tautou and Gad Elmaleh, who are about the only French stars that it's almost impossible to imagine having an active sex life. Their aura of innocence helps. Still, in America, no director could ever make this movie, even with the most innocent-seeming actors on the planet. This is way European, folks, not meant for our eyes, and, of course, that's the whole kick.\" LaSalle notes the following:<ref>{{cite web| title= Review: Tautou is gold digger in ''Priceless''| date= April 4, 2008| first= Mick |last=LaSalle| url= http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Review-Tautou-is-gold-digger-in-Priceless-3219375.php| publisher= San Francisco Chronicle | accessdate=2012-07-09}}</ref><blockquote> \"''Priceless'' is an entertaining sex farce that takes its characters to some of best hotels and most exclusive restaurants in France, and to watch it is to marvel at how some people live - and how you don't. But here's the interesting thing: Through this seduction, ''Priceless'' turns the viewer into a harlot, too, who can suddenly understand why Irene would do anything and sleep with anybody just to stay in this lifestyle. Likewise, we understand&mdash;instinctively, without thinking about it or judging it&mdash;why Jean might start sleeping with an older rich woman, just so he can stay in the hotels where Irene stays. Would you want to be the person who orders the drinks or fetches the drinks? How easy would it be to go back to normal life after confirming what you never really wanted to know, that the rich really do have it better, as in a lot better, as in money really does buy happiness?  So ''Priceless'' is silly, but it's not so silly. It's pretty to look at, often very funny, but it corrupts its audience as it corrupts its characters.\"  </blockquote>   In a one-star review ({{rating|1|5}}) upon the film's June 2008 release in the United Kingdom, [[Peter Bradshaw]] call the film a \"gruesomely unfunny and tacky comedy-farce\" and notes \"the whole movie slavers over [[bling]], and has a nasty, dated air of pseudo-worldliness and ersatz sophistication. With its luxury-tourist locations, it is basically vulgar, and not in a good way, and reminded me of the opening title sequence to the 70s TV show ''[[The Persuaders!]]'', but without that programme's charm.\"<ref>{{cite web| title= Priceless| date= 12 June 2008| first= Peter |last=Bradshaw| url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jun/13/drama1| work= The Guardian| accessdate=2012-07-09}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Cite web|url=http://www.tfmdistribution.com/horsdeprix/|title=Official site|language=fr|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901080257/http://www.tfmdistribution.com/horsdeprix/|archivedate=1 September 2009}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0482088|title=Priceless}}\n* {{AllRovi movie|381129|Priceless}}\n\n{{Pierre Salvadori}}\n\n[[Category:2006 films]]\n[[Category:2006 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:French romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s French-language films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Monaco]]\n[[Category:Films set in France]]\n[[Category:Films set in hotels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Pierre Salvadori]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]"}]}}}}
