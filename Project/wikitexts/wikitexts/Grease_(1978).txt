When the summer comes to an end, Sandy frets that they may never meet again, but Danny tells her that their love is \"only the beginning\".\n\nAt the start of the seniors' term at Rydell High School, Danny resumes his role as leader of the T-Birds [[greaser (subculture)|greaser]] gang consisting of Doody, Sonny, Putzie, and his best friend Kenickie. Sandy's parents remain in America and enroll Sandy at Rydell where she meets greaser girl clique the Pink Ladies consisting of Frenchy, Marty, Jan and leader Rizzo.\n\nDanny and Sandy recount their brief romance to their respective groups, Sandy recalling a romantic summer and Danny implying a more physical experience. When Sandy finally says Danny's name, Rizzo arranges a surprise reunion at a pep rally where Sandy meets Tom, a [[Jock (stereotype)|jock]], and Kenickie unveils his new used car, Greased Lightnin', which he plans on [[street racing]] after a restoration. Caught between his feelings and his bad-boy reputation, Danny snubs Sandy in front of his gang and she becomes upset.\n\nAt a Pink Ladies pajama party, Sandy falls ill from drinking, trying a cigarette, and having her ears pierced by Frenchy, while Rizzo, after mocking Sandy's wholesome and chaste personality, departs for sex with Kenickie in his car, during which their condom breaks; they are disturbed by Leo, leader of the rival gang, the Scorpions, and his girlfriend Cha-Cha. After the slumber party comes to an end, Sandy realizes she still loves Danny after all.\n\nThe next day, Danny apologizes to Sandy for having brushed her off the night earlier and, with Coach Calhoun's help, becomes a runner and successfully wins her back from Tom, but their friends crash their date, and Kenickie and Rizzo break up after an argument. After a disastrous beauty class leaves Frenchy with candy-pink hair, she reluctantly decides to return to Rydell to complete her high-school education.\n\nDuring the school dance, broadcast live on ''[[American Bandstand|National Bandstand]]'' and hosted by DJ Vince Fontaine, Rizzo and Kenickie spite each other by bringing Leo and Cha-Cha as their dates. In a chaotic [[hand jive]], Danny and Sandy dance well, but just before the winners are announced, Sonny pulls Sandy away and Cha-Cha cuts in to win with Danny, as Sandy storms out. Danny tries to make it up to Sandy by taking her to a drive-in theater but she flees in horror after he attempts to have sex with her. Rizzo fears she is pregnant after missing a period and confides in Marty, who tells Sonny, who inadvertently spreads the rumor to the apparent father Kenickie, though Rizzo denies it to him.\n\nOn race day, Kenickie is concussed by his own car door, so Danny takes the wheel, winning the race after Leo spins out. Sandy, watching from afar and delighted with Danny's victory, concludes she still loves him and enlists Frenchy's help in changing her attitude and looks to impress him.\n\nOn the last day of school, Rizzo finds she is not pregnant and reunites with Kenickie. Danny and Sandy each find they have changed for each other: Danny has become a [[Letterman (sports)|letterman]], and Sandy a greaser girl. The two depart in the Greased Lightnin' car, which takes flight.\n\n==Cast==\n=== Principal cast ===\n==== Protagonists ====\n* [[John Travolta]] as Danny Zuko\n* [[Olivia Newton-John]] as Sandy Olsson\n\n==== T-Birds ====\n* [[Jeff Conaway]] as Kenickie\n* [[Barry Pearl]] as Doody\n* [[Michael Tucci]] as Sonny LaTierri\n* [[Kelly Ward]] as Putzie\n\n==== Pink Ladies ====\n* [[Stockard Channing]] as Betty Rizzo\n* [[Didi Conn]] as Frenchy\n* [[Jamie Donnelly]] as Jan\n* [[Dinah Manoff]] as Marty Maraschino\n\n=== Secondary cast ===\n==== Students ====\n* [[Eddie Deezen]] as Eugene Felsnic\n* [[Susan Buckner]] as Patricia \"Patty\" Simcox\n* [[Lorenzo Lamas]] as Thomas \"Tom\" Chisum\n* [[Dennis Cleveland Stewart]] as Leo \"[[Acne scarring|Crater-Face]]\" Balmudo\n* [[Annette Charles]] as Charlene \"Cha-Cha\" DiGregorio\n\n==== School staff ====\n* [[Eve Arden]] as Principal McGee\n* [[Dody Goodman]] as Blanche Hodel\n* [[Sid Caesar]] as Coach Vince Calhoun\n* [[Alice Ghostley]] as Mrs. Murdock\n* [[Darrell Zwerling]] as Mr. Lynch\n* Dick Patterson as Mr. Rudie\n* [[Fannie Flagg]] as Nurse Wilkins\n\n==== Others ====\n* [[Joan Blondell]] as Vi\n* [[Frankie Avalon]] as Teen Angel\n* [[Edd Byrnes]] as Vince Fontaine\n* [[Johnny Contardo]] and [[Sha Na Na]] as Johnny Casino & The Gamblers\n* [[Ellen Travolta]] as a Frosty Palace waitress\n\n==Production==\nDirector [[Randal Kleiser]] took numerous liberties with the original source material, most notably moving the setting from an urban [[Chicago]] setting (based on [[William Howard Taft High School (Chicago)|William Howard Taft High School]]<ref>{{Cite web|last=WOULFE|first=MOLLY|title='Grease' has deep, dark Chicago roots|url=https://www.nwitimes.com/entertainment/columnists/molly-woulfe/grease-has-deep-dark-chicago-roots/article_4ca30af9-cb0c-575a-b834-db637918bb3d.html|access-date=2021-10-20|website=nwitimes.com|language=en}}</ref>), as the original musical had been, to a more suburban locale, reflecting his own teenage years at [[Radnor High School]] in the suburbs of Philadelphia.<ref name=radnor/> He had little control over the musical aspects of the film; his choice of theme song, a composition by [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]] and [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]], was overruled when [[Robert Stigwood]] and [[Allan Carr]] commissioned a song from Stigwood's client [[Barry Gibb]] at the last minute, which displeased Kleiser.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fox |first=Charles |title=Killing Me Softly: My Life in Music |year=2010 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |location=Lanham, Maryland |isbn=9780810869929 |oclc=678101101}}</ref><ref name=\"time\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/78.html|title=Gibb Songs : 1978|website=www.columbia.edu}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[John Travolta]] had previously worked with Stigwood on ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', recorded the top-10 hit \"[[Let Her In]]\" in 1976, and had previously appeared as Doody in a touring production of the stage version of ''Grease''. He made a number of casting recommendations that Stigwood ultimately accepted, including suggesting Kleiser (who had never directed a theatrical feature before this but had directed Travolta in the 1976 telefilm ''[[The Boy in the Plastic Bubble]]'') as director, and [[Olivia Newton-John]], then known almost exclusively as a multiple Grammy winning pop and country singer, as Sandy. Newton-John had done little acting before this film, with only two film credits (1965's ''[[Funny Things Happen Down Under]]'' and the little-seen 1970 film ''[[Toomorrow (film)|Toomorrow]]'', which predated her singing breakthrough) to her name up to that time. Before accepting the role, Newton-John requested a [[screen test]] for ''Grease'' to avoid another career setback.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20071391,00.html |title=Ohh Sandy! \u2013 Olivia Newton-John |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |first=Robert |last=Windeler |date=July 31, 1978 |access-date=November 10, 2008 |archive-date=December 2, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202163225/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20071391,00.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The screen test was done with the drive-in movie scene.
