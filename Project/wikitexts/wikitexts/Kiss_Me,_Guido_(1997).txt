He works in a pizza parlor but, inspired by the likes of [[Al Pacino]] and [[Robert De Niro]], he wants to be an actor. After catching his fianc\u00e9e ([[Jennifer Esposito]]) cheating on him with his brother, Frankie decides the time has come to move out and pursue his dream.\n\nHe starts by checking the classifieds for roommate ads. He finds an ad from a \"GWM.\" In classified-speak this stands for \"[[gay]] white male\" but Frankie and his friend Joey ([[Domenick Lombardozzi]]) interpret it as \"guy with money.\"\n\nThe GWM in question is Warren (Barrile), an actor who's recently broken up with his director boyfriend. Frankie and Warren each have some initial misgivings - Frankie over Warren's being gay, Warren over Frankie's being a \"[[Guido (slang)|Guido]]\" or [[ethnic stereotype|stereotypical]] [[Italian American]] \u2013 but Warren lets Frankie move in.\n\nWarren's ex, Dakota ([[Christopher Lawford]]), returns and offers Warren a part in his new play. Warren initially accepts but after being injured in an attempted [[gay bashing]], has to withdraw. Frankie replaces him, but the part involves a same-sex kiss, which makes him nervous. At the premiere Frankie gives a good performance (although he hesitates on the kiss, leading his scene partner to hiss \"Kiss me, Guido!\") for an audience that includes his family, who come to understand and accept his decision to become an actor.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nick Scotti]] as Frankie\n* [[Anthony Barrile]] as Warren\n* [[Anthony DeSando]] as Pino\n* [[Craig Chester]] as Terry\n* [[Domenick Lombardozzi]] as Joey Chips\n* [[Molly Price]] as Meryl\n* [[Christopher Lawford]] as Dakota\n* [[David Deblinger]] as Stage Actor\t\n* John Tormey as Patsy Zito\n* [[Antonia Rey]] as Josephina Zito\n* [[Jennifer Esposito]] as Debbie\n* [[Anthony Vitale]] as Pizza Guy #1\n* [[Frankie Dellarosa]] as Pizza Guy #2\n* [[Rebecca Waxman]] as Wiggy\n* [[Tony Ray Rossi]] as Vinny the Fish\n\n==Soundtrack==\n* Machine - \"There But for the Grace of God Go I\"\n* Panic Patrol - \"Out of Control\"\n* La Flavour - \"Mandolay\"\n* [[Miquel Brown]] - \"So Many Men, So Little Time\"\n* 3rd Party - \"Can U Feel It\"\n* [[Edwin Starr]] - \"[[Contact (Edwin Starr song)|Contact]]\"\n* Carol Jiani - \"Hit & Run Lover\"\n* [[Martha Wash]] - \"Magic Charms\"\n* [[The Gap Band]] - \"[[Burn Rubber on Me (Why You Wanna Hurt Me)]]\"\n* Nick Scotti - \"I'm Gonna Shout\"\n* Edwin Starr - \"H.A.P.P.Y.
