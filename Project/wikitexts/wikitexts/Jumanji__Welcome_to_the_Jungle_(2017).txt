See \"Wikipedia:How to write a plot summary\" (WP:PLOTSUM) for general guidelines.-->\nIn 1996, Brantford, [[New Hampshire]], teenager Alex Vreeke receives ''Jumanji'', which was previously disposed of by Alan Parrish and Sarah Whittle in 1969,{{efn|As depicted in the 1995 film ''[[Jumanji]]''.}} from his father who discovered it at the coast. Uninterested, Alex sets it aside, only to find it transformed into a [[ROM cartridge|video game cartridge]] later that night. Opting to play the game, he is suddenly sucked inside upon choosing a character. His disappearance results in his father becoming despondent and their home falling into disrepair.\n\nTwenty-one years later in 2017, four Brantford High School students \u2013 awkward Spencer Gilpin, athletic Anthony \"Fridge\" Johnson, ditzy Bethany Walker, and rebellious Martha Kaply \u2013 are sent by Principal Bentley to clean the school's basement for detention \u2013 Bethany for using her phone during a quiz, Martha for insulting the gym teacher, and Spencer and Fridge for the former writing the latter's essay for him. Fridge discovers Alex's discarded video game system, which he and Spencer decide to play and encourage the girls to join them. Upon starting the game, they are sucked into ''Jumanji'', landing in a jungle as their chosen characters \u2013 Spencer as muscular explorer and archaeologist Dr. Xander \"Smolder\" Bravestone, Fridge as diminutive [[zoologist]] Franklin \"Mouse\" Finbar, Bethany as male [[cartography|cartographer]] and [[paleontology|paleontologist]] Professor Sheldon \"Shelly\" Oberon, and Martha as martial arts expert Ruby Roundhouse.\n\nWhile coming to terms with their situation, the group find three marks on their arms denoting lives. Spencer theorizes that if they lose all three, they will permanently expire. The group encounter the game's [[non-player character|NPC]] guide Nigel Billingsly, who provides them with the game's [[narrative]] and their characters' backstories. The group learn that their goal is to end a curse on ''Jumanji'', brought about by corrupt [[archaeologist]] Professor Van Pelt{{efn|name=VanPelt|The character is known as Russell Van Pelt in the US version of the film, and John Hardin Van Pelt in the UK version of the film.}} after he stole a magical jewel called the \"Jaguar's Eye\" from its shrine and gained control of all the jungle's animals, casting a terrible curse upon Jumanji. Nigel hands Spencer the jewel, having stolen it from Van Pelt, and before driving off he instructs the group to return it to a statue at the shrine and call out \"Jumanji\" to lift the curse and leave the game.\n\nCoping with their avatars, their \"weaknesses\", Van Pelt's men, and Spencer and Fridge's animosity towards each other for the former inadvertently costing the latter his place in their school's football team, the group encounter Alex operating the fifth avatar \u2013 pilot Jefferson \"Seaplane\" McDonough \u2013 who takes them to a treehouse that Alan Parrish built during his tenure in Jumanji after saving them from Van Pelt's men. Upon realizing his identity, the group is collectively shocked upon learning how long he has been trapped in the game, although Alex thought he'd only been there a few months. Now with a common goal, the group vows to help Alex return home with them.\n\nDealing with further problems while heading for the shrine, the group coordinate to overcome them. They eventually reach the shrine, but Van Pelt corners them. Working together, Fridge, Bethany, and Alex distract him while Spencer and Martha outmaneuver him with the game's mechanics, returning the jewel to the statue. Upon calling out Jumanji, the group destroy Van Pelt and, after sharing a handshake with Nigel, return to the real world.\n\nReturning to the school basement, the foursome find Alex is not with them. While walking home, they unexpectedly find the Vreeke home restored and decorated for a Christmas family gathering. The group is greeted by Alex, now an adult, who explains that he managed to miraculously return to 1996, which allowed him to lead a married life with two children. He has a son named Andy and his daughter is named after Bethany as a thank you when she revived him with one of her lives in the game. The four students become friends after their experiences in the game, with Bethany becoming a better person, Spencer and Fridge patching things up, and Spencer starting a relationship with Martha. Later, they destroy the game by dropping a bowling ball they found earlier on it to prevent it from endangering anyone else.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- PER TALK PAGE DISCUSSION - DO NOT CHANGE THIS CAST WITHOUT CONSULTING THE TALK PAGE FIRST -->\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as Dr. Xander \"Smolder\" Bravestone, a strong, confident [[archaeologist]] and explorer, and Spencer's avatar in ''Jumanji''.\n** [[Alex Wolff]] as Spencer Gilpin, an intelligent, unconfident and neurotic high school student.\n* [[Kevin Hart]] as Franklin \"Mouse\" Finbar, a diminutive [[zoologist]] and weapons carrier, and Fridge's avatar in ''Jumanji''.\n** [[Ser'Darius Blain]] as Anthony \"Fridge\" Johnson, a high school football player whose friendship with Spencer has deteriorated due to their different social statuses.\n* [[Jack Black]] as Professor Sheldon \"Shelly\" Oberon, an expert in many [[Science|scientific fields]] and Bethany's avatar in ''Jumanji''.\n** [[Madison Iseman]] as Bethany Walker, a popular and vain high school student.\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as Ruby Roundhouse, a scantily-clad [[commando]] and Martha's avatar in ''Jumanji''.\n** [[Morgan Turner]] as Martha Kaply, a quiet and shy high school student with a cynical intellect. \n* [[Nick Jonas]] as Jefferson \"Seaplane\" McDonough, an [[aircraft pilot]] and Alex's avatar in ''Jumanji''.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/06/29/jumanji-welcome-to-the-jungle-trailer/ |title=Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black go wild in first ''Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle'' trailer |last=Coggan |first=Devan |date=June 29, 2017 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=June 29, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629145040/http://ew.com/movies/2017/06/29/jumanji-welcome-to-the-jungle-trailer/ |archivedate=June 29, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n** [[Colin Hanks]] as Alex Vreeke, a family man who was trapped in ''Jumanji'' as a teenager (uncredited.)\n*** Mason Guccione as young Alex\n* [[Rhys Darby]] as Nigel Billingsley, a [[non-player character]] in ''Jumanji'' who serves as the primary guide for its players\n* [[Bobby Cannavale]] as Van Pelt,{{efn|name=VanPelt|The character is known as Russell Van Pelt in the US version of the film, and John Hardin Van Pelt in the UK version of the film.}} a non-player character in ''Jumanji'' presented as a corrupt archaeologist and former partner of Bravestone's.

As reported by [[Ain't It Cool News]], a [[stand-alone sequel]] entitled ''Jumanji 2'' was in development in 1999. The plot of the story involved John Cooper, the [[President of the United States]], buying Jumanji from an old antique store in [[Europe]] and bringing it to the [[White House]] to play it with his children (one of whom, Butch, just wants a dad not a President for a father). Cooper then gets sucked into the world of Jumanji, paving the way for his evil [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], who was supposed to be played by [[Steve Buscemi]], to rise to power as Cooper's replacement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.aintitcool.com/node/3998|title=Who's playing the 'evil Vice-President' in JUMANJI 2'|work=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|access-date=February 25, 2019|date=July 20, 1999}}</ref> Inside the game, Cooper would have teamed up with [[hybrid animal]]s, which were going to be animated with [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]; Sony Pictures Consumer Products executive VP of worldwide consumer products Peter Dang revealed prototype drawings of animals that may have appeared in the film, all designed by [[Ken Ralston]], who served as visual effects supervisor in the original film and was planned to make his [[directorial debut]] with ''Jumanji 2'', slated for a [[Christmas]] 2000 release date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/1999/08/01/26272-19990801/|title=Wild hybrids for Jumanji 2|work=Kidscreen|last=Robertson|first=Virginia|access-date=February 25, 2019|date=August 1, 1999}}</ref> The first film's co-writer, [[Jonathan Hensleigh]], had written the initial draft.
