The film stars [[Eric Stoltz]] and [[Daphne Zuniga]], and is a sequel to the 1986 film ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'', itself a [[Film remake|remake]] of the [[The Fly (1958 film)|1958 film of the same name]]. Stoltz's character in this sequel is the adult son of Veronica Quaife and Seth Brundle, a scientist who became a human-fly hybrid as a result of an experiment gone awry, played by [[Jeff Goldblum]] in the 1986 remake. With the exception of stock footage of Goldblum from the first film, [[John Getz]] was the only actor to reprise his role, with another actress filling the [[Geena Davis]] role as Quaife in the opening birth scene. Unlike the [[The Fly (1986 film)|previous film]], this film received negative reviews.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nSeveral months after the events of ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'', Veronica Quaife gives birth to a larval sac and dies. The sac splits open to reveal a seemingly normal baby boy. Anton Bartok, the owner of the company that financed Seth Brundle's original teleportation experiments, adopts the child and names him Martin. Martin grows up in a clinical environment, tested and examined by Dr. Jainway and Dr. Shepard, two scientists under Bartok's employ. Martin's physical and mental maturity is highly accelerated, and he possesses a genius-level intellect, incredible reflexes, and no need for sleep. He knows he is aging faster than a normal human, but is unaware of the true cause, having been told his father died from the same rapid aging disease.\n\nAt age three, Martin has the physique of a 10-year-old and frequently sneaks around to explore the Bartok complex. He finds a room containing laboratory animals and befriends a dog. The next night, he brings it food but finds it missing. He enters an observation booth overlooking Bay 17. There, scientists have reassembled Brundle's Telepods, but have been unable to duplicate the programming that enabled them to teleport living subjects.  An attempt to teleport the dog fails, leaving it horribly deformed. It maims one of the scientists, horrifying young Martin. Two years later, Martin's body has matured to that of a 25-year-old young man. On his fifth birthday, Bartok presents Martin with a [[bungalow]] on the Bartok facility's property. He also offers Martin a job: repair his father's Telepods. He apologizes about the dog and assures Martin that its suffering was brief. When Martin is uneasy about the proposition, Bartok shows him Veronica Quaife's videotapes, which documented Seth Brundle's progress with the Telepods. Seeing his father describe how the Telepods ostensibly improved and energized his body, Martin accepts Bartok's proposal.\n\nAs he works on the Telepods, Martin befriends an employee, Beth Logan. Beth invites Martin to a party at the specimens division, where he learns that the mutated dog is still kept alive and studied. Thinking Beth is aware of the dog's imprisonment, Martin argues with her, leaves the party, and goes to the animal's holding pen. The deformed dog, in terrible pain, still remembers Martin (recognizing him despite his growth), and he tearfully euthanizes it with [[chloroform]]. Martin reconciles with Beth and arrives at his father's \"eureka\" moment when he realizes the Telepods' computer need to be creative to analyze living flesh. Martin shows Beth his perfected Telepods by teleporting a kitten without harm. They become lovers, but Martin shows signs of his eventual mutation into a human-fly hybrid. Martin devises a potential cure for his condition, which involves swapping out his mutated genes for healthy human genes. Martin shelves this idea when he realizes the other person would be subject to a grotesque genetic disfigurement.\n\nEventually, Martin learns that Bartok has hidden cameras in his bungalow. Martin breaks into Bartok's records room, where he learns of his father's true fate. Bartok confronts Martin and explains that he is aware of and has been waiting for his inevitable mutation. Bartok reveals his plan to use Martin's body and the Telepods' potential for genetic manipulation for profit. Martin's insect genes fully awaken and his transformation into a human-insect hybrid begins, and he escapes from Bartok Industries. Bartok is unable to use the Telepods, as they are locked by a password. Martin also installed a computer virus which will erase the Telepods' programming if the wrong password is entered. Bartok orders a search for Martin.\n\nMartin goes to Beth and explains the situation, and the two flee. They visit Veronica Quaife's old confidant, Stathis Borans (implied to have been told that Brundle's baby died in childbirth along with Veronica), who informs Martin that Seth Brundle died after trying to drag Veronica into the Telepod with him, and Veronica killed Seth with a shotgun. Stathis\nconfirms for Martin that the Telepods are his only chance for a cure, and he gives Beth and Martin his vehicle to aid their escape. Martin and Beth keep running, but Martin's physical and emotional changes become too much for Beth to handle, and she eventually surrenders them both to Bartok. Without revealing the password, Martin becomes enveloped in a cocoon. Bartok interrogates Beth for the password. \n\nShortly after, the fully-transformed Martin emerges from his cocoon and rampages through the Bartok facility, killing several members of Bartok's scientific staff (including Shepard and Jainway) as well as Bartok's security personnel. Martin breaks into Bay 17 and kills Scorby, Bartok's chief of security. Martin grabs Bartok, forces him to type in the computer password, \"Dad\", and drags Bartok and himself into a Telepod. Martin gestures Beth to activate the gene-swapping sequence, and Beth complies. When he and Bartok emerge, Martin is restored to a fully human form while Bartok is revealed to have been transformed into a deformed monstrosity. Bartok ends up kept in the same enclosure as the mutated dog; as he begins to eat swill from the dog\u2019s dish, Bartok catches sight of a single [[housefly]] sitting on the dish\u2019s edge.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Eric Stoltz]] as Martin Brundle \n** [[Harley Cross]] as 10 year old Martin<br>(age 3, but advanced body)\n* [[Daphne Zuniga]] as Beth Logan\n* [[Lee Richardson (actor)|Lee Richardson]] as Anton Bartok\n* [[Garry Chalk]] as Scorby\n* Ann Marie Lee as Jainway\n* [[Frank C.
