Two church elders accuse a young woman ([[Claire Foy]]) of being a witch responsible for the plague. They command the two knights to transport her to a distant monastery so the monks can lift her curse.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=49078 | title=Season of the Witch | publisher=[[ComingSoon.net]] | access-date=January 4, 2011 }}</ref> The film reunited Sena and Cage, who had previously worked together on ''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)|Gone in 60 Seconds]]''.\n\nDevelopment on the film began in 2000 when the [[spec script]] by screenwriter Bragi F. Schut was purchased by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]. The project moved from MGM to [[Columbia Pictures]] to [[Relativity Media]], where the film was finally produced by [[Charles Roven]] and Alex Gartner. Filming took place primarily in [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], and [[Croatia]]. ''Season of the Witch'' was released on January 7, 2011, in the United States, Canada, and several other territories.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Villach]] in the 13th century, three women are accused by a priest of [[witchcraft]]. The first confesses in an attempt to earn mercy. The second claims she made ointments but not magic potions. The third, a hag with a blind eye, does not deny the charge and curses the priest. All three are first hanged and then drowned. The priest pulls the three hanged corpses from the water for a religious ritual so they can never return to life. The priest performs the ritual on each using ''The [[Key of Solomon]]''. The first shows no sign of life. The hag's body vomits and twitches violently. The third corpse, the woman who had claimed to be an ointment maker, takes on a demonic appearance, sets the book on fire, and hangs the priest.\n\nIn the 14th century, German [[Teutonic Knights]] Sir Behmen von Bleibruck and Sir Felson join crusades throughout the 1330s (1332 Gulf of Edremit, 1334 Siege of Tripoli, 1337 Imbros, and 1339 Artah), eventually joining the [[Smyrniote crusades]]. After witnessing a civilian massacre during the 1344 capture of [[Smyrna]], the two abandon their knightly order and return to Austria.\n\nTraveling through [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]] in Austria, Behmen and Felson encounter the sight of those infected with the Black Death, learning that the plague has swept the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Trying to conceal their identities as deserters, Behmen's known sword crest reveals that they are crusader knights. They are arrested and taken to [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] D'Ambroise, who is near death from the plague. The Cardinal asks the knights to escort an alleged witch, suspected of causing the pestilence, to a remote monastery, where a group of monks can determine if she is truly a witch. If found guilty, they can perform a sacred ritual to cancel her powers and stop the plague. Both knights agree under the condition that she be given a fair trial and the charges of desertion against them be dropped. The Cardinal agrees, and they are accompanied by the priest Debelzaq; the altar boy, Kay von Wollenbarth, who wants to become a knight like his deceased father; another knight, Sir Johann Eckhardt, whose family was killed by the Black Death; finally Hagamar, a well-traveled [[swindler]], who will serve as their guide in return for his pardon. The young woman Anna from [[Maribor|Marburg]] shows hatred towards Debelzaq, while forming a connection with Behmen.\n\nThe group camp for the night and Johann takes first watch. When Debelzaq comes to relieve him, Johann says how much she reminds him of his dead daughter. He then goes on to speak of the ritual politics of her coming trial and how she can never be found ''not guilty'' by the Church with a plague curse everywhere. Johann decides to give up the mission and to convince the others to do the same, leaving Anna alone with Debelzaq. Anna becomes hysterical at the prospect of being left with him. She attacks and grabs his key to her cage and escapes. The search for her leads the group to a mass grave, where Johann begins having visions of his dead daughter calling to him. Chasing those visions, he accidentally impales himself on Kay's drawn sword and dies. When Anna is recaptured, the tearful young woman explains that she only ran away for fear of Debelzaq. They cross an old, crumbling suspension bridge, where Anna saves Kay from falling, grabbing him with unnatural strength. The group enters the dark forest, Wormwood, where Hagamar attempts to kill Anna, only to be stopped by the others. Anna appears to summon packs of wolves, which chase the group and kill Hagamar. An enraged Behmen tries to kill her but is stopped by Debelzaq and Felson, who point to their destination on a nearby summit.\n\nAt the monastery, the men discover that all the monks have succumbed to the plague. They locate the ancient volume, ''The Key of Solomon'', filled with the holy rituals used to defeat evil. Debelzaq begins speaking the ritual used on witches. In a deep voice, Anna begins recounting Behmen's horror of Crusader cruelties, just as Debelzaq realizes that she is not a witch, but has been possessed by a demon. He frantically performs an [[exorcism]]. The demon that is [[demonic possession|possessing]] Anna finally reveals its form and melts the cage's metal, escaping, while fighting off the knights. When Debelzaq throws a container of [[holy water]] on it, the demon flies screeching out of sight. As the men search for it, they realize it is not trying to escape, but to destroy the book so that nothing can kill it. They find a room where the monks were making copies for others to use. The demon destroys the copies and possesses the dead monks to use as weapons. The three men fight the monks' possessed corpses, as Debelzaq continues the exorcism ritual. The demon snaps Debelzaq's neck and incinerates Felson. Kay continues the ritual, weakening it. Behmen fights the demon and is mortally wounded by it. Kay finishes the ritual, and the demon is consumed by holy fire. Behmen asks Kay to keep Anna safe just before he dies. After their fallen friends are buried, Anna asks Kay to tell her about the men who saved her. They both leave the monastery, the ''Book of Solomon'' safely in Kay's possession for mankind to use against the forces of evil.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Behmen von Bleibruck\n* [[Ron Perlman]] as Felson\n* [[Robert Sheehan]] as Kay von Wollenbarth\n* [[Claire Foy]] as Anna\n* [[Stephen Campbell Moore]] as Debelzaq\n* [[Ulrich Thomsen]] as Johann Eckhardt\n* [[Stephen Graham]] as Hagamar\n* [[Christopher Lee]] as Cardinal D'Ambroise\n* [[Simone Kirby]] as Midwife in Villach\n* [[Nick Sidi]] as Priest in Villach\n* [[Rory McCann]] as Soldier Commander in Villach\n* Matt Devere as Sergeant in Arms\n* [[Br\u00edan F.

The filmmakers requested an entity \"lithe and feminine\", and the visual effects crew designed a demon that had \"cloven feet, a dog ankle, and a fawn leg\". Designing visual effects for the demon's wings was the biggest challenge since wings tend to get in the way or do not move convincingly. The filmmakers also requested holes in the demon's wings. The crew designed holes that appeared worn instead of ripped, since ripped holes would require an added billowing effect.<ref name=\"awn\">{{cite news | last=Desowitz | first=Bill | url=http://www.awn.com/articles/article/demonizing-season-witch | title=Demonizing ''Season of the Witch'' | work=awn.com | publisher=Animation World Network | date=January 11, 2011 | access-date=January 12, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe demon was also designed to have dark gray skin, which presented the crew a challenge in the film's dark settings. Tippett's Blair Clark said, \"We played the skin like a rotten mummy: nothing too moist, with a lot of wear marks on it\". The crew's final visual effects shot was the death of the demon, and they researched previous films and terminology for how demons' deaths have been designed. They drew inspiration from ''[[Hellboy (2004 film)|Hellboy]]'' (2004), where they focused on the buildup to the demon's death. Clark said, \"We built it over a series of shots so it doesn't just happen in one shot.
