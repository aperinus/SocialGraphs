It is based on the book ''Stray Dogs'' by [[John Ridley]], who also wrote the screenplay.\n\n==Plot==\nBobby Cooper is a [[wikt:drifter|drifter]] in debt to a violent gangster when his car breaks down in [[Superior, Arizona]]. Stranded and broke, he meets Jake and Grace McKenna, a father and his stepdaughter who are also a married couple. They separately approach Bobby to kill the other for money.\n\nDesperate and in fear, Bobby approaches Jake about killing Grace. He becomes [[sexual attraction|attracted]] to Grace and agrees to kill Jake, then he and Grace can be together and use Jake's money for a new start somewhere else.\n\nWith Grace's help, Bobby kills Jake, and they leave together with [[United States dollar|$]]200,000. As they make their way out of Superior, the Sheriff, with whom Grace has been having an affair, stops them. Grace shoots and kills the sheriff. As they dump the bodies, Grace pushes Bobby over the cliff, severely injuring him. Grace suddenly realizes that Bobby has the car keys.\n\nGrace makes her way down the steep incline where she and Bobby fight, and in his weakened, injured state, Bobby kills Grace, but she also shoots him in the belly. He makes the grueling journey back up the cliff with a broken leg, then starts the car, but the radiator hose bursts, and Bobby is stranded in the heat, injured and dying.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Penn]] as Bobby Cooper\n* [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Grace McKenna\n* [[Nick Nolte]] as Jake McKenna\n* [[Powers Boothe]] as Sheriff Virgil Potter\n* [[Claire Danes]] as Jenny\n* [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as Toby N. \"TNT\" Tucker\n* [[Jon Voight]] as Blind Indian\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Darrell\n* [[Abraham Benrubi]] as Biker #1\n* [[Sean Stone]] as Boy In Grocery Store\n* [[Ilia Volok]] as Sergei\n* [[Valery Nikolaev]] as Mr. Arkady\n* [[Brent Briscoe]] as Ed\n* [[Bo Hopkins]] as Boyd\n* [[Julie Hagerty]] as Flo\n* [[Sheri Foster]] as Grace's Mother\n* [[Liv Tyler]] as Girl In Bus Station (Cameo)\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as Bus Station Ticket Attendant\n\n==Production==\n''U Turn'' was filmed during November 1996\u2013January 1997 on location in [[Superior, Arizona]] and other areas of [[Arizona]] and [[California]], including the [[Coachella Valley]].<ref name=Filming>{{cite web |title=Coachella Valley Feature Film Production 1920\u20132011 |url=http://www.visitpalmsprings.com/page/filming-in-palm-springs/126939 |work=Filming in Palm Springs |access-date=October 1, 2012 |author=Palm Springs Visitors Center |location=Palm Springs, CA |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305201810/http://www.visitpalmsprings.com/page/filming-in-palm-springs/126939 |archive-date=March 5, 2016 }} \u2666 [http://visitpalmsprings.com/stream/126941?mode=Download Download] {{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ([[Portable Document Format|Downloadable PDF file]])</ref> It was filmed entirely on Reversal stock, 5239, to give an extra harsh look to the hostile environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehollywoodinterview.blogspot.com/2008/03/oliver-stone-hollywood-interview.html |title=The Hollywood Interview: Oliver Stone: The Hollywood Interview |publisher=Thehollywoodinterview.blogspot.com |access-date=2015-09-30}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nFor the Toby N.
