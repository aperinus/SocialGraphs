The film is about an alleged 1990 murder in the village of [[Munnsville, New York|Munnsville]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>[https://www.criterionchannel.com/sundance-class-of-92-the-year-indie-exploded/season:1/videos/brother-s-keeper Brother's Keeper - Sundance Class of '92: The Year Indie Exploded - The Criterion Channel]</ref> The film is in the \"[[Direct Cinema]]\" style of the [[Albert and David Maysles|Maysles brothers]], who had formerly employed Berlinger and Sinofsky.\n\n==Summary==\nThe film contrasts two groups of society: people from rural areas and those from larger cities. It also shows how the media flocked to the town to cover the story.\n\nThis film displays two completely opposite views of the Ward brothers. One opinion is that of the locals, who defend the Ward brothers as simple country folk. The other is that of the press, who stereotype the brothers as poor, uneducated [[Hillbilly|hill people]].\n\nThe Ward sister was not featured in this film because of her death in the 1980s. However, her daughter Pat makes an appearance in the DVD's special features.\n\n==Production==\nAfter its theatrical run, ''Brother's Keeper'' aired on [[PBS]] as part of the series ''[[American Playhouse]]''.<ref>{{Cite web| title = PBS AIRING CREEPY DOCUMENTARY OF TRIAL| website= DeseretNews.com| access-date = 2019-03-02| date = 1994-05-02| url = https://www.deseretnews.com/article/350910/PBS-AIRING-CREEPY-DOCUMENTARY-OF-TRIAL.html}}</ref>\n\n===The Ward Boys===\nIn a rural farming community near [[Utica, New York]], four brothers lived in a dilapidated house. The brothers were Roscoe (July 23, 1919 \u2013 June 23, 2007),<ref>{{cite web|title=Roscoe Ward|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=18743511|website=Find a Grave|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref> Lyman George (July 7, 1923 \u2013 August 15, 2007),<ref>{{cite web|title=Lyman George Ward|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=18743563|website=Find a Grave|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref> William Jay (July 10, 1926 \u2013 June 6, 1990),<ref>{{cite web|title=William Jay Ward|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=18743654|website=Find a Grave|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref> and Adelbert Daniel (known as Delbert) (October 5, 1930 \u2013 August 6, 1998).<ref>{{cite web|title=Adelbert Daniel \"Delbert\" Ward|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=18743603|website=Find a Grave|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref> The men were barely literate, had no formal education, and farmed land that had been in their family for generations.\n\n===William's death===\nWilliam Ward, who had been ill for years, was found dead one morning.  Delbert was accused of killing him, perhaps by smothering. The prosecution's theory at trial was that Delbert had performed a [[mercy killing]] in order to put William out of his misery after a period of severe headaches and declining health. As the film progresses, it is revealed that during the coroner's examination of William's body, [[semen]] was found on clothing and on William's leg, leading to the suggestion that Delbert had killed William in an episode of \"sex gone bad.\" The film never follows up on this media sensation.\n\nDelbert Ward was acquitted at trial, largely because the lack of any physical evidence and that the [[New York State Police]] violated Delbert's rights by coercing a confession (which he later retracted) and by having him sign a written statement which he could not understand due to illiteracy.\n\n===The brothers' fates===\nDelbert Ward died at age 67 at Bassett Hospital in [[Cooperstown, New York]] on August 6, 1998.<ref>[http://www.rootsweb.com/~nymadiso/bit-of-past/borg/moadwar1.htm Adelbert Ward obituary].
