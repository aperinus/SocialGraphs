The French-language film stars [[Fernando Rey]], [[St\u00e9phane Audran]], [[Jean-Pierre Cassel]], [[Paul Frankeur]], [[Delphine Seyrig]], [[Bulle Ogier]], [[Julien Bertheau]], and [[Milena Vukotic]].\n\nThe film consists of several thematically linked scenes: five gatherings of a group of bourgeois friends, and the four dreams of different characters. The beginning of the film focuses on the gatherings, while the latter part focuses on the dreams, but both types of scenes are intertwined. There are also scenes involving other characters, such as two involving a Latin American female [[terrorism|terrorist]] from the fictional [[List of fictional countries|Republic of Miranda]]. The film's world is not [[logic]]al: the bizarre events are accepted by the characters, even if they are impossible or contradictory.\n\nBu\u00f1uel plays tricks on his characters, luring them toward fine dinners that they expect, and then repeatedly frustrating them in inventive ways. They bristle, and politely express their outrage, but they never stop trying; they relentlessly expect and pursue all that they desire, as though it were their natural right to have others serve and pamper them. He exposes their sense of entitlement, their hypocrisy, and their corruption. In the dream sequences, he explores their intense fears\u2014not just of public humiliation, but of being caught by police and of being mowed down by guns. At least one character's dream sequence is later revealed to be nested, or embedded, in another character's dream sequence. As the dreams-within-dreams unfold, it appears that Bu\u00f1uel is also playing tricks on his audience as they try to make sense of the story.\n\nThe film was both a critical and commercial success. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]],<ref name=\"Oscars1973\">{{Cite web|title=The 45th Academy Awards (1973) Nominees and Winners|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1973|access-date=30 November 2011|work=oscars.org}}</ref> and [[BAFTA Awards]] for [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] (Audran) and [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] (Bu\u00f1uel, Carri\u00e8re).\n\n==Plot==\nA [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] couple, Fran\u00e7ois and Simone Th\u00e9venot, accompany Fran\u00e7ois's colleague Don Rafael Acosta, the ambassador from the South American nation of Miranda, and Simone's sister Florence, to the house of the S\u00e9n\u00e9chals, the hosts of a dinner party. Once they arrive, Alice S\u00e9n\u00e9chal is surprised to see them and explains that she expected them the following evening and has no dinner prepared. The would-be guests then invite Alice to join them for dinner at a nearby inn.\n\nArriving at the inn, the party finds it locked. They knock and are reluctantly invited in by a waitress who mentions that the restaurant is under new management. Inside, there are no diners, and the prices on the menu are disconcertingly low. The party hears wailing from an adjoining room and discovers a vigil for the corpse of the manager, who died a few hours earlier. The party is told that the coroner is coming soon, but they hurriedly depart.\n\nLater, at the Embassy of Miranda, Acosta meets with Fran\u00e7ois and Alice's husband Henri to discuss the proceeds of a large cocaine deal. During the meeting, Acosta sees a young woman selling clockwork-animal toys on the footpath outside the embassy. He shoots one of the toys with a rifle and the woman runs off. He explains that she is part of a [[Maoist]] Mirandan terrorist group that's been targeting him for months.\n\nTwo days later, the bourgeois friends attempt to have lunch at the S\u00e9n\u00e9chals', but Henri and his wife escape to the garden to have sex instead of joining them. One of the friends take their unexplained absence this to mean that the S\u00e9n\u00e9chals know the police are coming and left to avoid arrest for their involvement in drug trafficking. The party again leaves in a panic.\n\nWhen the S\u00e9n\u00e9chals return from the garden, their friends are gone, but they meet a bishop who has donned their gardener's clothing. They throw him out, but when he returns wearing his bishop's robes, they embrace him with deference. The bishop asks to work for them as their gardener. He tells them about his childhood \u2014 that his parents were murdered by [[arsenic poisoning]] and that the culprit was never apprehended. (Later in the film, he goes to visit a dying man who turns out to be his parents' murderer; after blessing the man, the bishop kills him with a shotgun.)\n\nThe women visit a [[teahouse]] just as it has run out of all beverages \u2013 tea, coffee, and milk \u2013 although it finally turns out they do have water. While they are waiting, a soldier tells them about his childhood: how after his mother's death his cold-hearted father sent him to military school. The ghost of the soldier's mother informed him that the man was not his real father, but his father's killer; they had dueled over his mother. Following the ghost's request, the soldier killed the culprit with poison.\n\nSimone meets Acosta at his apartment. They are having an affair but are interrupted by a visit from her husband, whereupon she makes a convenient excuse and leaves with him. Acosta is next visited by the same terrorist from earlier, who has come to kill him. He ambushes and chastises her, then tells her to leave when she refuses his sexual advances; his agents capture her and take her away.\n\nSeveral abortive dinner parties ensue; interruptions include the arrival of a group of army officers and enlisted men who join the dinner only to be called away for alarmingly close military maneuvers, the revelation that a colonel's dining room is a stage set in a theatrical performance for an audience that is angry with the actors for not knowing their lines, the ambassador's shooting of the colonel after he insults the nation of Miranda and slaps the ambassador, the arrest and release of the bourgeois friends, and their [[summary execution]] by the terrorists. Most if not all of these scenes turn out to be dream sequences in which ghosts make frequent appearances.\n\nA recurring scene throughout the film, of the six people walking silently and purposefully on a long, isolated country road, is also the final sequence.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Fernando Rey]] as Rafael Acosta\n* [[Paul Frankeur]] as Fran\u00e7ois Th\u00e9venot\n* [[Delphine Seyrig]] as Simone Th\u00e9venot\n* [[Bulle Ogier]] as Florence Th\u00e9venot\n* [[St\u00e9phane Audran]] as Alice S\u00e9n\u00e9chal\n* [[Jean-Pierre Cassel]] as Henri S\u00e9n\u00e9chal\n*[[Julien Bertheau]] as [[Monsignor]] Dufour, the Bishop\n*[[Milena Vukotic]] as In\u00e8s, the S\u00e9n\u00e9chals' maid\n*[[Claude Pi\u00e9plu]] as the Colonel\n*Maria Gabriella Maione as the female terrorist\n*[[Marguerite Muni|Muni]] as the peasant\n*[[Michel Piccoli]] as the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]]\n*[[Pierre Maguelon]] as [[Brigadier]] Sanglant\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Maistre]] as [[Commissaire de police|Commissaire]] Delecluze\n*[[Jacques Rispal]] as the [[Gendarmerie|Gendarme]]\n*Christian Baltauss as Lt.

''World Film Directors, Volume 1''. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1987, p. 88.</ref>\nbecause he felt he was repeating himself, [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]] met with screenwriter [[Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re]] and discussed the topic of repetition. Shortly afterwards, Bu\u00f1uel met with film producer [[Serge Silberman]], who told him an anecdote about having forgotten about a dinner party and being surprised to find six hungry friends show up at his front door. Bu\u00f1uel was suddenly inspired, and Silberman agreed to give him a $2,000 advance to write a new script with Carri\u00e8re, combining Silberman's anecdote with the idea of repetition. Bu\u00f1uel and Carri\u00e8re wrote the first draft in three weeks and finished the fifth draft by the Summer of 1971, originally titled ''Bourgeois Enchantment''. Silberman was finally able to raise the money for the film in April 1972, and Bu\u00f1uel began pre-production.<ref>Baxter, John. ''Bu\u00f1uel''. New York: Carroll & Graf Publishers, Inc.. 1994. {{ISBN|0-7867-0506-X}}. p. 299.</ref><ref name=\"Wakeman. pp. 88-89\">Wakeman, pp. 88-89.</ref>\n\nBu\u00f1uel cast many actors whom he had worked with in the past, such as [[Fernando Rey]] and [[Michel Piccoli]], and catered their roles to their personalities. He had more difficulty casting the female leads and allowed actresses [[Delphine Seyrig]] and [[St\u00e9phane Audran]] to choose which parts they would like to play, before changing the script to better suit the actresses. [[Jean-Pierre Cassel]] auditioned for his role and was surprised when Bu\u00f1uel cast him after simply glancing at him once.<ref>Baxter, p. 300.</ref>\n\n===Filming and editing===\nFilming began on 15 May 1972, and lasted for two months with an $800,000 budget. In his usual shooting style, Bu\u00f1uel shot few takes and often edited the film in camera and during production. Bu\u00f1uel and Silberman had a long-running and humorous argument as to whether Bu\u00f1uel took one day or one and a half days to edit his films.<ref name=\"Baxter. pp. 301\">Baxter, p. 301.</ref>\n\nOn the advice of Silberman, Bu\u00f1uel used video playback monitors on the set for the first time in his career, resulting in a vastly different style than any of his previous films, including zooms and travelling shots instead of his usual close-ups and static camera framing.<ref name=\"Wakeman. pp. 88-89\"/> It also resulted in Bu\u00f1uel's being more comfortable on set, and in limiting his already minimal direction to technical and physical instructions. This frustrated Cassel, who had never worked with Bu\u00f1uel before, until Rey explained that this was Bu\u00f1uel's usual style and that since they were playing aristocrats their movements and physical appearance were more important than their inner motivation.\n\nBu\u00f1uel once joked that whenever he needed an extra scene he simply filmed one of his own dreams. ''The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie'' includes three of Bu\u00f1uel's recurring dreams: a dream of being on stage and forgetting his lines, a dream of meeting his dead cousin in the street and following him into a house full of cobwebs, and a dream of waking up to see his dead parents staring at him.<ref name=\"Baxter. pp. 301\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was a box office hit in both Europe and the US, and critically praised.<ref name=\"Baxter. pp. 301\"/> [[Roger Ebert]] called it a comedy but noted that Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s comedies were \u201cmore like a dig in the ribs, sly and painful.\u201d<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-discreet-charm-of-the-bourgeoisie-1972|title = The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie|date = 25 June 2000|accessdate = 10 February 2021|last = Ebert|first = Roger|work = [[RogerEbert.com]]}}</ref> [[Robert Benayoun]] said that it was \"perhaps [Bu\u00f1uel's] most direct and most 'public' film\".<ref name=\"Wakeman. pp. 89\">Wakeman, p. 89.</ref> [[Vincent Canby]] wrote in his 1972 review of the film, \u201cIn addition to being extraordinarily funny and perfectly acted, ''The Discreet Charm'' moves with the breathtaking speed and self-assurance that only a man of Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s experience can achieve without resorting to awkward ellipsis.\u201d<ref>Canby, Vincent.  \u201cThe Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie.\u201d ''The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made''.  Ed. Peter M. Nichols.  [New York]: Times Books (Random House), 1999.</ref> Bu\u00f1uel later said that he was disappointed with the analysis that most film critics made of the film.<ref name=\"Wakeman. pp. 89\"/> He also disliked the film's promotional poster, depicting a pair of lips with legs and a derby hat.<ref name=\"Baxter. pp. 301\"/>\n\nBu\u00f1uel and Silberman travelled to the US in late 1972 to promote the film. Bu\u00f1uel did not attend his own press screening in Los Angeles and told a reporter at ''[[Newsweek]]'' that his favorite characters in the film were the cockroaches. While visiting LA, Bu\u00f1uel, Carri\u00e8re and Silberman were invited to a lunch party by Bu\u00f1uel's old friend [[George Cukor]], and other guests included [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Billy Wilder]], [[George Stevens]], [[Rouben Mamoulian]], [[John Ford]], [[William Wyler]], [[Robert Mulligan]] and [[Robert Wise]]<ref name=\"Baxter. pp. 302\">Baxter, p. 302.</ref> (resulting in a famous photograph of the directors together, other than an ailing Ford). [[Fritz Lang]] was unable to attend, but Bu\u00f1uel visited him the following day and received an autographed photo from Lang, one of his favorite directors.<ref>Baxter, pp. 302-03.</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film maintains a rating of 98% based on 57 reviews with the consensus: \"An intoxicating dose of the director's signature surrealist style, ''The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie'' represents Bu\u00f1uel at his most accessible.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie | title=The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|-\n! width=\"25%\" | Award\n! width=\"5%\"| Year\n! width=\"40%\"| Category\n! width=\"20%\"| Nominee\n! width=\"10%\"| Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[45th Academy Awards|1973]]\n| [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]]\n| ''The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie''\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|[[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]\n|Luis Bu\u00f1uel, Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |[[BAFTA Awards|BAFTA Award]]\n| rowspan=\"5\" |[[27th British Academy Film Awards|1974]]\n| [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]]\n|''The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie''\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]]\n| [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|Best Actress]]\n| [[St\u00e9phane Audran]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]\n| Luis Bu\u00f1uel, [[Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[BAFTA Award for Best Sound|Best Sound]]\n|Luis Bu\u00f1uel, Guy Villette\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[French Syndicate of Cinema Critics]]\n|1973\n| Prix M\u00e9li\u00e8s\n| ''The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie''\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]]\n|[[30th Golden Globe Awards|1973]]\n| | [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign-Language Film]]\n| ''The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie''\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Nastro d'Argento]]\n|1974\n| Best Foreign Director\n| Luis Bu\u00f1uel\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|[[National Board of Review]]\n|[[National Board of Review Awards 1972|1972]]\n|Top Foreign Language Films\n|''The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie''\n|{{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[National Society of Film Critics]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[1972 National Society of Film Critics Awards|1972]]\n|[[National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Film|Best Film]]\n|''The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie''\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|[[National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Director|Best Director]]\n|Luis Bu\u00f1uel\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|[[National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|Luis Bu\u00f1uel, Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[New York Film Critics Circle]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[1973 New York Film Critics Circle Awards|1973]]\n|[[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Director|Best Director]]\n|Luis Bu\u00f1uel\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|Luis Bu\u00f1uel, Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|}\n\n===Awards trivia===\nSensing that he had a special film, Silberman decided not to wait until May to premiere it at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and instead released it in the fall of 1972 specifically to make it eligible for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. Bu\u00f1uel was famously indifferent to awards and jokingly told a reporter that he had already paid $25,000 in order to win the Oscar. ''The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie'' did win the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film and Silberman accepted on Bu\u00f1uel's behalf at the ceremony.
