The film stars [[Will Ferrell]], [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]], [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Queen Latifah]], and [[Emma Thompson]]. The main plot follows Harold Crick (Ferrell), an IRS agent who begins hearing a disembodied voice narrating his life as it happens \u2013 seemingly the text of a novel in which it is stated that he, the main character, will soon die \u2013 and he frantically seeks to somehow prevent that ending. The film was shot on location in [[Chicago]], and has been praised for its innovative, intelligent story and fine performances. Ferrell, who came to prominence playing brash comedic parts, garnered particular attention for offering a restrained performance in his first starring dramatic role.\n\n''Stranger than Fiction'' was released by [[Columbia Pictures]] on November 10, 2006. Upon release, the film received positive reviews mainly for its themes, humor, and performances.\n\n==Plot==\nHarold Crick is an [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) [[agent (law)|agent]] and lives a solitary life of strictly scheduled routine. On the day he is assigned to audit an [[tax resistance|intentionally tax-delinquent]] baker named Ana Pascal, Harold begins hearing the voice of a woman [[Narration|narrating]] his life. When Harold's wristwatch stops working and he resets it using the time from a bystander, the voice narrates that this action will eventually result in Harold's death. Harold consults a [[psychiatrist]] who suggests he see a literary expert if he believes there is a narrator. Harold visits Jules Hilbert, a literature professor, who initially dismisses Harold. However, he recognizes [[Omniscience|omniscient]] narrative devices in what Harold claims the voice said, and is intrigued. He tries to help Harold identify the author and determine if his story is a [[comedy]] or [[tragedy]].\n\nAs Harold audits Ana he develops an attraction to her, but when he obliviously rejects a gift of cookies because it could be considered a bribe, he takes it as a sign he is in a tragedy. Jules tells Harold to spend the day at home doing nothing, and Harold's living room is destroyed by a demolition crew that went to the wrong building. Jules takes such an improbable occurrence as proof that Harold is no longer in control of his own life, and advises he enjoy the time he has left, accepting whatever [[destiny]] the narrator has for him. Harold takes time off work, takes guitar lessons, moves in with his co-worker Dave, and starts dating Ana. Since she loves him, Harold re-evaluates his story as a comedy. While meeting with Jules, Harold sees a television interview with author Karen Eiffel and recognizes her voice as his narrator's. Jules, an admirer of Karen's work, says that all of her books are tragedies: the protagonist always dies. Karen has been struggling with [[writer's block]] on her next book because she cannot figure out how to kill Harold Crick, but has had a breakthrough and begun writing again.\n\nHarold telephones Karen and stuns her when he accurately recounts her book to her. The two meet in person and she explains she has outlined the conclusion but not yet typed it in full. Her assistant, Penny, recommends Harold read the outline, but he cannot bring himself to do so, and gives it to Jules. Jules deems it Karen's masterpiece to which Harold's death is integral, and he consoles Harold that death is inevitable, but this death will hold a deeper meaning. Harold reads the outline and returns it to Karen, and tells her the death she has written for him is beautiful and he accepts it. Harold takes care of some errands and spends his last night with Ana. The next morning Harold goes about his routine again as Karen writes and narrates. She reveals that when Harold reset his wristwatch, the bystander's time was three minutes fast, so Harold has reached the bus stop early. A boy riding a bicycle falls in front of the bus; Harold runs into the street to save him, but is hit himself. However, Karen, traumatized by the idea that she unwittingly narrated real people to their deaths, cannot bring herself to finish the sentence declaring him dead.\n\nHarold wakes up in a hospital, and learns that shrapnel from his wristwatch \u2013 which was destroyed in the collision \u2013 blocked his [[ulnar artery]] and saved him from bleeding to death. Karen meets Jules and offers him a revised ending. Jules finds the new ending weakens the book, and Karen replies the book was about a man who did not know he was going to die, but if Harold knew and accepted his fate, he is the kind of person who deserves to live. Karen's narration closes the film over a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] of Harold's newly invigorated life, ending on the ruined wristwatch that saved his life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Harold Crick, an IRS agent who starts hearing Eiffel's voice narrating his life.\n* [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] as Ana Pascal, a baker who is being audited by Crick and begins to fall in love with him.\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as Karen Eiffel, an author known for killing the protagonists in her novels, but has been suffering from [[writer's block]].\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Professor Jules Hilbert, a literature expert advising Crick.\n* [[Queen Latifah]] as Penny Escher, an assistant who helps authors finish their works.\n* [[Tony Hale]] as Dave, Crick's friend from his work.\n* [[Tom Hulce]] as Dr. Cayly\n* [[Linda Hunt]] as Dr. Mittag-Leffler, a psychologist whom Crick sees in hopes of solving his narration problem.\n* [[Kristin Chenoweth]] as Book Channel Host\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nIn 2001, writer [[Zach Helm]] was working with producer Clarence Helmus on a project they called \"The Disassociate\".<ref>Lindsey Doran, \"Words on a Page\" bonus featurette on DVD</ref> Helm came to Doran with a new idea involving a man who finds himself accompanied by a narrator that only he can hear. Helm next decided that the narrator should state that the man is going to die because, as Helm described, \"there's something very poetic about the understanding of one's place in the universe, but it's far more dramatic when such understanding occurs only days before that life ends.\" Helm and Doran began referring to the new project as \"The Narrator Project\" and developed the story through a process of Helm's bringing ideas and Doran's asking questions. One of Helm's main ideas involved engaging the movie's form as much as its content.<ref name=\"this original URL\">SONY Pictures Entertainment (2006). [https://web.archive.org/web/20081209133744/http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies/stranger-than-fiction/notes.pdf \"Stranger than Fiction: Production Notes\"], document archived at WebCite July 6, 2008 based on the version posted at [http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies/stranger-than-fiction/notes.pdf this original URL].</ref>\n\nHelm named each of the film's chief characters after a famous scientist or scientifically influential artist, examples including [[Francis Crick|Crick]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [[Gustave Eiffel|Eiffel]], [[M. C. Escher|Escher]], and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]. When the character of Dr. Hilbert tells Harold that he has devised a series of 23 questions in order to investigate the narrator, it is a playful reference to [[Hilbert's 23 problems]]. The film's title derives from a quote by Lord Byron: \"Tis strange\u2014but true; for truth is always strange, Stranger than fiction\".<ref>1823, Don Juan: Cantos XIII, XIII, and XIV, George Gordon Byron (Lord Byron), Canto 14, Stanza 101, Quote Page 165, Printed for John Hunt, London.</ref>\n\nAccording to Helm, one of the film's major themes is of interconnectivity. Helm stated \"Each of these characters ends up doing little things to save one another. There's an underlying theme that the things we take most for granted are often the ones that make life worth living and actually keep us alive.\"<ref name=\"this original URL\"/>\n\n===Photography===\nThe film was shot on location in Chicago, Illinois. Dave's apartment, in which Harold takes residence after his own building partially is demolished, is part of the [[River City (building)|River City Condominiums]].<ref name=\"imdb.com\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420223/locations IMDB: Filming locations for \u2013 Stranger Than Fiction (2006)]</ref> Hilbert's office was in a lecture hall at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

Reitzell is also the film's music supervisor. The soundtrack includes an original recording of \"[[(I'd Go The) Whole Wide World|Whole Wide World]]\", the song that Harold plays for Ana, by [[Wreckless Eric]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Greenblatt, Leah |title=The story behind '\"Whole Wide World'\" |url=https://ew.com/article/2006/12/01/story-behind-whole-wide-world/ |access-date=5 February 2021 |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=December 1, 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Stranger than Fiction'' was released in the United States on November 10, 2006.
