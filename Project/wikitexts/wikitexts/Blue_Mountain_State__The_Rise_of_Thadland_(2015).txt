Spiro]] and starring [[Darin Brooks]], [[Alan Ritchson]], and [[Chris Romano]]. It is based on the Spike (now [[Paramount Network]]) series ''[[Blue Mountain State]]''. Picking up where season 3 of the series left off, the plot follows Alex Moran, now in his senior year, who must throw an epic party for Thad, who has recently been drafted into the [[National Football League|NFL]], in an effort to get him to buy the Goat House from the new Dean of sports.\n\nFollowing the cancellation of the series in early 2012, rumors of a reboot of feature-length film circulated. As the show gained a cult following, members of the cast, including [[Ed Marinaro]] and [[Page Kennedy]], hinted at a possible project. On April 8, 2014, the film was officially announced, with the creators launching a [[Kickstarter]] to raise funds; filming took place in [[North Carolina]] in late-2014. The film was released on February 2, 2016 by [[Lionsgate]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nAlex Moran has begun his senior year at Blue Mountain State. Since the team is predicted to not do as well this season, he decides to dedicate his final year more to partying.\n\nMeanwhile, a new dean threatens to take over the Goat House, the party location for the school's football team, Alex reaches out to Thad Castle, who has recently been drafted into the NFL, to buy the house. Thad agrees he will, but only if Alex throws a party in his honor and it meets his wild expectations. The party, full of drugs and amusement rides, gets out of hand, but Thad is impressed nevertheless.\n\nThe auction begins for the house, and Thad bids five million dollars on it (having outbid himself from three million). Alex celebrates having \"his\" house back, and Thad confronts him on only thinking of himself when agreeing to create Thadland. Thad angrily banishes Alex from the Goat House.\n\nAlex, in a dream, sees a potential future where Sammy is dead, Thad, now a middle-aged wash-up, is living in the Goat House, having never left, and Alex is now his house boy. Horrified, Alex wakes up in the middle of a deserted field. He walks to a nearby road, where he flags down a car driven by his old teammate, Craig Shilo. The two go to Thadland together, which is still running as a shell of its former self, with derelict amusement attractions and multiple deaths as a result of partying too much. Alex finds a drugged out Sammy, who has eaten Billy as a form of vengeance.\n\nAt a press conference about Thadland and Coach Marty Daniels' poor personal behavior, Daniels angrily tells the reporters and Dean Oliviares off, admitting to everything he's done and denying any regret for it.\n\nIn the basement of the Goat House, Alex confronts Harmon about a balloon-based drugs and what is inside of them. Harmon reveals that the drugs are a fermented gas derived from the house's septic tank. A disgusted Alex uses his authority as captain to coerce Harmon to shut the tanks down, to which he complies. Upstairs, Alex finds Thad and Mary Jo, both of whom are high due to the drug. Alex confronts him about his supposed wealth and asks why he can waste his time at a party at a college campus rather than attending practice with his professional team. Thad tearfully reveals that his contract was voided due to his bad behavior upon receiving his money, and that all of his wealth was fake. Alex, enraged, asks why he did that, and Thad produces a handgun, declaring that if he couldn't have his wealth, he wanted to die because he was out of money and had no friends. Alex refuses to help Thad kill himself, but instead has another plan.\n\nIn the basement, Dick Dawg, Thad's cousin, begins to rig the septic and gas tanks to explode, but is confronted by a drugged Sammy; the two fight, with Dick Dawg easily overpowering Sammy, who is knocked unconscious by falling debris. The house begins to crumble, prompting everyone inside to evacuate. Upstairs, Alex and Thad embrace, with Thad asking him to remember his story. Alex leaves with Mary Jo, which Dick Dawg carries the unconscious Sammy out of harm's way. The Goat House explodes.\n\nMary Jo sympathetically consoles Alex about the house he fought so hard for, to which he responds that it's \"just a house.\" The Dean celebrates his so-called victory over Alex but begins to hyperventilate from the excitement. Before Alex can confront him, Harmon, in the guise of providing oxygen, gives Oliviares a puff of his drug. The dean begins to hallucinate and promptly begins humping Holly, likely costing him his reputation and job. In a line-up, Alex, Mary Jo, Larry, Donnie, Harmon, Shilo, and Radon all toast to Thad's memory.\n\nOne month later, Thad is relaxing on a beach (with a mojito).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Darin Brooks]] as Alex Moran\n* [[Alan Ritchson]] as Thad Castle\n* [[Chris Romano]] as Sammy Cacciatore\n* [[Ed Marinaro]] as Coach Marty Daniels\n* [[Frankie Shaw]] as Mary Jo Cacciatore\n* [[Rob Ramsay]] as Donnie Schrab\n* [[James Cade]] as Harmon Tedesco\n* [[Omari Newton]] as Larry Summers\n* [[Jimmy Tatro]] as Dick Dawg\n* [[Ed Amatrudo]] as Dean Olivares\n* [[Sam Jones III]] as Craig Shilo\n* [[Page Kennedy]] as Radon Randell\n* Lindsey Sporrer as Holly\n* [[Dhani Jones]] as himself\n*Hudson Shank as Young Thad<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hudson Shank|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7331825/|website=IMDb|language=en|access-date=2020-05-07}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nIn March 2013, [[Ed Marinaro]] stated in an interview with Class Act Sports that he was working on a Blue Mountain State film.

On April 15, the production launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign, much like the hugely successful 2013 campaign by ''[[Veronica Mars]]'' to get the cancelled show made into a [[Veronica Mars (film)|feature film]]. The project's goal was to raise $1.5 million by May 15 in order to fund the film. There were rewards for donating to campaign, such as personalized tweets from the cast (for donating $10), shot and pint glasses with the BMS logo ($20), and a speaking role in the film (for a $10,000 donation).\n\nOn May 11, 2014, the Kickstarter goal of $1.5 million was reached. On May 15, 2014 the Kickstarter campaign ended, with the final funds raised being $1,911,827 from 23,999 backers.<ref name=kick1>{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/773106364/blue-mountain-state-the-movie|title=Blue Mountain State: The Movie|work=[[Kickstarter]]|accessdate=May 15, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2014, it was announced [[Jay Chandrasekhar]] would be the director of the film.<ref name=\"Jay Chandrasekhar\">{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dYp-m_god8|title=Jay Chandrasekhar is directing BMS The Movie!|date=May 12, 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> However, on September 28, 2014, [[Lev L.
