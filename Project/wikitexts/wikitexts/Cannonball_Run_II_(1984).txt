Like the original ''[[The Cannonball Run|Cannonball Run]]'', it is set around an illegal cross-country race.\n\nThis was the last of the \"formula\" comedies for Reynolds. It also marked the final feature film appearances of [[Dean Martin]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]. Their appearances, coupled with those of [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]], marked the final on-screen appearance of the [[Rat Pack]] team. The film also marked the final film appearance of [[Jim Nabors]] before his death in November 2017. The film also featured [[Jackie Chan]] in his third Hollywood role.\n\n==Plot==\nHaving lost the first Cannonball Run race, Sheik Abdul ben Falafel is ordered by his father, the King, to go back to America and win another Cannonball Run in order to \"emblazon the Falafel name as the fastest in the world\". When Sheik Abdul points out that there is no Cannonball Run that year, his father simply tells him to \"buy one\".\n\nTo make sure his \"Royal Ulcer\" does not prevent him from winning, the Sheik hires Doctor Nikolas Van Helsing, who teamed with J.J. McClure and Victor Prinzi in the first race as his in-car physician. Most of the participants from the first race are lured back, including J.J. and Victor, who have taken jobs working with a flying stunt crew.\n\nIn a subplot, Blake and Fenderbaum are in financial trouble with Don Don Canneloni, who in turn is in similar financial trouble with mob enforcer Hymie Kaplan. After the Sheik manages to bail out Blake and Fenderbaum by handing one of Don Don's thugs a stack of cash, Don Don hatches a plot to kidnap the Sheik in an attempt to extort money from him.\n\nThe race begins with J.J. and Victor dressed as a US Army general and his driver, a private. They catch the attention of Betty and Veronica, who are dressed as nuns for a musical, but remain in character and hitch a ride with J.J. and Victor when they think the guys could become overnight millionaires. They do not lose their habits until later.\n\nOther racers include Mitsubishi engineer [[Jackie Chan]], teamed with a giant behind the wheel in a car\u2014a [[Mitsubishi Starion]]\u2014able to go under water. In a red Lamborghini (white at first) with \"two great-looking chicks in it\" (as the cops chasing them continually say) is the duo of Jill Rivers and Marcie Thatcher. Another team in a [[Cadillac Fleetwood]] is accompanied by an orangutan, who appears to be the vehicle's [[chauffeur]]. They are pulled over at one point by two California Highway Patrol officers.\n\nJ.J. and Victor stop along the way to help a stranded soldier, Homer Lyle. They also get much better acquainted with their passengers, Betty and Veronica, who change into something a little more comfortable.\n\nDon Don's enforcers continue to blunder along the way, with disastrous results.\n\nAfter Don Don's gang capture the Sheik, the racers band together to invade Don Don's \"Pinto Ranch\". J.J., Victor, and Fenderbaum [[Infiltration tactics|infiltrate]] it in [[drag (clothing)|drag]], dressed as [[belly dancers]]. Others barrel in by car and rescue the Sheik, who is reluctant to leave, since he has his pick of women there. The three \"dancers\" and Blake go to their Leader to seek help, only to have him jump into the race himself.\n\nIn the end, the Sheik bankrolls Don Don's Ranch and then declares that he is upping the stakes to $2 million for the winner. All jump into their automobiles and make a dash for the finish line, avoiding traffic patrollers on the way.\n\nThe Sheik, as it turns out, loses yet again, this time blaming the doctor who rode with him for injecting him with an unknown substance. He convinces his father that he will win the return-trip race, having hired the winner of this one. It turns out to be the [[orangutan]] with a penchant for destructive behavior and giving elderly ladies the middle finger.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as J.J.

Needham said that Smith was worried about his improvisational style: \"I think she was scared to death to be up there against Burt and Dom. I don't want someone on the set that's gonna be that scared. So we went somewhere else\".<ref name=\"hal\"/> She was replaced by Shirley Maclaine.<ref name=\"hal\"/>\n\nFrank Sinatra agreed to do a cameo at the suggestion of Davis and Martin. Needham wrote three versions of the script for him: one where he would work a week, two days, or a day. He picked the latter. He was paid $30,000 which he donated to charity.<ref name=\"hal\"/> It was the first film he had made in three years and the first time he had reunited with Rat Pack members professionally or personally in three years.

Siskel named it his least-favorite film that he had seen during his time doing ''At the Movies'' with Ebert. Both critics expressed bewilderment by Burt Reynolds' career choices, declaring that he was wasting his considerable talent and noting that Reynolds' huge fan base did not like the film (nor the recent ''[[Stroker Ace]]'') and would stop going to see his movies if he continued to make such terrible films.\n\nThe film received eight [[Golden Raspberry Award]] nominations at the [[1984 Golden Raspberry Awards]], including Worst Picture, Worst Actor and Worst Actress.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Speed Zone]]'', also known as ''Cannonball Fever'' and ''Cannonball Run III''\n* [[Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0087032}}\n* {{Allmovie title}}\n* {{tcmdb title|18321}}\n* {{rotten tomatoes|cannonball_run_2}}\n* [http://film.virtual-history.com/film.php?filmid=479 Movie stills]\n\n{{Hal Needham}}\n{{portal bar|Film|United States|Hong Kong|Cars|1980s}}\n\n[[Category:1984 films]]\n[[Category:1980s comedy road movies]]\n[[Category:American comedy road movies]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American auto racing films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Hal Needham]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Tucson, Arizona]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Nevada]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Golden Harvest films]]\n[[Category:1984 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
