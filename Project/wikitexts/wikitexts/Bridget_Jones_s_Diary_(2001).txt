A co-production of the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]] and [[France]], it is based on Fielding's [[Bridget Jones's Diary (novel)|1996 novel of the same name]], which is a reinterpretation of [[Jane Austen]]'s 1813 novel ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''. The [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] stars [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as [[Bridget Jones]], a 32-year-old British single woman, who writes a diary which focuses on the things she wishes to happen in her life. However, her life changes when two men vie for her affection, portrayed by [[Colin Firth]] and [[Hugh Grant]]. [[Jim Broadbent]] and [[Gemma Jones]] appear in supporting roles. Production began in August 2000 and ended in November 2000, and took place largely on location in London and the [[home counties]].\n\n''Bridget Jones's Diary'' premiered on 4 April 2001 in the United Kingdom and was released to theatres on 13 April 2001 simultaneously in the United Kingdom and in the United States. It grossed over $280 million worldwide and received positive reviews, with critics highlighting Zellweger's titular performance, which garnered her a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. Over the years, it has been hailed as part of the [[Culture of the United Kingdom|English pop culture]], with Bridget Jones being cited as a [[List of cultural icons of England#Fictional characters|British cultural icon]].\n\nThe success of the film spawned a ''[[Bridget Jones (film series)|Bridget Jones]]'' franchise with two equally successful sequels being released, ''[[Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason]]'' (2004) and ''[[Bridget Jones's Baby]]'' (2016).\n\n==Plot==\nBridget Jones is 32, single, engagingly imperfect, and worried about her weight. She works as a publicity assistant at a publishing company in London where her main focus is fantasizing about her boss, Daniel Cleaver.\n\nAt her parents' New Year party, Bridget is introduced to Mark Darcy, a childhood acquaintance and handsome barrister, son of her parents' friends. Mark calls Bridget foolish and vulgar, and she thinks he is arrogant and rude. Overhearing Mark grumble to his mother about her attempt to set him up with \"a verbally incontinent spinster who smokes like a chimney, drinks like a fish, and dresses like her mother\", Bridget forms the New Year's resolution to turn her life around. She begins keeping a diary to chronicle her attempts to stop smoking, stop drinking, lose weight, and find her Mr. Right.\n\nBridget and Daniel begin to flirt heavily at work, ahead of an important book launch, at which Bridget bumps into Mark and his glamorous and haughty colleague Natasha. Bridget leaves with Daniel and they have dinner, despite Daniel's notorious reputation as a womaniser. Daniel tells Bridget that he and Mark were formerly friends but as Mark slept with his fianc\u00e9e, they now hate each other. Bridget and Daniel start dating.\n\nBridget is invited to a family party, originally a \"Tarts & Vicars\" costume party, so she ties it into a mini-break weekend with Daniel. They spend the day before the party at a country inn where Mark and Natasha are also staying. The morning of the party, Daniel says he must return to London for work and leaves Bridget dressed as a Playboy bunny to endure the party alone. When she returns to London and drops in on Daniel, she discovers his American colleague, Lara naked in his flat. Bridget cuts ties with him and immediately searches for a new career. She lands a new job in television, and when Daniel pleads with her to stay, she declares that she would \"rather have a job wiping Saddam Hussein's arse\".\n\nBridget attends a friend's long-standing dinner party, where she is the only unaccompanied person. Once again she crosses paths with Mark and Natasha. He privately confesses to Bridget that, despite her faults, he likes her \"just as you are\". Sometime later, he allows Bridget an exclusive TV interview in a landmark legal case which boosts her career and allows her to see him differently.\n\nBridget begins to develop feelings for Mark, and when she misguidedly and somewhat disastrously, attempts to cook her own birthday dinner party, he comes to her rescue. After a happy dinner celebration with Bridget's friends and Mark, a drunken Daniel arrives and temporarily monopolises Bridget's attention. Mark leaves, but returns to challenge Daniel and they fight in the street, eventually smashing through a window of a Greek restaurant. The fight eventually ends, with Bridget chiding Mark and he leaving, but after a self-serving appeal from Daniel, she rejects him as well.\n\nBridget's mother, Pamela, has left Bridget's father Colin and begun an affair with perma-tanned shopping channel presenter Julian. When the affair ends, she returns to the Jones's family home and off-handedly reveals that Mark and Daniel's falling-out resulted from Daniel (then Mark's best friend at [[Cambridge University]]) sleeping with Mark's wife which Mark walked in on, not the other way around.\n\nAt the Darcys' ruby wedding anniversary party the same day, Bridget confesses her feelings for Mark, only to learn that he and Natasha have accepted jobs in New York and are on the verge of an engagement, according to Mark's father. Bridget interrupts the toast with an emotionally moving speech that peters out as she realises the hopelessness of her position. Although her words have an effect on Mark, he still flies to New York. Bridget's friends rally to repair her broken heart with a surprise trip to Paris, but as they are about to leave, Mark appears at Bridget's flat.\n\nJust as they are about to kiss for the first time, Bridget flies to her bedroom to change into sexier underwear. Mark peeks at her diary, reads her earlier unflattering opinions of him, and leaves. Bridget, realizing what he has read and fearing she has lost him again, runs outside after him in the snow in her tigerskin-print underwear and a thin cardigan, but doesn't find him. Disheartened, she is about to return home when he reappears, she apologises and he presents her with a new diary, \"to make a fresh start\". They kiss in the snow-covered street.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as [[Bridget Jones]]\n* [[Colin Firth]] as Mark Darcy\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as Daniel Cleaver\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Mr. Colin Jones\n* [[Gemma Jones]] as Mrs. Pamela Jones\n* [[Celia Imrie]] as Una Alconbury\n* [[James Faulkner (actor)|James Faulkner]] as 'Uncle' Geoffrey\n* [[Shirley Henderson]] as Jude\n* [[James Callis]] as Tom\n* [[Sally Phillips]] as Sharon \"Shazzer\"\n* [[Lisa Barbuscia]] as Lara\n* [[Donald Douglas (Scottish actor)|Donald Douglas]] as Admiral Darcy\n* [[Charmian May]] as Mrs. Darcy\n* [[Paul Brooke]] as Mr. Fitzherbert\n* [[Embeth Davidtz]] as Natasha Glenville\n* [[Patrick Barlow]] as Julian\n* [[Felicity Montagu]] as Perpetua\n* [[Neil Pearson]] as Richard Finch \n* [[Dolly Wells]] as Woney\n}}\n[[Salman Rushdie]], [[Julian Barnes]], [[Jeffrey Archer]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090630072301/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/240532/Bridget-Jones-s-Diary/cast Bridget Jones's Diary (2001) Acting Credits], www.movies.nytimes.com.

The single became Halliwell's fourth consecutive number-one hit single in [[UK Singles Chart]] and it became her most successful solo single to date. \"Feels Like Sex\", another song from the album was originally slated as the lead single, but after \"[[It's Raining Men]]\" was offered to Halliwell, the song was released as the first single, and was added to ''[[Scream If You Wanna Go Faster|Scream if You Wanna Go Faster]]''.\n\nHalliwell's version received positive reviews by music critics, experienced international success and hit the top ten in over two dozen countries around the world, going to number one in several of them, although it did not fare as well on the American charts.
