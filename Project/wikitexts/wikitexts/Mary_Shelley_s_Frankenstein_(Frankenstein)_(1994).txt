Considered the most faithful [[film adaptation]] of [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel, ''[[Frankenstein|Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus]]'', despite several differences and additions in plot from the novel, the film follows a medical student named Victor Frankenstein who creates new life in the form of a monster composed of various corpses' body parts.<ref name=Sleep>{{cite news|title= Sleep Tight, a Monstrous Season Approaches: Movies: Those perennial masters of the dark, Frankenstein's monster and Count Dracula, return in a pair of new films.

The film received mixed reviews from critics, grossing $112 million worldwide on a budget of $45 million, deeming it less successful than the previous [[Francis Ford Coppola]]-produced horror adaptation, ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (1992).\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1794, Captain Walton leads a troubled expedition to reach the [[North Pole]]. While their ship is trapped in the ice of the [[Arctic Sea]], the crew hears a frightening noise and witnesses a mysterious figure killing their sled dogs before vanishing. The crew rescues a man, [[Victor Frankenstein]], who had fallen in the Arctic waters. When Walton tells Victor of his determination to continue the expedition, Victor replies, \"Do you share my madness?\" He proceeds to tell Walton and the crew his life story, presented in [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]].\n\nVictor grows up in [[Geneva]] with his adopted sister, [[Elizabeth Lavenza]], the love of his life. Before he leaves for the [[University of Ingolstadt]], Victor's mother dies giving birth to his brother William. Devastated by her loss, Victor vows on his mother's grave that he will find a way to conquer death. Victor and his friend [[Henry Clerval]] study under [[Doctor Waldman|Shmael Augustus Waldman]], a professor whose notes contain information on how to create life; Waldman warns Victor not to use them, lest he create an \"abomination\".\n\nWhile performing vaccinations, Waldman is murdered by a patient, who is later hanged in the village square. Using the killer's body, a leg from a fellow student who died of [[cholera]], and Waldman's brain, Victor builds a [[Frankenstein's monster|creature]] based on the professor's notes. He is so obsessed with his work that he drives Elizabeth away when she comes to take him away from Ingolstadt, which is being [[quarantine]]d amid a [[cholera]] epidemic. Victor finally gives his creation life, but he is horrified by the creature's hideous appearance and tries to kill him. Frightened and confused, the creature steals Victor's coat and flees the laboratory, and is later driven away by the townspeople when he tries to steal food.\n\nThe creature finds shelter in a family's barn and stays there for months without their knowledge, gradually learning to read and speak by watching them. He attempts to earn their trust by anonymously bringing them food, and eventually converses with the elderly, blind patriarch after murdering an abusive debt collector. When the blind man's family returns, however, they are terrified of the creature and chase him away. The creature finds Victor's journal in his coat and learns of the circumstances of his creation. He burns down the farm and vows revenge on Victor for bringing him into a world that hates him.\n\nVictor returns to Geneva to marry Elizabeth, only to find that his younger brother William has been murdered. The Frankensteins' servant Justine is blamed for the crime and hanged, but Victor knows the creature is responsible. The creature abducts Victor and demands that he make a female companion for him, promising to leave his creator in peace in return. Victor begins gathering the tools he used to create life, but when the creature insists that he use Justine's body to make the companion, a disgusted Victor breaks his promise. The creature exacts his revenge on Victor's wedding night by breaking into Elizabeth's bridal suite and ripping her heart out.\n\nDesperate with grief, Victor races home to bring Elizabeth back to life. He stitches Elizabeth's head onto Justine's body and reanimates her as a disfigured, mindless shadow of her former self. The creature appears, demanding Elizabeth as his bride. Victor and the creature fight for Elizabeth's affections, but Elizabeth, horrified by her own reflection, commits suicide by setting herself on fire. Both Victor and the creature escape as the mansion burns down.\n\nThe story returns to the Arctic. Victor tells Walton that he has been pursuing his creation for months to kill him. Soon after relating his story, Victor dies of [[pneumonia]]. Walton discovers the creature weeping over Victor's body, having lost the only family he has ever known. The crew prepares a [[funeral pyre]], but the ceremony is interrupted when the ice around the ship cracks. Walton invites the creature to stay with the ship, but the creature insists on remaining with the pyre. He takes the torch and burns himself alive with Victor's body. Walton, having seen the consequences of Victor's obsession, orders the ship to return home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as [[Frankenstein's monster|The Creation]], a reanimated corpse who is rejected by all of humanity and swears revenge on the entire world as a result.\n** De Niro also portrays Professor Waldman's killer, whose body was used for the creature.\n* [[Kenneth Branagh]] as [[Victor Frankenstein]], a scientist obsessed with conquering death, an obsession that ultimately destroys his life.\n** [[Rory Jennings]] as young Victor Frankenstein.\n* [[Tom Hulce]] as Henry Clerval, Frankenstein's best friend and fellow medical student, and later, his trusted partner when he inherits his father's practice.\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as [[Elizabeth Lavenza|Elizabeth Lavenza Frankenstein]], Frankenstein's fianc\u00e9e and adoptive sister.

He took a poignant, thought-provoking tragedy and turned it into a heavy metal monster movie. The casting of Robert De Niro as the monster was beyond inexplicable.\" [[Frank Darabont]], who did a second draft, later called the film \"the best script I ever wrote and the worst movie I've ever seen\". He elaborated:\n<blockquote>There's a weird [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] effect when I watch the movie. It's kind of like the movie I wrote, but not at all like the movie I wrote. It has no patience for subtlety. It has no patience for quiet moments. It has no patience period. It's big and loud and blunt and rephrased by the director at every possible turn. Cumulatively, the effect was a totally different movie. I don't know why Branagh needed to make this big, loud film ... the material was subtle. Shelley's book was way out there in a lot of ways, but it's also very subtle. I don't know why it had to be this operatic attempt at filmmaking. Shelley's book is not operatic, it whispers at you a lot. The movie was a bad one. That was my [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]. That's where I really got my ass kicked most as a screenwriter ... [Branagh] really took the brunt of the blame for that film, which was appropriate. That movie was his vision entirely. If you love that movie you can throw all your roses at Ken Branagh's feet. If you hated it, throw your spears there too, because that was his movie.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bauer |first=Erik |url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/frank-darabont-on-the-shawhank-redemption/ |title=Frank Darabont on The Shawshank Redemption |website=Creativescreenwriting.com |date=April 22, 2016 |access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film had an approval rating of 42% based on 53 reviews.
