It is a sequel to the 2004 film ''[[National Treasure (film)|National Treasure]]'' and is the second film of the [[National Treasure (franchise)|''National Treasure'' franchise]]. The film stars [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Diane Kruger]], [[Justin Bartha]], [[Jon Voight]], [[Harvey Keitel]], [[Ed Harris]], [[Bruce Greenwood]], and [[Helen Mirren]]. The film premiered in [[New York City]] on December 13, 2007, and [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]] released it in North America on December 21, 2007. Critics surveyed by [[Rotten Tomatoes]] called it too similar to its predecessor. It grossed $459 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nFive days after the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], [[John Wilkes Booth]] and [[Michael O'Laughlen]], both members of the [[Knights of the Golden Circle|KGC]], approach Thomas Gates to decode a message copied into Booth's diary. Thomas recognizes the message as a [[Playfair cipher]], and translates it while Booth departs for [[Ford's Theatre]] to assassinate President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Thomas solves the puzzle, realizes Booth and O'Laughlen are trying to help [[the Confederacy]], and rips the cipher's pages from the diary to burn them. O'Laughlen shoots Thomas and flees with the one surviving page fragment, and a dying Thomas tells his son Charles the keyword for the cipher.\n\nMore than 140 years later, famed treasure-hunter Ben Gates tells Thomas' story at a Civilian Heroes conference. [[Black market]] dealer Mitch Wilkinson produces the page fragment, with Thomas Gates' name next to those of [[Mary Surratt]] and Dr. [[Samuel Mudd]]. The public believes Thomas helped kill Lincoln, and Ben and his father Patrick set out to disprove it. Using [[spectral imaging]], Ben discovers traces of the cipher on the diary page; when solved using the keyword, it points to the [[Replicas of the Statue of Liberty|smaller Statue of Liberty]] in Paris. Traveling there, Ben and his friend Riley Poole discover an engraving referencing the [[Resolute desk]]s. They head to London, reluctantly recruiting Ben's estranged girlfriend, Dr. Abigail Chase, along the way. Ben and Abigail sneak a peek at the Buckingham Palace desk, and obtain a [[Pre-Columbian]] carved plank from a secret drawer. Mitch, who had secretly [[Phone cloning|cloned]] Patrick's cell phone in order to track Ben's whereabouts, pursues the trio, and eventually obtains the wooden plank, but not after Ben manages to photograph it.\n\nBack in America, Patrick reluctantly asks his ex-wife, [[archaeology|archaeo]]-[[lexicology|lexicologist]] Dr. Emily Appleton, for help. She claims the carvings reference the \"center of the earth\", but points out that some of the glyphs are partial. Ben and Abigail convince Abigail's new boyfriend Connor, a [[White House Office of the Curator|White House Curator]], to let them see the Resolute Desk in the [[Oval Office]]. Ben discovers that the second plank has been replaced by a stamp of an altered [[Seal of the President of the United States|Presidential seal]], which Riley identifies as the symbol for a secret shared diary, written by [[President of the United States|Presidents]] and containing controversial topics such as [[Watergate]], [[Area 51]], and the [[JFK assassination]].\n\nBen crashes the President's birthday party at [[Mount Vernon]] to convince the President to explore a secret tunnel with him. There, Ben activates a secret sliding door, separates the President from his guards, and asks him about the book, while safely leading the President to freedom at the other end of the tunnel. The President sympathetically warns Ben that his actions, while innocently meant, will be interpreted as attempted kidnapping. He then reveals the book is hidden in a safe in the [[Library of Congress]]. Pursued by the FBI, Ben, Abigail, and Riley manage a brief look at the book. They find a photograph of the missing plank, and an entry by [[Calvin Coolidge]]. He found the plank in 1924, translated it, had it destroyed, and commissioned [[Gutzon Borglum]] to carve [[Mount Rushmore]], to hide evidence of a hidden treasure nearby.\n\nAfter consulting Emily about the glyphs, Ben, Riley, Abigail, and Patrick head to Mount Rushmore. They meet Mitch and Emily there, as Mitch kidnapped her after Ben left. Mitch already has acquired, memorized, and destroyed the final clue, so he can claim the treasure. He helps the group find the entrance of a cave full of booby traps. After briefly getting separated, the group finds a pit containing [[Quivira and C\u00edbola|C\u00edbola]], a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] city of gold. An ancient dam fails, and it becomes clear one of the group must sacrifice themselves in the quickly flooding cave to hold open the door for the others. Mitch does so, but begs Ben to give him posthumous credit for finding the treasure so he can be in the history books, too.\n\nBen and the rest return to the surface, where the President prevents Ben from being arrested by claiming Ben saved him from the tunnel's accidental closing. Ben ensures that Mitch receives joint credit for the discovery, rekindles his relationship with Abigail, and clears Thomas Gates' name by proving that Booth had consulted him about the treasure, not the assassination.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Benjamin Franklin \"Ben\" Gates, treasure hunter, historian and cryptologist\n* [[Diane Kruger]] as Dr. Abigail Chase, Director of Document Conservation at the National Archives, Ben's ex-girlfriend\n* [[Justin Bartha]] as Riley Poole, computer expert and author, Ben's best friend\n* [[Jon Voight]] as Patrick Henry Gates, Ben's father who is divorced from his wife Emily\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as Dr. Emily Appleton-Gates, professor of Native American Studies, Ben's mother who is divorced from her husband, Patrick\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Mitchell \"Mitch\" Wilkinson, a black market dealer \n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as FBI Special Agent Peter Sadusky\n* [[Armando Riesco]] as FBI Special Agent Hendricks\n* [[Alicia Coppola]] as FBI Special Agent Spellman\n* [[Albert Hall (actor)|Albert Hall]] as Dr. Nichols\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]] as President of the United States\n* [[Ty Burrell]] as Connor, White House curator, Abigail's new boyfriend.\n\n[[Randy Travis]] makes a cameo appearance, playing himself.
