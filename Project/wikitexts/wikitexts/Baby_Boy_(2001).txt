Johnson]] and [[Taraji P. Henson]].<ref name=IMDb>{{cite web|title=Baby Boy (2001)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0255819/|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|access-date=16 April 2012}}</ref> The film follows Joseph \"Jody\" Summers (Gibson), a 20-year-old bike mechanic who still lives with his own mother (Johnson), as he lives and learns in his everyday life in the [[Ghetto|hood]] of [[Los Angeles]].\n\nIt was the film debut of actress [[Taraji P. Henson]] and R&B singer [[Tyrese Gibson]]. Gibson and Henson later starred in the film ''[[Four Brothers (film)|Four Brothers]]'' (also directed by Singleton). The film, originally set to star rapper [[Tupac Shakur]], instead switched to Gibson after Shakur's [[Murder of Tupac Shakur|death in 1996]].\n\n==Plot==\nJoseph \"Jody\" Summers waits for his girlfriend Yvette at an [[abortion clinic]] after compelling her to go. They then have a heated argument about his lack of commitment and selfishness in their relationship; Yvette asks Jody if he will ever come live with her and their son JoJo, but Jody avoids the subject and comes and goes as he pleases.\n\nMeanwhile, Jody also continues having affairs with other women, including a young girl named Peanut, who Jody also has a child with. Jody also nearly has sex with Pandora, Yvette's colleague and co-worker, but manages to rebuff her advances. When she discovers his cheating, they get into another argument which eventually turns physical, culminating in Yvette kicking Jody out of her home.\n\nYvette's gangster ex-boyfriend Rodney is released from [[San Quentin State Prison]] and returns to the neighborhood to move in with Yvette. However, Rodney does not care for JoJo and wants to impregnate Yvette himself, but when Rodney attempts to rape Yvette in front of her son, he stops himself out of guilt. Despite their previous issues, Yvette begins to realize she is still in love with Jody.\n\nJody\u2019s mother Juanita finds [[marijuana]] in her garden and blames Jody. Jody then becomes angry at his mother and blames Melvin, her new boyfriend and an ex-convict. Melvin comes home and admits to Juanita that he planted it and apologizes for it, which Juanita forgives. An upset Jody argues with his mother, before getting into an argument with Melvin which ends with Melvin punching him and breaking a table.\n\nFrustrated, Jody leaves the house to see his friend Sweetpea. Soon after, Yvette kicks Rodney and his friends out of her apartment. Eventually, Yvette and Jody reconcile at Sweetpea's house, and Yvette tells Jody about how Rodney tried to rape her in front of JoJo. Rodney then steals Yvette\u2019s money and keys from her wallet and drives off in her car to go and find Jody. Rodney tries to kill Jody in a drive-by shooting, but is unsuccessful.\n\nLater that night, Jody and Sweetpea confront Rodney, and as he attempts to escape, Jody shoots him in the legs. Sweetpea urges Jody to kill Rodney, but he refuses, at which point Sweetpea shoots and kills Rodney himself. Horrified by Rodney's death, Jody prepares to commit [[suicide]] by shooting himself in the head, but is stopped by Melvin who then takes the gun. After reflecting on the death of Rodney and how he put Yvette and JoJo in danger due to his absence, Jody finally decides to move in with Yvette.\n\nJody then comes to accept that Juanita's relationship with Melvin is a stable one, and that he has a family of his own that he needs to protect and take care of. Afterward, Jody and Yvette get married and look forward to the birth of their unborn child.  Meanwhile, Sweetpea decides to get baptized and put his old life as a criminal behind him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tyrese Gibson]] as Joseph \"Jody\" Summers \n* [[Omar Gooding]] as Sweetpea \"Pea\", Jody's friend\n* [[Taraji P.

It is also a criticism of the society that pushes them into that niche. There has never been a movie with this angle on the African-American experience\" and \"[it] doesn't fall back on easy liberal finger-pointing. There are no white people in this movie, no simplistic blaming of others; the adults in Jody's life blame him for his own troubles, and they should.\"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Baby Boy movie review & film summary (2001) {{!}} Roger Ebert|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/baby-boy-2001|url-status=live|access-date=2021-10-17|website=rogerebert.com|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Kenneth Turan]], film critic for the ''Los Angeles Times'', praised the film for being \"...Compelling.... heartfelt and personal...\" Jonathan Rosenbaum of ''Chicago Reader'' also liked the film, stating \"Like John Singleton's other features, this is far from flawless....
