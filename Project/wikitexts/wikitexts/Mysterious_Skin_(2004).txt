The film tells the story of two pre-adolescent boys who both experienced sexual abuse as children, and how it affects their lives in different ways into their young adulthood. One boy becomes a reckless, sexually adventurous prostitute (played by [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]), while the other ([[Brady Corbet]]) retreats into a reclusive fantasy of [[alien abduction]].\n\n''Mysterious Skin'' premiered at the [[61st Venice International Film Festival]] in September 2004, although it was not more widely distributed until May 2005 without a rating. It grossed $2.1 million at the box office and received critical acclaim. Psychologists have praised ''Mysterious Skin'' for its accurate depiction of the long-term effects of [[child sex abuse]].\n\n==Plot==\nTwo eight-year-old [[Little League]] teammates, Neil McCormick and Brian Lackey, both experience life-altering events during the summer of 1981 in [[Hutchinson, Kansas|Hutchinson]], [[Kansas]]. Neil, the son of an irresponsible single mother and already discovering his own homosexuality, is [[Child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] by the Little League coach, who leaves town after that summer. Brian, whose parents are often neglectful or busy working, only remembers that it started to rain during a game. The next thing he remembers is being in the crawl space of his house with a bloody nose, having no memory of the intervening five hours.\n\nNeil views the coach's abuse as love, and develops an attraction to older men. He begins working as a hustler at the age of 15, and continues doing so three years later when he moves to New York City, where his best friend, Wendy Peterson, now lives. In New York, Neil has an emotional encounter with a client, Zeke, who is dying from AIDS and (instead of sex) only wants to feel another person's touch. Afterward, Neil begins withdrawing from sex work and takes a job at a sandwich shop with assistance and encouragement from Wendy.\n\nBrian suffers from chronic nosebleeds, blackouts, and bedwetting for years after coming to in the crawl space. He also has [[recurring dream]]s about being touched by a strange, bluish hand, which eventually lead Brian to suspect he may have been [[Abduction phenomenon|abducted by aliens]]. Another boy wearing the same Little League uniform begins to appear in these dreams later on. At 18, Brian meets a woman named Avalyn Friesen, who also believes she was abducted by aliens. They start to form a friendship, but when she makes sexual advances toward him, he panics and refuses to speak to her again.\n\nBrian sees a photo of his Little League team as he tries to untangle his confused memories, recognizing a young Neil as the other boy from his dreams. Meanwhile, after a client brutally rapes and beats him, Neil returns to Hutchinson to spend Christmas with his mother. There, Neil and Brian meet for the first time in over a decade. After breaking into the house that was previously rented by the Little League coach, Neil tells Brian what happened that night: the coach offered to drive Brian home with Neil after a baseball game was rained out, as Brian did not have a ride. Instead, they all went to the coach's house, where the coach performed sex acts on the boys and made them perform sex acts on each other. At one point, Brian collapsed face-first onto the floor, giving him a bloody nose, while a porch light caused the atmosphere to have an eerie blue color. Having finally learned the truth, Brian breaks down crying and is comforted by Neil as Christmas carolers sing \u201c[[Silent Night]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as Neil McCormick\n** [[Chase Ellison]] as young Neil McCormick\n* [[Brady Corbet]] as Brian Lackey \n** George Webster as young Brian Lackey  \n* [[Michelle Trachtenberg]] as Wendy \n** Riley McGuire as young Wendy\n* [[Jeff Licon]] as Eric Preston\n* [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]] as Avalyn Friesen\n* [[Elisabeth Shue]] as Ellen McCormick\n* [[Bill Sage]] as Coach\n* [[Chris Mulkey]] and Lisa Long as Mr. and Mrs. Lackey\n* [[Richard Riehle]] as Charlie\n* [[Kelly Kruger]] as Deborah\n** Rachael Nastassja Kraft as young Deborah\n* [[Billy Drago]] as Zeke\n\n==Production==\nBoth [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] and [[Michelle Trachtenberg]], by the time the film went into production, were looking for [[independent film]]s where making money was not the main goal.<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite news| url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/06/03/interview-joseph-gordon-levitt-brady-corbet-and-michelle-trachtenberg| title= Interview: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brady Corbet and Michelle Trachtenberg.| publisher=IGN.com |first=Jeff |last=Otto |date=2005-06-03| access-date=2013-01-29}}</ref> Trachtenberg was filming ''[[EuroTrip]]'' (2004) in Prague when she first received the script, and quickly decided to join production.<ref name=\"ign\" /> Gordon-Levitt was especially praiseful of Araki for allowing him to join production, and commented in a 2005 interview: \"It is a really different role for me, and I'll always be really grateful to Gregg for believing that I could do a role like this.

Although their parents were given the entire shooting script to review, the boys were given separate scripts which included only the activities they would be performing, and their roles and the characters' relationships were explained to them in innocent terms. All of the sexual abuse involving children is implied rather than being directly depicted, and the scenes in which this seduction and abuse takes place were filmed with each actor performing alone and addressing the camera rather than the other actor, then edited together, so the children did not see or hear the performance by the adult actor playing the abuser.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Interview |url=http://www.ratherronge.co.za/html/sub_content.aspx?reviewid=198 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204101019/http://www.ratherronge.co.za/html/sub_content.aspx?reviewid=198 |archive-date=December 4, 2008 |website=ratherronge.co.za}}</ref><ref>Director and actors' commentary track on DVD release</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Mysterious Skin'' received an 86% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 109 reviews with an average rating of 7.40/10.
