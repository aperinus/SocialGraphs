The plot centers on a [[Service of process|process server]] and his [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] dealer as they are forced to flee from hitmen and a corrupt police officer after witnessing them commit a murder. Producer [[Judd Apatow]], who previously worked with Rogen and Goldberg on ''[[Knocked Up]]'' and ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'', assisted in developing the story.\n\n[[Columbia Pictures]] released the film on August 6, 2008, and it grossed $102 million worldwide on a $26 million budget. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and has since developed a [[cult following]]. Franco was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award]] for his performance.\n\n==Plot==\nDale Denton, a [[Service of process|process server]] and marijuana enthusiast, visits his drug dealer, Saul. Dale and Saul smoke the rare \"Pineapple Express\" strain together before Dale leaves to resume working. He arrives at the home of Ted Jones and witnesses Ted and police officer Carol Brazier shoot and kill an Asian man. While fleeing, Dale throws his [[Roach (smoking)|roach]] containing Pineapple Express, which Ted identifies and he sends his henchmen Budlofsky and Matheson to Red, a drug dealer who tells them about Saul.\n\nBack at Saul's apartment, Dale learns Ted is a local drug lord and could trace the roach as only Red and Saul have the Pineapple Express strain. Dale and Saul decide they must flee the city. They attempt to hide in the woods where Dale's car battery dies. Dale and Saul visit Red, who after a fight, reveals that Ted knows who they are and intends to kill them. Budlofsky and Matheson torture Red for information and both shoot him in the abdomen. Believing his high-schooler girlfriend Angie to be in danger, he and Saul travel to her home where they are removed at gunpoint by her father. Budlofsky and Matheson arrive at the house but Dale and Saul depart before they can be captured and Angie's family goes to a hotel.\n\nDale and Saul then sell Pineapple Express to raise bus fare but Dale is arrested by police officer Bobbra. Dale tells Bobbra that he witnessed Brazier and Ted murder a man. Bobbra has long been suspicious of Brazier's corruption and says she will investigate; Saul, thinking he is rescuing Dale, hijacks the police car. Brazier hears on police radio of Dale's arrest and pursues Dale and Saul in a high-speed chase but they escape. After Dale and Saul argue and split up, Saul is kidnapped and is held in Ted's lair. Dale breaks up with Angie over the phone after she talks about marriage. Dale then enlists an injured Red to help to rescue Saul but Red backs out at the last minute and Dale is captured. While Dale and Saul are waiting to be killed, they reconcile their friendship and plan an escape.\n\nTed's rivals, a [[Kkangpae|Korean drug gang]], attack the lair to avenge their fellow gangster's death. Dale and Saul free themselves but are caught by Matheson. A brawl and shootout ensues; Matheson kills Budlofsky for refusing to kill anyone. Red reappears and drives his car through the barn, killing Matheson and saving Saul but is shot by Brazier. A member of the Korean gang sets off a bomb killing Ted and setting fire to the barn. Red's car explodes and lands on Brazier, killing her. Dale carries Saul from the burning lair and Red, severely wounded, also escapes and reconciles with them. They talk about their adventure over breakfast at a diner before Saul's grandmother picks them up and takes them to the hospital.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Dale Denton, a lazy process server and recreational marijuana smoker.\n* [[James Franco]] as Saul Silver, a laid-back, friendly, airheaded drug dealer.
