While broadly categorized as a western, or an [[epic film|epic]], the film encompasses several literary/film genres, including [[comedy film|comedy]], [[drama film|drama]] and [[adventure film|adventure]]. The film follows the life of a white man who was raised by members of the [[Cheyenne]] nation during the 19th century. The film is largely concerned with contrasting the lives of [[Settler|American pioneers]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] throughout the progression of the boy's life.  It stars [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Chief Dan George]], [[Faye Dunaway]], [[Martin Balsam]], [[Jeff Corey]] and [[Richard Mulligan]].\n\n''Little Big Man'' is an early  [[revisionist Western]] in its sympathetic depiction of Native Americans and its exposure of the villainous practices of the  [[United States Cavalry]].  The revision uses elements of [[satire]] and [[tragedy]] to examine [[prejudice]] and [[injustice]]. ''Little Big Man'' is an [[New Hollywood|anti-establishment film]] of the period, indirectly protesting America's involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] by portraying the [[United States Armed Forces]] negatively.<ref name=HollywoodsIndian/>\n\nIn 2014, ''Little Big Man'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref name=\"loc.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-14-210/new-films-added-to-national-registry/2014-12-17/|title=Cinematic Treasures Named to National Film Registry|website=Library of Congress|access-date=June 6, 2019|archive-date=November 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201126213653/https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-14-210/new-films-added-to-national-registry/2014-12-17/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1970, 121-year-old Jack Crabb, the oldest man in the world, is residing in a hospice and recounts his life story to a curious historian. Among other things, Crabb claims to have been a captive of the [[Cheyenne]], a [[gunslinger]], an associate of [[Wild Bill Hickok]], a scout for General [[George Armstrong Custer]], and the sole white survivor of the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]].<ref name=HollywoodsIndian>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kvLJQsO3O0oC&q=%22Little+Big+Man%22+film&pg=PP2|title=Hollywood's Indian: The Portrayal of the Native American in Film|date=2011|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|pages=121\u2013136|last1=Rollins|first1=Peter|isbn=978-0813131658|access-date=November 30, 2020|archive-date=June 14, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210614160639/https://books.google.com/books?id=kvLJQsO3O0oC&q=%22Little+Big+Man%22+film&pg=PP2|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Childhood===\nJack begins his story in a flashback to 1859, when he was 10&nbsp;years old. He and his older sister Caroline survived the massacre of their pioneer parents by the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] and are discovered by Shadow, a [[Cheyenne]] brave, who takes the siblings to his village. Caroline escapes, but Jack remains and is reared by the good-hearted tribal leader, Old Lodge Skins.<ref name=HollywoodsIndian/>\n\nAs Jack gets older, he unwittingly makes an enemy of another boy, Younger Bear; however, Younger Bear eventually owes his life to Jack when he saves Younger Bear's life from a Pawnee brave. Jack is given the name \"Little Big Man\" because he is short but very brave.\n\nIn 1865, when Jack is 16, he is captured by U.S.&nbsp;Cavalry troopers during a skirmish and renounces his Cheyenne upbringing in order to save himself from being killed. After spending time in U.S. Army custody and going through interrogations and debriefing, Jack, being a minor, is put in the foster care of Reverend Silas Pendrake and his sexually frustrated wife, Louise, who tries to seduce Jack. When he witnesses Mrs.&nbsp;Pendrake having sex with the soda shop owner, Jack leaves the Pendrake household and renounces his foster parents and religion.\n\n===Gunslinger===\nIn 1866, Jack becomes the apprentice of the [[snake-oil]] salesman Meriweather. The two are [[tarred and feathered]] when their customers realize that Meriweather's products are fraudulent. One of the angry customers is Jack's now-grown sister, Caroline, with whom he reunites. She attempts to mold her brother into a gunslinger named \"the Soda Pop Kid\". Jack meets [[Wild Bill Hickok]] at a saloon, and Hickok takes a liking to the young man. When Hickok is forced to kill a man in self-defense, Jack loses his taste for gunslinging and Caroline deserts him.\n\nSome months later, Jack becomes a partner in a [[general store]] and marries a Swedish woman named Olga. Jack's business partner turns out to be a thieving scoundrel. The famous cavalry officer George Armstrong Custer pays a visit and suggests the couple restart their lives further west and assures them they have nothing to fear from Indians.\n\nJack and Olga set out, but their [[stagecoach]] is ambushed by Cheyenne warriors. Olga is abducted and Jack sets out in search of her. He is reunited with Old Lodge Skins and Younger Bear. Younger Bear has become a [[Contrary (social role)|Contrary]] \u2013 a warrior who does everything in reverse. Jack makes friends with the [[two-spirit|Heemaneh]] Little Horse, but continues on his search for Olga.\n\n===First round with Custer===\nA few months later, Jack eventually becomes a \"[[Arriero|muleskinner]]\" in Custer's [[7th Cavalry Regiment|7th Cavalry]], only because Custer incorrectly determines that was Jack's past job. He takes part in a battle against the Cheyenne, but when the troopers begin killing women and children, Jack turns on them.\n\nOn the outskirts of the massacre, Jack is attacked by Shadow, the Cheyenne warrior who saved him as a child but now does not recognize him. Shadow is killed by a cavalryman, and Jack discovers Shadow's daughter, Sunshine, giving birth while hiding from the onslaught. He returns with her to Old Lodge Skins's tribe. Sunshine becomes his wife and bears him a child. Jack again encounters Younger Bear, who is no longer a Contrary but is now the henpecked husband of the long-lost Olga. The traumatized Olga does not recognize Jack, who makes no attempt to make her remember him. Sunshine asks Jack to take in her three widowed sisters as wives, and to father children with them. He is reluctant at first, but finally agrees.\n\nA little later in November 1868, Custer and the 7th&nbsp;Cavalry make a surprise attack on the Cheyenne camp at the [[Battle of Washita River|Washita River]]. Jack saves the now-blind and elderly Old Lodge Skins, but Sunshine, their child, and her sisters are killed. Jack tries to infiltrate Custer's camp to exact revenge, but loses his nerve to kill Custer.\n\n===Mad hermit===\nDisheartened, Jack withdraws from life and becomes the town drunk living in [[Deadwood, South Dakota]] for the next several years. While in a drunken stupor, he is recognized by [[Wild Bill Hickok]], who gives him money to get cleaned up. Hickok is shot and killed while playing cards and, with his last breath, asks Jack to bring some money to a widow he was having an affair with. Jack visits the widow, now a prostitute who turns out to be Louise Pendrake. Jack gives her the money that Hickok intended for her to use to start a new life, but again rebuffs her sexual advances.\n\nJack soon becomes a [[Animal trapping|trapper]] and [[hermit]]. His mind becomes unhinged after coming across an empty trap with a severed animal limb. He prepares to commit suicide, but sees Custer and his troops marching nearby, and decides to return to his quest for revenge.\n\n===Second round with Custer===\nCuster hires Jack as a scout, reasoning that anything he says will be a lie, thus serving as a perfect reverse barometer. Jack tricks Custer into leading his troops into a trap at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Little Bighorn]] (1876) by truthfully telling Custer of the overwhelming force of Native Americans hidden within the valley.\n\nAs Custer's troops are slaughtered by the combined Sioux and Cheyenne group, Custer begins to rave insanely. Jack is wounded. The maddened Custer attempts to shoot Jack when he tells Custer to shut up, but is killed by Younger Bear, who then carries Jack away from the battlefield. Having thus discharged his life debt, Younger Bear tells Jack that the next time they meet, he can kill Jack without becoming an evil person.<ref name=HollywoodsIndian/>\n\n===Old Lodge Skins awaits death, as does Jack===\nBack at the Cheyenne camp, Jack accompanies Old Lodge Skins to a nearby hill, the Indian burial ground, where the old man, dressed in full chief's regalia, has declared \"It is a good day to die\", and decides to end his life with dignity. He offers his spirit to the [[Great Spirit]], and lies down at his spot at the Indian Burial Ground to wait for death.\n\nInstead, it begins to rain. Old Lodge Skins is revealed to still be alive, and says, \"Well, sometimes the magic works. Sometimes it doesn't.\" They return to his lodge to have dinner.<ref name=HollywoodsIndian/>\n\n===Epilogue===\n\nBack in the present day, Jack abruptly ends his narrative story and he dismisses the historian. The final shot shows the aged Jack sitting in his wheelchair and somberly thinking back about his life in a world which no longer exists.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Jack Crabb (a.k.a. Little Big Man)\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as Louise Pendrake (a.k.a. Lulu Kane)\n* [[Chief Dan George]] as Old Lodge Skins\n* [[Martin Balsam]] as Allardyce T. Meriweather\n* [[Richard Mulligan]] as Gen. [[George Armstrong Custer]]\n* [[Jesse Vint]] as Lieutenant \n* [[Jack Bannon]] as Captain\n* [[Jeff Corey]] as [[Wild Bill Hickok]]\n* [[Jack Mullaney]] as card player\n* Aim\u00e9e Eccles as Sunshine\n* Kelly Jean Peters as Olga Crabb\n* Carole Androsky as Caroline Crabb\n* Robert Little Star as Little Horse\n* Cal Bellini as Younger Bear\n* [[Thayer David]] as Reverend Silas Pendrake\n* Ruben Moreno as Shadow That Comes in Sight\n* Steve Shemayne as Burns Red in the Sun\n* [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]] as the Historian\n* [[James K Anderson|James Anderson]] as Sergeant (in his final film role)\n\n==Historical basis==\nThe historical [[Little Big Man]] was a Native American leader bearing no resemblance to the Jack Crabb character. Little Big Man is known for his involvement in the capture and possible assassination of [[Crazy Horse]] at [[Fort Robinson]] in 1877.\n\nThe movie's portrayal of the [[Battle of Washita River]] as a Custer-led massacre of women and children (which Penn compares to [[the Holocaust]]) is not entirely accurate as the camp was partially occupied by tribal warriors {{Citation needed|reason=The US Army and the indigenous descendants of the battle are at odds with its historical account|date=September 2020}}. The film, however, is consistent with historical records of other encounters between Indians and the U.S. Cavalry; the Cavalry's common tactic was to wait until the warriors had left the camp to hunt, or to lure the warriors away with assurances of good hunting, and then to attack the unprotected village. The two massacre scenes are historically reversed, the [[Sand Creek massacre]] occurring first in 1864, where Colorado militia (not including Custer) attacked a peaceful contingent of Native Americans, killing more than 150 women, children and elderly men. (The Sand Creek Massacre was depicted in another 1970 Western, ''[[Soldier Blue]]''.) The Custer-led raid on the Washita occurred in 1868.\n\nThe film also presents an inaccurate representation of the death of [[Wild Bill Hickok]].  Hickok was actually killed nearly two months after the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]] on August 2, 1876, while playing poker at [[Nuttal & Mann's Saloon]] in [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], [[South Dakota]].  Uncharacteristically, Hickok had his back turned to the door.  At 4:15&nbsp;p.m., Jack McCall walked in and shot Hickok in the back of the head.  Hickok was famously holding two pairs \u2014 aces of uncertain suits and black eights \u2014 when he was shot, a set of cards thereafter called the \"[[Dead Man's Hand]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/wild-bill-hickok-is-murdered |title=Wild Bill Hickok is murdered \u2014 History.com This Day in History \u2014 8/2/1876 |publisher=History.com |date=August 5, 1953 |access-date=September 21, 2013 |archive-date=September 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922232047/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/wild-bill-hickok-is-murdered |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe film's depiction of Lieutenant Colonel [[George Armstrong Custer]] as a lunatic at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]] was intended as satire, though many of his quirks and vanities were inspired by contemporary observations. Custer's fatal tactics at the Little Bighorn were far more complex than portrayed in the film, which portrays him as having a searing hatred of Indians and acting ruthlessly towards them in battle.\n\nThe character of Jack Crabb is partially based on [[Curly (scout)|Curley]], one of Custer's [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] scouts from the [[Crow tribe]]. Curley rode with Custer's 7th Cavalry into the valley of the Little Bighorn, but was relieved of duty before the final attack, retreating to a nearby bluff and witnessing much of the action. Many conflicting stories of the era embellished Curley's participation, stating in several cases that he disguised himself with a Cheyenne blanket to escape the immediate field of battle. He was interviewed many times, with some writers claiming him to be the only surviving witness from the U.S. side of [[Custer's Last Stand]]. Curley gave several variations of his participation in the battle, and the accuracy of his later recollections has been questioned.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/curley-is-buried-at-little-big-horn |title=Curley is buried at Little Big Horn \u2014 History.com This Day in History \u2014 5/23/1923 |publisher=History.com |access-date=September 21, 2013 |archive-date=September 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922230755/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/curley-is-buried-at-little-big-horn |url-status=live }}</ref>  [[Thomas Leforge]], however, who had himself recruited most of the Crow scouts for the event, [[Curly (scout)#Curly's story|maintained]] in Leforge's narrated biography, that the claims were false and that Curley neither took part, as a scout had been expected to take part, nor himself claimed to have been in the battle.\n\n==Production==\nTo obtain the hoarse voice of a 121-year-old man, Hoffman sat in his dressing room and screamed at the top of his lungs for an hour. The makeup for the ancient Crabb was created by [[Dick Smith (make-up artist)|Dick Smith]] from [[foam latex]] and included revolutionary false eyelids that could blink along with the actor's. Due to editing, and much to Smith's chagrin, no blinks were visible in the finished film. Of the makeup, Hoffman was quoted in [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] as saying, \"I defy you to put on that makeup and not feel old\".<ref>[[Life (magazine)|''Life'']], November 20, 1970, volume 69 number 21, interview with [[Richard Meryman]]</ref> The role of Chief Old Lodge Skins was initially offered to [[Marlon Brando]], [[Paul Scofield]], and [[Laurence Olivier]], all of whom turned it down. The Little Bighorn battle scenes were filmed on location at [[Crow Agency, Montana]] near the actual battle site.  Some of the town scenes were filmed in [[Nevada City, Montana]], a town that by 1970 consisted predominantly of historic 19th-century buildings brought from elsewhere in Montana.\nAll outdoor Indian scenes other than the Little Bighorn battle were filmed near [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], Canada.  Some interior and various footage was shot on Hollywood sets. All Indian extras were North American Indians, though Aim\u00e9e Eccles, who played Sunshine, is actually of Chinese descent,<ref>Wood, Robin, \"Arthur Penn,\" Praeger Film Library (1969), p. 120-123</ref> and Cal Bellini, who played Younger Bear, is actually a Malay originally from Singapore.<ref>Cal Bellini</ref>\n\nOld Lodge Skins dies at the end of the novel but not in the film. In an interview Arthur Penn explained the change: \"We thought long and hard about this and in the first draft of the script he does die, but this death would have introduced an element of sadness into the film and we didn't want this. The film would have become dramatic, even melodramatic, instead of being [[picaresque]]. I also wanted to show that not only were the Indians going to be destroyed, but they were also condemned to live. On the whole, audiences like their entertainment dramatically compact and homogenous, but I want the opposite. A film should remain free and open, not with everything defined and resolved.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Penn|first=Arthur|title=Arthur Penn: interviews|year=2008|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-60473-104-0|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Obdm2EPUNusC&q=little+big+man|access-date=November 30, 2020|archive-date=June 14, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210614160610/https://books.google.com/books?id=Obdm2EPUNusC&q=little+big+man|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Little Big Man'' received widespread acclaim from film critics.
