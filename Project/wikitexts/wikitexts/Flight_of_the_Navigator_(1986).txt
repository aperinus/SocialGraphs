Baker, Michael Burton, and Matt MacManus. It stars [[Joey Cramer]] as David Freeman, a 12-year-old boy who is abducted by an alien spaceship and transported from 1978 to 1986. It features an early film appearance by [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] as Carolyn McAdams, a key character who befriends David in a time of need.\n\nThe film's producers initially sent the project to [[Walt Disney Pictures]] in 1984, but the studio was unable to approve it and it was sent to [[Producers Sales Organization]], which made a deal with Disney to distribute it in the United States.<ref name=\"mark\"/> It was partially shot in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], and [[Norway]], being a coproduction with Norwegian company ''Viking Film''.<ref name=\"viking\"/>\n\nThe film is notable for being one of the first Hollywood films to use extensive [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects.  Specifically, it was the first use of image-based lighting, and an early use of [[morphing]] in a motion picture. It is also known to be one of the first Hollywood productions to feature an entirely [[electronic music]] film score, composed using a [[Synclavier]], one of the first digital multi-track recorders and samplers.\n\nThe film has since become a cult classic, and has a large cult following among [[science fiction]] and [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] fans. In September 2017, Walt Disney Pictures announced that a reboot of the film was in the works.<ref name=\"McNary\">{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/flight-of-the-navigator-reboot-joe-henderson-1202575383/|title='Flight of the Navigator' Reboot in Works With 'Lucifer' Showrunner|last=McNary|first=Dave|date=2017-09-28|work=Variety|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nOn July 4, 1978, in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], 12-year-old David Freeman walks through the woods to pick up his 8-year-old brother, Jeff, from a friend's house when he falls into a ravine and is knocked unconscious. When he comes to, eight years have passed and it is now 1986. He has not aged, and his appearance exactly matches his [[missing child]] poster. He is reunited with his aged parents and the now 16-year-old Jeff.\n\nMeanwhile, an alien spaceship crashes through power lines and is captured by [[NASA]]. Hospital tests on David's brainwaves reveal images of it. Dr. Louis Faraday, who has been studying it, persuades David to come to a NASA research facility for just 48 hours, promising him they can help learn what happened to him. Faraday discovers that his mind is full of alien technical manuals and star charts far exceeding NASA's research, and that he was taken to the planet Phaelon, 560 light years away, in just 2.2 hours (approx. 2,105,990.4 x c). Having travelled faster than light, he has experienced [[time dilation]], explaining how eight years have passed on Earth, but not for him. Faraday decides to keep him there to finish his investigation, breaking his 48-hour promise.\n\nFollowing a telepathic communication from the spaceship, David secretly boards it and meets its robotic commander, \"Trimaxion Drone Ship\" (\"Max\"), who calls him the \"Navigator\". They escape from the facility and Max tells David that his mission is to travel the galaxy collecting biological specimens for analysis on Phaelon before returning them to their homes. Phaelon's scientists discovered that [[Ten percent of the brain myth|humans only use 10% of their brain]] and, as an experiment, filled the remainder of David's with miscellaneous information. Max returned him to Earth, but not to his own time, having determined a trip back in time would be dangerous for a human. When Max crashed the spaceship, the computer's data was erased. So he needs the information in David's brain to return home.\n\nWhile Max prepares for a mind transfer, David meets other alien specimens on board and bonds with a \"Puckmaren\", a tiny bat-like creature that is the last of his kind after a comet destroyed his planet. During the mind transfer, Max contracts human emotions and behaves eccentrically. His and David's bickering trigger UFO reports in Tokyo and the US. Meanwhile, NASA intern Carolyn McAdams, who befriended David, tells his family about his escape in the spaceship, so Faraday has them confined to their house, and Carolyn is sent back to the facility.\n\nWhen the spaceship stops at a gas station, David calls Jeff, who sets off fireworks on the roof to locate their house. David and Max arrive there, but NASA agents have tracked the spaceship. Fearing institutionalization if he remains in 1986, David orders Max to return him to 1978, accepting the risk of vaporization. He awakes in the ravine, walks home, and finds everything as he left it. During the Fourth of July celebration, Jeff sees that the Puckmaren has stowed away in David's backpack. David tells him to keep it a secret, while Max flies home across the firework-lit sky, calling \"See you later, navigator!\".\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Joey Cramer]] as David Freeman\n* [[Paul Reubens]] as Voice of Max\n* [[Veronica Cartwright]] as Helen Freeman\n* [[Cliff DeYoung]] as Bill Freeman\n* [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] as Carolyn McAdams\n* [[Matt Adler]] as Jeff Freeman (16 Years Old)\n:* Albie Whitaker as Jeff Freeman (8 Years Old)\n* [[Howard Hesseman]] as Dr. Louis Faraday\n* [[Jonathan Sanger]] as Dr. Carr\n* [[Iris Acker]] as Janet Howard\n* [[Richard Liberty]] as Larry Howard\n* [[Raymond Forchion]] as Detective Banks\n* Keri Rogers as Jennifer Bradley\n\n===Casting===\n\nThe filmmakers held auditions for the role of David Freeman, Several actors auditioned for it, including [[Joaquin Phoenix]] and [[Chris O'Donnell]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.looper.com/651776/the-untold-truth-of-flight-of-the-navigator/ |title = The Untold Truth Of Flight Of The Navigator}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\nSome of the scenes with the Trimaxion Drone Ship were rendered in [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) by Omnibus Computer Animation, under the supervision of director [[Randal Kleiser]]'s brother, Jeff.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/14631/jeff-kleiser-discusses-the-early-cgi-of-flight-of-the-navigator |title=Jeff Kleiser Discusses the Early CGI of ''Flight of the Navigator'' |author=Anderson, Martin |publisher=[[Dennis Publishing|Den of Geek!]] |date=2009-07-15 |access-date=2016-01-15}}</ref> It was the first film to use [[reflection mapping]] to create realistic reflections on a simulated chrome surface.\n\nJeff Kleiser explained that Randal had been inspired by commercial work that he had done at his previous company, [[Digital Effects (studio)|Digital Effects]]: \"Jean Miller and Bob Hoffman had written a reflection mapping software that simulated a drop of water dripping from a faucet, which had refraction and reflection on the spout and it drips off.
