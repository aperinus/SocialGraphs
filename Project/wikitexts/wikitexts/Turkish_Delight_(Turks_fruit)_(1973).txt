He eventually cleans up his dingy studio, but only to trawl the streets of [[Amsterdam]] in search of random women whom he takes back home for sex. This combination of violent fantasies, [[promiscuity]] and occasional [[misogyny]] is not intrinsic to him, but rather the outcome of a distressing memory: his failed relationship with Olga Stapels. The film then flashes back two years to the time they first met.\n\nOlga picks Eric up when he is [[hitchhiking]], and they immediately have sex in her car. This first tryst is followed by a [[Traffic collision|traffic accident]], and Eric is initially prevented from seeing Olga again by her middle-class mother, who strongly dislikes him and blames him for the crash. However, the two lovers reconnect and start a passionate affair which, while opposed by her mother, is seen sympathetically by her easy-going father. They eventually get married, and Olga's mother and closest circle of friends grudgingly accept Eric.\n\nSome time later, Eric lands a 5000-[[Dutch guilder|guilder]] commission to prepare a sculpture for the garden of the hospital where his friend Paul works. Olga models for the statue, which is unveiled by the [[Juliana of the Netherlands|Dutch queen]]. The unveiling ceremony is successful for the hospital, but the artist and model are prevented from attending on the front line by the queen's [[security detail]] because of Olga's revealing dress. Out of frustration, Eric and Olga throw the [[maquette]]s into the canals of Amsterdam.\n\nOlga's father's dies from illness shortly thereafter. Instead of taking care of the Stapels family business, Eric then takes Olga back to [[Amsterdam]] where he continues his artistic career and she takes a job in a production line. This infuriates her mother, who feels that a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] sculptor earning little from occasional commissions is an unsuitable husband.\n\nTheir life together, while initially happy, is marred by bouts of strange behavior on Olga's behalf, including unexplainable [[Daydream|reveries]] and rampant [[impulsivity]]. This tendency reaches a pitch of conflict in a family gathering in a Chinese restaurant. Eric finds himself insidiously baited into following Olga to the party, where he witnesses her flirting openly with a family friend, with the overt complicity of the rest of the diners. This prompts Eric to vomit over the attendants and slap Olga. She then leaves Eric, who proceeds to trash his studio, destroying anything that reminded him of her. This brings the movie to the point where it opened, ending the [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]].\n\nEric is still obsessed with Olga. Her family refuses to let him visit her, until he says he has come to arrange a divorce. His short stay sours when Olga's mother walks in on them having rough sex, and he is banished from her life permanently. Olga later becomes engaged to a wealthy American and visits Eric to pick up the remainder of her things before leaving for the United States. Eric comes to terms with her departure, and his closure is symbolized by a minor subplot in which he rescues a wounded [[seagull]] and sets if free once its wing heals.\n\nSome time later, Eric walks into a commercial center and spots Olga, flamboyantly dressed and acting oddly. She reveals that her American experience was a disaster and that she is living with her mother again. She suddenly collapses and Eric takes her to Paul's hospital, where she is diagnosed as having a [[brain tumor]]. Surgical intervention to remove the entire tumor is not entirely successful, and her death becomes an inevitable matter of course. Eric brings her a [[wig]] and [[Turkish delight]], which is the only thing she will eat, as she fears harder food will break a loose tooth. Soon after, she has a seizure and dies. Eric walks outside, past his sculpture of Olga, and solemnly dumps her wig in a trash disposal.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Rutger Hauer en Monique van de Ven (1972).jpg|thumb|Rutger Hauer and Monique van de Ven in June 1972]]\n* [[Monique van de Ven]] as Olga Stapels\n* [[Rutger Hauer]] as Eric Vonk\n* [[:nl: Tonny Huurdeman|Tonny Huurdeman]] as Olga's Mother\n* Wim van den Brink as Olga's Father\n* [[Hans Boskamp]] as Shop Manager\n* [[Dolf de Vries]] as Paul\n* Manfred de Graaf as Henny\n* Dick Scheffer as Accountant\n* Marjol Flore as Tineke\n* Bert Dijkstra as Civil Servant\n\n==Production==\nFilming locations included [[Amsterdam]], [[Alkmaar]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Zaandam]] in the Netherlands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reelstreets.com/films/turks-fruit-aka-turkish-delight/|title=Bot Verification}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of submissions to the 46th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of Dutch submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0070842|title=Turkish Delight}}\n* {{AllMovie title|51242|Turkish Delight}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|id=turkish_delight|title=Turkish Delight}}\n\n{{Paul Verhoeven}}\n\n[[Category:1973 films]]\n[[Category:1973 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s erotic drama films]]\n[[Category:Dutch erotic drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s Dutch-language films]]\n[[Category:Dutch romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Erotic romance films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Dutch novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Paul Verhoeven]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Rob Houwer]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Amsterdam]]\n[[Category:Films about sculptors]]"}]}}}}
