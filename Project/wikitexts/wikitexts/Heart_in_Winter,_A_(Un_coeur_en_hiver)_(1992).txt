It stars [[Emmanuelle B\u00e9art]], [[Daniel Auteuil]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Dussollier]].  It was chosen to compete at the [[49th Venice International Film Festival]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Venezia, Libert\u00e0 Per Gli Autori |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1992/07/31/venezia-liberta-per-gli-autori.html?ref=search |access-date=29 April 2014|newspaper=[[La Repubblica]]|date=July 31, 1992}}</ref> where it won four awards, including tying for the Silver Lion. It was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the 1994 [[BAFTA]] awards.\n\nThe romantic drama was the second-to-last film made by French writer/director [[Claude Sautet]]. He would work with B\u00e9art again on his final feature, 1995's ''[[Nelly and Mr. Arnaud]]'' (original title ''Nelly et Monsieur Arnaud'').\n\n==Plot==\nHighly regarded violin restorer St\u00e9phane (Daniel Auteuil) works and plays squash with his longtime business partner Maxime (Andr\u00e9 Dussollier). After Maxime, who is married, begins romancing concert violinist Camille (B\u00e9art), St\u00e9phane is called in to do some urgent repairs on Camille's violin. Camille begins to fall for St\u00e9phane, and reveals the truth to Maxime. St\u00e9phane's cool reaction causes confusion for Camille, and she lashes out at him for denying his feelings.<ref>[http://independentfilmquarterly.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=357&Itemid=115 ''Independent Film Quarterly''].

A fourth Ravel composition not excerpted in the film, ''Berceuse sur le nom de Gabriel Faure'', is on the soundtrack album.
