Do not add fan fiction. --> is a 2006 American [[Sports film|sports]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by, and also starring, [[Sylvester Stallone]]. It is the sequel to ''[[Rocky V]]'' (1990) and is the sixth installment in the [[Rocky franchise|''Rocky'' franchise]]. It also stars [[Burt Young]] and [[Antonio Tarver]]. In the film, [[Rocky Balboa]] (Stallone), now an aging small restaurant owner, is challenged to an [[exhibition fight]] by hothead boxer Mason Dixon (Tarver). ''Rocky Balboa'' was Antonio Tarver's first and only film, and Stallone's first film as director since ''[[Rocky IV]]'' (1985).\n\nDevelopment for a sixth ''Rocky'' film began after Stallone expressed regret of the outcome of ''Rocky V'', which was viewed as a disappointing conclusion to the end of the franchise. ''Rocky Balboa'' includes references to characters and objects from previous installments, and Stallone was inspired by recent personal struggles and triumphs when writing the film.<ref name=\"EWRockyRoad\">{{cite magazine|last=Schwartz|first=Missy|title='Rocky' Road|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1570048,00.html|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=December 14, 2006|access-date=June 15, 2009}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] began in December 2005 and lasted until January 2006, with filming locations including [[Las Vegas]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[Los Angeles]]. In contrast to previous entries in the franchise, the fight choreography in ''Rocky Balboa'' was less scripted, featuring real punches thrown by Stallone and Tarver.\n\n''Rocky Balboa'' was theatrically released by [[MGM Distribution Co.]] and [[Sony Pictures Releasing]] in the United States on December 20, 2006, thirty years after the release of the [[Rocky|first film]]. ''Rocky Balboa'' received generally positive reviews, with praise for its screenplay, Stallone's performance, and heartfelt exploration of Balboa's character, with many critics labelling the film one of the best entries in the franchise. It grossed over $156 million worldwide, subverting expectations to rebound from the box office performance of its predecessor. A sequel and spin-off, '' [[Creed (film)|Creed]]'', was released in 2015.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\n\nDuring 2006, [[Rocky Balboa]], now in his 50s and retired from boxing, lives a quiet life as a widower, his wife [[Adrian Pennino|Adrian]] having died from cancer four years prior. He now runs a small but successful Italian restaurant named after her, where he regales patrons with tales from his past. He also battles personal demons involving his grief over Adrian's death and his eroding relationship with his son Robert, now a struggling corporate employee. [[Paulie Pennino|Paulie]], Rocky's best friend and brother-in-law, continues to support him whenever he can, but is guilt-ridden over his past poor treatment toward his late sister and accuses Rocky of living in the past.\n\nLate one night, Rocky meets a woman named Marie, who was once a troublesome young girl Rocky had escorted home 30 years ago. Marie now is a single parent of a teenage son named Stephenson and nicknamed \"Steps\", born out of wedlock. Rocky's friendship with Marie quickly blossoms over the following weeks and he meets and bonds with Steps, providing him with a much-needed buffer for his anguish.\n\nMeanwhile, on the professional boxing circuit, Mason \"The Line\" Dixon reigns as the undefeated yet unpopular heavyweight world champion, often ridiculed for having never fought a true contender. This leads to tension with the public and his promoters, and encourages him to return to his roots: the small gym he first trained in and his old trainer who sagely tells him that, inevitably, he will earn back his respect through a true opponent that will test him. [[ESPN]] later broadcasts a computer simulation of a fight between a younger Rocky and Mason\u2014likened to a modern-day version of [[The Super Fight]]\u2014that ends in a disputed KO victory for Balboa, further riling the champ. In contrast, the simulation inspires Rocky to take up boxing again, an intention that goes public when he successfully renews his boxing license. Dixon's promoters pitch the idea of holding a charity exhibition bout at the [[Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino]] in Las Vegas to bolster Dixon's floundering popularity. In the midst of this chaos, two men fire Paulie from his job.\n\nWith some hesitation, both men agree to the match, creating a media buzz that stabs at Rocky's age and Dixon's credibility. Robert later makes an effort to discourage Rocky from fighting, blaming his own personal failings on his father's celebrity shadow, but Rocky rebukes him with some profound advice: to succeed in life, \"it ain't about how hard you hit \u2013 it's about how hard you can ''get'' hit and keep moving forward,\" and blaming others will not help him. The next day, father and son meet over Adrian's grave and reconcile; Robert has quit his job to be at Rocky's side. \n\nRocky sets straight to training with [[Apollo Creed]]'s (and later his) old trainer, Duke, who quickly surmises that Rocky can only compete by building his strength and punching power as much as possible. On the day of the match, Dixon easily dominates the first round, only to injure his left hand on Rocky's hip in the second. Rocky then makes a dramatic comeback, knocking Mason down, and surprising the audience with his prowess and [[chin (boxing)|chin]] despite his age. The two combatants beat each other severely throughout the full 10 rounds, ending with both men still standing, although Rocky gets the last punch. Rocky thanks an appreciative Dixon for the match and tells him that he is a great champion, while the audience applauds the two fighters. The result is announced as Rocky exits the ring with his family and friends: a win for Dixon by a close split decision, but Rocky does not mind the outcome, and the crowd gives him a final standing ovation. Rocky returns home and visits Adrian's grave again, thanking her for helping him in spirit; \"Yo Adrian, we did it. We did it.\"\n\nAs the credits roll, an inset features people running up the [[Rocky Steps]] at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] in response to a call from the director to do so for the film.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Rocky characters}}\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[Rocky Balboa|Robert \"Rocky\" Balboa]], retired boxer and former two-time heavyweight champion.\n* [[Burt Young]] as [[Paulie Pennino]], Rocky's moody brother-in-law and best friend.\n* [[Antonio Tarver]] as Mason \"The Line\" Dixon, Rocky's opponent.

In the previous film, Rocky was diagnosed with brain damage and advised never to fight again. Stallone clarified this apparent inconsistency in an interview, remarking:\n\n<blockquote>When Rocky was diagnosed with brain damage, it must be noted that many athletes have a form of brain damage including football players, soccer players, and other individuals in contact sports such as rugby, etc. Rocky never went for a second opinion and yielded to his wife's wishes to stop. So with the advent of new research techniques into brain damage, Rocky was found to be normal among fighters, and he was suffering the results of a severe concussion. By today's standards Rocky Balboa would be given a clean bill of health for fighters.<ref name=\"AICNQA1\">{{cite web|author=Moriaty|url=https://www.aintitcool.com/node/30861|title=Round One With Sylvester Stallone Q&A!! |publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]] |date=December 1, 2006|access-date=June 15, 2009}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Pre-production===\n''Rocky Balboa'' gives nods to previous installments via the casting. The most obvious is the return of Stallone, Young, and Burton\u2014the only actors to portray the same characters in all six installments. Tarver's appearance in the film marks the sixth time an active professional boxer has appeared in the series. Previously, [[Joe Frazier]] (''Rocky''), [[Pedro Lovell]] (''Rocky''), [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]] (''Rocky II''), [[Tommy Morrison]] (''Rocky V'') and Michael Williams (''Rocky V'') have appeared in the series. Stallone initially wanted [[Roy Jones Jr.|Roy Jones, Jr.]] to portray Dixon, but after Jones did not return Stallone's phone calls, he tapped Antonio Tarver to fill the role.<ref name=\"StallIssues\">{{cite news|author=DHB |title=Stallone has Issues with Roy Jones Jr |url=http://www.doghouseboxing.com/chee/chee_121606.htm |publisher=Doghouse Boxing |date=December 16, 2006 |access-date=June 15, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221152824/http://www.doghouseboxing.com/chee/chee_121606.htm |archive-date=February 21, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Tarver accidentally knocked out Stallone during the filming of one of the segments of the fight.<ref name=\"OutCold\">{{cite news|url=http://movies.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1070546.php/Stallone_knocked_out_on_Rocky_set|title=Stallone knocked out on 'Rocky' set|publisher=[[Monsters and Critics]]|date=December 21, 2005|access-date=June 15, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317114819/http://movies.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1070546.php/Stallone_knocked_out_on_Rocky_set|archive-date=2008-03-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe character Marie appeared in the original ''Rocky''; she was portrayed by Jodi Letizia. For the final film, Marie is portrayed by [[Geraldine Hughes]]. (Although Letizia did reprise the role for ''Rocky V'', the sole scene in which she appeared was deleted. In it, Marie was homeless on the streets of Philadelphia.) Another recognizable character who appeared in the previous five films, sportscaster [[Stu Nahan]], provided the commentary for the computer-generated fight between Dixon and Balboa. Nahan was part of the ringside commentary team during all the bouts in the first three films and the Apollo Creed-Ivan Drago fight in ''Rocky IV''. He was diagnosed with lymphoma during the ''Rocky Balboa'' filming, though, and died on December 26, 2007.<ref name=\"NahanObit\">{{cite news|url=http://cbs2.com/sports/Stu.Nahan.2.618339.html |title=Retired L.A.

[[Jim Lampley]], [[Larry Merchant]], and [[Max Kellerman]] comprise the ringside broadcast team (all three are commentators for ''[[HBO World Championship Boxing|HBO Boxing]]''). Sportswriters such as [[Bert Sugar]], Bernard Fernandez and Steve Springer also appear. As for actual boxers, [[Mike Tyson]] (who had retired by the film's release) makes a cameo appearance, taunting Dixon as the fighter enters the ring. [[Lou DiBella]], a real-life boxing promoter, portrays himself as Dixon's promoter. Several of ESPN's personalities also portray themselves. ''[[SportsCenter]]'' anchor [[Brian Kenny (sportscaster)|Brian Kenny]] is the host of the fictional ''Then and Now'' series, while ''[[Cold Pizza]]'' and ''[[1st and 10 (ESPN TV series)|1st and 10]]'' hosts [[Jay Crawford]], [[Dana Jacobson]], [[Skip Bayless]] and [[Woody Paige]] also appear. Ring announcer [[Michael Buffer]] appeared as himself, as did referee [[Joe Cortez]].\n\nRegarding his decision not to have [[Talia Shire]] reprise her role as [[Adrian Pennino|Adrian]], Stallone told ''USA Today'' that, \"in the original script, she was alive. But it just didn't have the same dramatic punch. I thought, 'What if she's gone?' That would cut Rocky's heart out and drop him down to ground zero.\"<ref name=\"MythicalUSA\">{{cite news|last=Keck|first=William|title=Forever yo: Talia Shire's Adrian|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2006-12-25-talia-shire_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |date=December 25, 2006|access-date=June 15, 2009}}</ref> Shire herself said that, in her view, \"The film has great regard for the process of mourning.

The scene where Rocky and his son were talking while walking down a quiet block was filmed between 20th\u201321st Streets on Walnut, just after dawn on a Sunday morning.\nThe production budget on the 38-day shoot was projected to be $23.5 million.\n\n=== Cinematography and fight choreography ===\nWhile the dramatic portions of the movie are shot in an obviously cinematic style, the bout between Balboa and Dixon is shot in a number of different ways. The lead-in to the bout, as well as the first two rounds, are shot in a style similar to a major pay-per-view broadcast. Clips from fights in previous ''Rocky'' movies are used during the introductory teaser to introduce Balboa, while stock footage from actual Tarver fights, as well as footage from Dixon's previous fight (shown at the beginning of the film) are used as clips for Dixon's part of the teaser. The fight itself was shot in High Definition to further enhance the TV-style look of the fight.<ref name=\"AICNQA2\">{{cite news|last=Tran |first=An |url=http://www.arri.de/news/newsletter/articles/1220/rocky_balboa.html |title=Going the Distance: Clark Mathis, Lenses Rocky Balboa |publisher=[[Arri]] |date=December 2006 |access-date=June 15, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114055614/http://www.arri.de/news/newsletter/articles/1220/rocky_balboa.html |archive-date=January 14, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter the first two rounds, the bout is shot in a more \"cinematic\" style, reminiscent of the way the fights in the other ''Rocky'' films were shot. However, unlike the other films in the series, the fight is less choreographed and more improvised than previous installments and is closer to an actual boxing match than a choreographed fight.<ref name=\"ClimbsCanvas\">{{cite news|last=Zwecker|first=Bill|url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/movies/172402,CST-FTR-rocky14.article|archive-url=https://archive.today/20070814032746/http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/movies/172402,CST-FTR-rocky14.article|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 14, 2007|title=\"Rocky\" climbs off the canvas|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=December 14, 2006|access-date=June 15, 2009}}</ref> This is a departure from the previous films, where every punch, feint, and step was carefully scripted and practiced.<ref name=\"TimeWinner\">{{cite news|last1=Dutka|first1=Elaine|first2=J.D.|last2=Reed|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950695-1,00.html|title=Winner and Still Champion|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=June 14, 1982|pages=1\u20136|access-date=June 15, 2009|archive-date=November 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103135337/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950695-1,00.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the behind-the-scenes documentary portions of the film's DVD, there were slight continuity problems during the filming of the fight. This was said to have been due to the fact that real punches were thrown by both Stallone and Tarver, resulting in some swelling and nosebleeds earlier than scripted. The DVD release features an alternate ending in which Rocky wins the fight.\n\n==Music==\nComposed by [[Academy Award]] winner [[Bill Conti]], the ''Rocky Balboa'' [[film score]] is both an updated composition of ''Rocky'' music and a tribute to the music that has been featured in previous Rocky films. Conti, who has acted as composer on every Rocky film except ''Rocky IV'', chose to compose the score almost entirely from musical themes used in the previous movies. Only one original theme was written specifically for ''Rocky Balboa'' and that is the theme written to represent the character of Marie.\n\nThe roughly 40-minute score was recorded in the summer of 2006 at Capitol Studios in [[Hollywood, California]]. Conti chose to pre-record the string, brass and piano tracks and then have those tracks mixed with the work of a 44 piece orchestra which he conducted. He also performed all of the piano work himself which is something he has done with each movie for which he has composed the score. Stallone also was involved in every part of the process and attended several of the recording sessions.<ref name=\"ScoreSession\">{{cite web|last=Goldwasser|first=Dan|url=http://www.scoringsessions.com/news/54/|title=Bill Conti scores Rocky Balboa|publisher=Scoring Sessions|date=June 14, 2006|access-date=June 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the score, the film features original tracks performed by [[Natasha Bedingfield]], [[Three 6 Mafia]], and [[Frank Stallone]] as well as classic tracks such as [[Frank Sinatra|Frank Sinatra's]] \"[[High Hopes (1959 song)|High Hopes]]\" and [[The Miracles]]' \"[[Ooh Baby Baby]]\".<ref name=\"CreditList\">{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1809278368/cast|title=Rocky Balboa (2006) \u2013 Cast and Credits|publisher=[[Yahoo!

On December 26, 2006, [[Capitol Records]] released a CD titled ''[[Rocky Balboa: The Best of Rocky]]'' which had a logo and cover art that was identical to the film's theatrical poster.\n\nThe CD itself contains short dialogue clips and musical tracks, some of which are remixes, from all the ''Rocky'' films. Notable though is that only three of its nineteen total tracks are from the ''Rocky Balboa'' film: two dialogue tracks and the Three 6 Mafia song \"It's a Fight\" (the UK version contains the additional track \"Still Here\" by [[Natasha Bedingfield]]). This has led some to categorize the CD as a compilation while others suggest that it is a soundtrack and that the use of past material simply reflects the film's extensive use of flashbacks.\n\nRelevant to this debate is the absence of any compositions by ''Rocky IV'' composer [[Vince DiCola]], except for the song \"Hearts on Fire\", co-written by DiCola, Ed Fruge and Joe Esposito. DiCola is the only person, other than Bill Conti, to act as composer on a ''Rocky'' film and his work was used extensively on the 1991 compilation CD ''The Rocky Story: Songs from the Rocky Movies''. The missing DiCola tracks are the only tracks on the 1991 CD that are not present on the new CD which indicates an effort to use only ''Rocky Balboa'' composer Conti's tracks.<ref name=\"Epinions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.epinions.com/content_305002352260 |title=Rocky Balboa: The Best of Rocky |publisher=Epinions.com |access-date=June 15, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626173510/http://www.epinions.com/content_305002352260 |archive-date=June 26, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Distribution===\n''Rocky Balboa'' represents a partnership between [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Revolution Studios]], and [[Columbia Pictures]] (Columbia's corporate parent [[Sony]] held a 20% stake in MGM).
