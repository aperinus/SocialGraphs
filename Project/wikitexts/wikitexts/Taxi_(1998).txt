It is the first installment in the [[Taxi (film series)|''Taxi'' film series]]. It has four sequels, ''[[Taxi 2]]'', ''[[Taxi 3]]'', ''[[Taxi 4]]'' and ''[[Taxi 5]]'' and one English-language remake, ''[[Taxi (2004 film)|Taxi]]'' (2004). It also provided the premise for the 2014 American television show, ''[[Taxi Brooklyn]]''.\n\nIn [[Spain]], the film was released with the title '''''Taxi Express''''', in order to distinguish it from [[Taxi (disambiguation)#Film|other films with the same name]].<ref>[https://www.filmaffinity.com/es/film687121.html Taxi Express]. [[FilmAffinity]] Spain</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nDaniel Morales ([[Samy Naceri]]) is a highly talented driver living in [[Marseille]], [[France]], who has little regard for traffic laws and the police, and is in a loving relationship with his girlfriend Lilly ([[Marion Cotillard]]). He leaves his job as a delivery man at local pizza parlor \"Pizza Joe\" to become a [[Taxicab driver|taxi driver]], driving his white custom [[Peugeot 406|1997 Peugeot 406]], which is equipped with various racing modifications that are mechanically concealed.<ref name=\"reelrundown\">{{cite web |last1=Cox |first1=Benjamin |title=Should I Watch..?

No one takes him seriously at work, including police sergeant Petra ([[Emma Sj\u00f6berg]]), towards whom he harbors an unrequited crush. Commissioner Gibert ([[Bernard Farcy]]) soon briefs the officers on a new case: a German gang that has successfully committed a series of high profile robberies throughout Europe, and has now arrived in Marseille. The gang is known for their efficiency, skilled driving, and their use of red [[Mercedes-Benz 500E]] cars as escape vehicles. Anticipating the gang's next move, Gibert places police officers around the targeted bank. After the robbers enter the bank, \u00c9milien accidentally causes a [[multi-vehicle collision]] and a gun fight with the French Minister's escort convoy, allowing the Germans to escape.\n\nThe next day, \u00c9milien decides to take a taxi to work and rides with Daniel. Not knowing his fare's occupation, Daniel shows off his car and breaks several traffic laws. \u00c9milien detains Daniel, but then asks for his help with catching the German gang in exchange for returning Daniel's license - desperate for respect and Petra's attention. Looking at photos of the getaway cars, Daniel concludes that the tires come from a garage owned by Kruger, the only German mechanic in town. Daniel reluctantly joins \u00c9milien at a stakeout of the garage, where they spot the German robbers. The next morning, \u00c9milien tries to interrogate Kruger, who opens fire at the duo and escapes.\n\nThe police locate the gang's next target and manage to shoot a tracking device onto one of the cars. However, the gang stops at a secluded garage and repaints the cars silver, inadvertently sabotaging the tracking device and allowing them to escape again. \u00c9milien then learns that he had left the stove on at his flat and burned it down, forcing him and his mother to stay at Daniel's place. Eager to get rid of \u00c9milien, Daniel correctly deduces the gang's repaint strategy, and through a friend he tracks the robbers to a race track. Daniel provokes the gang into a race and wins, later inspring \u00c9milien to approach Petra romantically. The duo then become friends, and devise a plan to finally catch the gang red-handed.\n\nThe next day, having duplicated the control keys to twenty traffic lights throughout the city, \u00c9milien provides Daniel with a closed radio line. Daniel recruits his old co-workers from Pizza Joe, to whom \u00c9milien distributes the keys and walkie-talkies. After the gang drives away from another robbery, Daniel follows them and successfully taunts the Germans into another race. As the delivery men use the traffic lights to clear a path for the cars, the cars drive onto the freeway. Daniel then speeds towards a bridge that is under construction, and slams on the brake; the gang's cars jump over the gap and lands on the other side, only to discover that they are trapped on an incomplete bridge section.\n\nAfter the gang is arrested, Daniel and \u00c9milien are given medals by the police commissioner, and \u00c9milien begins dating Petra. The film ends with Daniel competing at the [[French Grand Prix]] in a [[Formula 3000]], sponsored by (to Daniel's dismay) the Marseille Police.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Samy Naceri]]: Daniel Morales\n* [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Diefenthal]]: \u00c9milien Coutant-Kerbalec\n* [[Marion Cotillard]]: Lilly Bertineau\n* [[Emma Sj\u00f6berg]]: Petra\n* [[Richard Sammel]]: German gang chief\n* [[Bernard Farcy]]: Commissaire G\u00e9rard Gibert\n* [[\u00c9douard Montoute]]: Alain Tr\u00e9sor\n* [[Tara R\u00f6mer]]: \u00c9milien's colleague\n* Niels Dubost: Karl, second German thief\n* Frank Libert: third German thief\n* Stephan Crisz: fourth German thief\n* {{ill|Manuela Gourary|fr|Manuela Gourary}}: Camille Coutant-Kerbalec\n* {{ill|Georges Neri|fr|Georges Neri}}: Joe\n* Dan Herzberg: Paulo\n* S\u00e9bastien Pons: Akim\n* Malek B\u00e9char: Marco\n* Guy Quang: pizza deliverer\n* Maurice Murcia: retired taxi driver\n* Sabine Bail: prefecture employee\n* {{ill|S\u00e9bastien Thi\u00e9ry|fr|S\u00e9bastien Thi\u00e9ry}}: driving license examiner\n* \u00c9ric B\u00e9renger: butcher\n* {{ill|Philippe du Janerand|fr|Philippe du Janerand}}: customer in a rush\n* Christophe Fesquet: first cop\n* {{ill|G\u00e9rard Vantaggioli|fr|G\u00e9rard Vantaggioli}}: second cop\n* Christian Mazucchini: police elite driver\n* Guillaume Lanson: redneck sniper\n* G\u00e9rard Dubouche: Gibert's driver\n* Ludovic Lavaissi\u00e8re : Pizzaiolo  }}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nLuc Besson came up with the idea for the movie in 1996, but he was too busy with ''[[The Fifth Element]]'' to direct it at the time, so he decided to simply produce it. He presented his idea to his usual production company [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]], but Gaumont had no trust in the project and turned Besson down. Besson went to two old friends, Mich\u00e8le and Laurent P\u00e9tin, who headed the small production company ARP. They came to an agreement on a 50/50 split and Besson began searching for a director. He knew G\u00e9rard Pir\u00e8s from a long ago, but Pir\u00e8s hadn't directed a film in 15 years. He had however, been directing commercials and especially ones for [[Peugeot]], making him a good fit in the end. For budgetary reasons the location was chosen as Marseille and the actors relative unknowns at the time. Better known actors were approached but they turned the project down. The young unknown actors were explained to financiers such as [[Canal+]] as being easier to identify with for young audience and also being a bet on the future.<ref name=\"lexpress\">{{cite news |last1=Carri\u00e8re |first1=Christophe |title=Luc Besson et la saga Taxi (\u00e9pisode 1) |url=https://www.lexpress.fr/culture/cinema/luc-besson-la-saga-taxi-episode-1_1997760.html |access-date=5 February 2020 |publisher=L'Express |date=6 April 2018}}</ref> The main music theme is based on [[Misirlou]], a popular song of Eastern Mediterranean origin.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nIn terms of box office admissions, the ''Taxi'' series is one of the most successful French franchises ever.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/article/VR1117943112?categoryid=1019&cs=1&query=taxi&display=taxi|title=Gauls hail a cab with fourth 'Taxi'|author=Alison James|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=14 May 2006|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217223457/http://variety.com/article/VR1117943112?categoryid=1019&cs=1&query=taxi&display=taxi|archive-date=17 February 2012}}</ref> The first film was the fourth most successful film in France for the year with 6.4 million admissions and a gross of $39.3 million.<ref>{{cite book |editor=[[Peter Cowie]] |date=1999 |title=The Variety Almanac 1999|publisher=[[Boxtree Ltd]] |page=50 |isbn=0-7522-2454-9}}</ref> It had 2.2 million admissions abroad.<ref name=\"cineuropa\">{{cite news |last1=Lemercier |first1=Fabien |title=Taxi franchise gets into gear |url=https://cineuropa.org/en/newsdetail/65264/ |access-date=5 February 2020 |publisher=Cineuropa |date=28 June 2006}}</ref> The film also had very good TV ratings with 12 millions viewers on [[TF1 Group|TF1]].<ref name=\"cineuropa\"/>\n\n===Critical response===\nAlmar Haflidason, reviewing the film for [[BBC]], gave it three stars out of five, describing that there was \"fun to be had from this film when it's in motion, but the script is a real blow out.\"<ref name=bbc>{{cite news |last1=Haflidason |first1=Almar |title=Taxi (1998) |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/06/25/taxi_1998_review.shtml |publisher=BBC |date=25 June 2001 |access-date=5 February 2020}}</ref> In a research article for the journal [[French Cultural Studies]], Ipek A.
