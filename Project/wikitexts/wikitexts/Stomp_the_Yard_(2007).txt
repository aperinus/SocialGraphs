Directed by [[Sylvain White]], ''Stomp the Yard'' centers on DJ Williams, a college student at a fictional [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically Black university]] who pledges to join a fictional [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|Greek-letter fraternity]]. The film's central conflict involves DJ's fraternity competing in various [[stepping (African-American)|stepping]] competitions against a rival fraternity from the same school. The film's script was written by [[Robert Adetuyi]], working from an original draft by [[Gregory Anderson (screenwriter)|Gregory Ramon Anderson]]. The film was originally titled ''Steppin''', but to avoid confusion over the [[2006 in film|2006]] film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]'', the title was changed. [[Delta Sigma Theta]] along with other sororities like Gamma Theta were in the movie.\n\nThe film stars [[Columbus Short]], [[Meagan Good]], [[Darrin Henson]], [[Brian J. White|Brian White]], [[Laz Alonso]], and [[Valarie Pettiford]], with [[Harry Lennix]], and, in their film debuts, R&B singers [[Ne-Yo]] & [[Chris Brown]]. ''Stomp the Yard'' was filmed in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]], on the campuses of [[Morris Brown College]], [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], [[Morehouse College]], and [[Clark Atlanta University]], and in the [[MAK Historic District]] of [[Decatur, Georgia|Decatur]], Georgia. Elsewhere Short, Alonso and Brown had also starred together in the film ''[[This Christmas (film)|This Christmas]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n\nDJ Williams is a young man in inner-city [[Los Angeles]]. He and his younger brother Duron compete in local dance competitions as members of a crew known as the \"Goon Squad\". During the battle there are backs and forths, but in the end of the battle the Goon Squad win a cash-prize, and Sphere, the leader of The Thug Unit goes all in for a double or nothing battle, which DJ accepts much to the dismay of his brother who knows that if the opposing crew leader thinks he got hustled the crew won't be able to spend the money they win. The Goon Squad wins the second battle and the losing home crew responds by ambushing DJ and his crewmates after the show. A fight breaks out, and the leader of the rival crew starts beating up DJ. Duron pushes him away and starts fighting him. The rival pulls out a gun and shoots and kills Duron, devastating DJ.\n\nAfter DJ is arrested and convicted of assault, his mother, (wanting him to avoid prison) sends him to live with his aunt Jackie and uncle Nate in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, where he is to attend [[HBCU|historically black]] Truth University. Nate, the [[physical plant]] director at Truth, aims to teach DJ responsibility and puts him to work doing maintenance as part of a [[Cooperative education|work-study]] program.\n\nDJ sees April Palmer, to whom he is immediately attracted. After registration, he moves into his dorm room, where he meets his new roommate Rich Brown. Rich meets DJ at a [[Stepping (African-American)|stepping]] competition on the green between the Truth chapters of rival [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternities]] Theta Nu Theta and Mu Gamma Xi. The Mu Gamma Xi crew, seven-time national stepping champions, easily steals the show until DJ sees April across the way and runs right through their step line in an attempt to speak to her.\n\nThat night, DJ, Rich, Byron, Paul and East go out to a local club called the Phoenix for the Rep Your City event. Hoping to impress April and upstage Grant and the Gammas (all of whom are also in attendance), DJ takes to the floor. Despite the animosity between DJ and Grant, the Gammas recognize his skills as a dancer and their chapter president Zeke invites him to pledge for Mu Gamma Xi. DJ turns down both Zeke's offer as well as an offer from the Theta Nu Theta chapter's leader Sylvester.\n\nAfter learning that April is a student history tutor, DJ signs himself up for tutoring so that he can spend time with her. The two slowly begin a friendship and DJ takes April out to dinner. During their date, April discusses the importance of [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|black fraternities and sororities]] with DJ, and tells him to visit Heritage Hall on the campus' Greek Row.\n\nThe next day, DJ learns about the significant number of African-American historical figures and celebrities who were members of various Greek-letter organizations, and decides to pledge for the Theta chapter along with Rich and their friend Noel. After \"crossing over\" to become official Theta members, DJ, Rich, and Noel join the Thetas' step crew.\n\nWhile having dinner, April breaks up with Grant due to his arrogant and selfish behavior and his failure to know anything about her, particularly that green is her favorite color. She grows closer to DJ and they eventually become a couple. While at practice, DJ, Rich, Noel and other new members realize the step dance moves are old fashioned and aren't good enough to win the stepping competition. So they decide to take the time to learn fresher moves. Sly then gathers his older members and challenges DJ and the rest to an old school vs. new school stepping contest. DJ blows the contest due to his showboating. They remind DJ, much like Duron did, that it is about the team and not about him. DJ apologizes to the entire fraternity and is quickly forgiven. Sly also requests that DJ show the team some of his street moves.\n\nA few days before the competition, Grant stumbles upon DJ's file and discovers his assault record and presents it to the board. The board suspends DJ for not disclosing his criminal record. Dr. Palmer, who is April's father, calls in DJ to his office. He says he is willing to lift his suspension on the condition that DJ  stays away from April. DJ declines the ultimatum and walks away. DJ then tells Nate and Jackie about the suspension. They then reveal that Jackie dated Dr. Palmer until she met Nate and there has been some animosity between Nate and Palmer ever since. Jackie confronts Palmer about DJ's suspension and Palmer claims he is only protecting April, who then confronts her father about the situation, having been listening from outside the door. Dr. Palmer reinstates DJ, deciding that he would rather deal with DJ in April's life than to lose April in his.\n\nDJ's suspension is finally lifted, and he rejoins the Thetas to compete alongside them against the Gammas in the stepping competition. Both teams are tied at the end and it is brought into sudden death rules to determine a winner. Unknown to DJ and the Thetas, the Gammas had recorded DJ practicing his moves prior to the competition. Going first, Grant uses some of DJ\u2019s moves from the videotape. After he finishes, DJ matches Grant move for move, then finishes with Duron's signature move, something the Gammas didn't get on tape. The Thetas finally defeat the Gammas. April goes on stage to hug and kiss DJ. While celebrating their victory, DJ is still wearing Duron's gloves, and he kisses his fist and throws it in the air in honor of his brother. The Thetas then do their new cheer and have their picture taken where it is hung in the Heritage Hall.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Columbus Short]] as Darnell James \"D.J.\" Williams, a gifted street dancer who starts as a selfish loner.\n* [[Meagan Good]] as April Palmer, D.J.'s love interest, and Dr. Palmer's daughter.\n* [[Ne-Yo]] as Rich Brown, D.J.'s roommate.\n* [[Darrin Henson]] as Grant, the star stepper of Truth University and D.J.'s adversary.\n* [[Harry J.
