Loosely based on the [[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|1980s animated television series of the same name]], the film stars [[Matthew Broderick]] as the title character, [[Rupert Everett]] as Dr. Claw, [[Michelle Trachtenberg]] as Penny and [[Dabney Coleman]] as Chief Quimby. Three new characters were introduced such as Dr. Brenda Bradford (played by [[Joely Fisher]]), Mayor Wilson (played by [[Cheri Oteri]]) and the Gadgetmobile (voiced by [[D. L. Hughley]]). The film tells the story of how Inspector Gadget and Dr. Claw came to be. It was filmed in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]; [[Baton Rouge]], [[Louisiana]]; and [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], with the castle-like main tower of Pittsburgh's [[PPG Place]] playing a central role.\n\nProduced by [[Caravan Pictures]] and [[DIC Entertainment]] (which was owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] at the time of production), the film was released theatrically by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] on July 23, 1999. It was the last film produced by [[Caravan Pictures]], before the company merged into [[Spyglass Entertainment]]. It was also dedicated to the memory of production designer Michael White who died on January 19, 1999 in Los Angeles during production of the film at the age of 36.\n\nThe film had a worldwide gross of $134 million against a $90 million budget, while also receiving negative reviews from critics, who gave little praise towards the acting, but criticized the screenplay, visual effects, humor, and perceived lack of faithfulness to the source material (particularly when Dr. Claw shows his face). It lost the studio approximately $30 million. It was followed by the 2003 [[direct-to-video]] sequel ''[[Inspector Gadget 2]]'', though only D. L. Hughley reprised his role as the voice of the Gadgetmobile.\n\n==Plot==\nJohn Brown lives in Riverton, Ohio, with his niece Penny and her pet [[beagle]] Brain. Dreaming of becoming a police officer, John works as a [[security guard]] for the Bradford robotics laboratory. Artemus Bradford and his daughter Brenda are designing a lifelike robotic foot as part of the Gadget Program, designed to add android officers to the Riverton Police Department. Sanford Scolex, a tycoon, steals the foot to build an army of androids from its technology, assassinating Artemus in the process. John chases after Scolex's [[limousine]] in his hatchback, but both vehicles crash. John is left for dead by getting blown up in his car by Scolex's Dynamite stick disguised as a cigar, but a [[bowling ball]] launched by the explosive blast from the destroyed car lands in the limo and crushes Scolex's left hand. Scolex receives a mechanical claw from his associate Kramer, taking on the alias \u201cClaw.\u201d\n\nBrenda decides to make John, who nearly died from the intensely heavy-injuries from the fiery car explosion, the first test subject for the Gadget Program. John is transformed into a crimefighting cyborg, with the alias of \u201cInspector Gadget,\u201d who is powered by a control chip. John is given an orientation from Brenda, which goes horribly awry, and he is also given a lesson from a [[guru]]. The lesson ends in failure, however, when John accidentally [[emasculation|emasculates]] the guru. He is helped by the Gadgetmobile, a robotic car with a chatty [[Artificial intelligence|AI]], and one day, despite initially struggling to use his new gadgets, Gadget manages to stop two criminals who were trying to rob a car.\n\nAt a [[Ball (dance party)|charity ball]], Scolex approaches Brenda, having known her at [[Harvard]], inviting her to work for him in her own laboratory. Brenda accepts, unaware that Scolex plans to steal her technological ideas and designs. Unimpressed with Gadget, police chief Quimby assigns him to menial assignments rather than investigate Artemus\u2019 murder. Upset at not being taken seriously, Gadget investigates on his own, finding a piece of scrap metal which he later connects to Scolex, with help from Penny.\n\nClaw uses Brenda's research to build his own [[Android (robot)|android]], \u201cRobo-Gadget,\u201d sending him out on a rampage across Riverton to frame the real Gadget. Gadget himself infiltrates Claw's lab to recover the foot, but is caught and deactivated when Claw breaks his chip. Claw's minion Sykes dumps Gadget in a junkyard, then is tasked to dispose of the foot. Brenda encounters her own robotic doppelganger, Robo-Brenda, who confirms Claw stole the foot and murdered her father. Brenda, Penny, Brain, and the Gadgetmobile track Gadget to a junkyard. A kiss from Brenda awakens Gadget, proving his will can control his new body, regardless of whether the chip is needed or not.\n\nAfter dropping Penny and Brain off at home, Gadget and Brenda chase Claw and Robo-Gadget's limo. Gadget and Robo-Gadget fall off the roof and duel on a bridge, until Gadget removes the latter's head, tossing it into the river, though Robo-Gadget's body runs off. Brenda crashes the Gadgetmobile into Claw's limo, but is taken prisoner. Claw tries to escape in a helicopter, but Gadget appears using his helicopter hat to intercept. Claw destroys it, and Gadget is stuck hanging from the landing skis. Gadget deconstructs a pen that is in his finger (one of his gadgets) and launches the metal ink chamber, sending it bouncing around and making it hit the button on Claw's claw, causing it to clamp shut and break the joystick of the helicopter and send the helicopter out of control. Brenda leaps out of the helicopter onto Gadget's back, but they fall down the side of Scolex's skyscraper, using a parasol to land safely. Claw parachutes down, but lands in the Gadgetmobile and is captured by it. The police arrive to arrest Gadget, but Penny appears with a repentant and reformed Sykes, who confesses his boss's crimes to the police. Saluted and acknowledged by Quimby as an actual member of the police force, Gadget departs with Brenda and Penny, as Claw vows revenge as he is taken away by the cops. Gadget begins a relationship with Brenda.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as [[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|John Brown/Inspector Gadget/Robo-Gadget]]\n* [[Rupert Everett]] as Sanford Scolex/Dr. Claw\n* [[Joely Fisher]] as Dr. Brenda Bradford/RoboBrenda\n* [[Michelle Trachtenberg]] as Penny Brown\n* [[Dabney Coleman]] as Chief Frank Quimby\n* [[D.

It has an artificial intelligence with a male persona. Like most anthropomorphic cars, \"his\" front bumper is his mouth and he has eyes in his headlights. However, unlike those cars, who have two eyes, he has four. He also has a face on a computer screen on the dashboard and a license plate that reads \"GADGET\". Among other things, he can camouflage himself, has a radar system to track Gadget's location (and other people's as well), can extend his tires upwards, has retractable jail bars in his back seat (for transporting criminals), a [[vending machine]] (options on this include [[Skittles (confectionery)|Skittles]], [[M&M's]], [[Surge (drink)|Surge]], [[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]], [[Coca-Cola]] and [[McDonald's]]), police lights hidden in the hood that mechanically move onto the windshield, and a [[jet engine]] he keeps in his trunk. His artificial intelligence has a laid-back personality. The Gadgetmobile openly breaks the law constantly (he is a particular fan of backturns), but claims it is okay: \"Speed limits are for cars, not the Gadgetmobile.\" Comedian [[D. L. Hughley]] provides his voice.\n\n===Music===\nThe soundtrack of the film, composed by [[John Debney]], contains the singles \"[[All Star (song)|All Star]]\" by [[Smash Mouth]] and \"[[I'll Be Your Everything (Youngstown song)|I'll Be Your Everything]]\" by the [[boy band]] [[Youngstown (band)|Youngstown]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141369/soundtrack | title=Inspector Gadget (1999) Soundtracks Soundtrack Credits | work=[[IMDb]] | access-date=October 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\n''Inspector Gadget'' was released on VHS and DVD on December 7, 1999,<ref>{{cite web|first=Donovan|last=Whitworth|url=http://www.videostoremag.com/contents/index.cfm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991004124827/http://www.videostoremag.com/contents/index.cfm|title=Walt Disney Home Video's 'Inspector Gadget' Springing to Sellthrough in Time for Holiday Sales|website=videostoremag.com|archive-date=October 4, 1999|date=September 24, 1999|access-date=October 14, 2019}}</ref> and re-released on DVD May 27, 2003 by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Walt Disney Home Entertainment]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nDespite negative reviews from critics and fans of the 1980s cartoon series themselves, the film was a moderate box office success with a worldwide gross of $134.4 million worldwide, against a budget of $90 million.
