Macy]], and [[Kristen Bell]]. It was released in the United States and Canada on March 12, 2004.<ref name=\"Nadel2012\">{{cite book|last=Nadel|first=Ira|title=David Mamet: A Life in the Theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4fzHAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA232|date=16 July 2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-37872-8|pages=232\u2013233}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nRobert Scott is a former [[United States Marine Corps]] [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] [[master gunnery sergeant]], acting as a selection cadre member for [[Delta Force]]. While observing an exercise designed to evaluate Delta candidates, Scott meets a recruit, Curtis, as well as Sergeant Jacqueline Black, a knife fighting instructor.\n\nScott is drawn into a clandestine operation to find Laura Newton, the [[President of the United States|President]]'s daughter, who is missing. He and Curtis go first to the beach house of one of Laura's professors, with whom she is said to have a relationship. They find neither person there but find two unidentified men who react aggressively, leading Curtis, who has taken up position outside with a sniper's rifle, to shoot one of the men. Scott quickly kills the other. Another lead takes them to a bar where girls are recruited as prostitutes, and Scott's team follows a middleman from the bar to a brothel that funnels some of these girls to an international sex slavery ring. The madam gives them a contact number leading to a pay phone.\n\nCalls placed to the pay phone are traced to Tariq Asani, a Lebanese national currently in federal prison. They plan to intercept Asani during a prisoner transport for medical treatment and gain information from him about the sex trafficking operation.\n\nWhen the car carrying Asani and another prisoner stops en route to its destination, Scott shows up and appears to kill the transport guard, then kills the other prisoner who was on death row. He spares Asani when Asani says he can get them on a plane out of the country that night and confirms the sex slavery ring is based in [[Dubai]].\n\nScott stops at a convenience store to relay the information to the team. Curtis provides him with more ammunition, but Asani, waiting in the car, happens to spot the badge of another agent talking with Curtis and opens fire. Curtis is wounded and Scott has to kill Asani.\n\nAs the team prepares an assault in Dubai, a news broadcast reports that Laura and her college professor were discovered drowned while sailing off the coast of [[Martha's Vineyard]]. The rescue operation is called off. Scott returns home, convinced there is no more to be done, but Curtis tracks him down and insists that Laura is alive. He shows Scott an earring that was caught in his sniper's mat from the beach house identical to the earrings Laura is wearing in a news photograph.\n\nWhen they return to the beach house to investigate, Curtis is killed by a sniper positioned on a nearby boat. Scott evades the sniper and when he finds Laura's unique sign on a window in the beach house indicating she was there, he realizes that she may not be dead. He takes his pager and phone apart and finds a tracking device.\n\nHe tries to contact Laura's mother, who is touring a rehab facility, but he is intercepted by a female [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent assigned to guard the [[First Family of the United States|First Family]]. When he shows the agent the earring, the agent, who knows Laura well, explains that for years the President has used visits to his daughter as a cover for extramarital affairs, and that he pulled Laura's Secret Service detail to use as extra protection for himself during the latest trip, leaving her vulnerable to the members of the sex trafficking ring.\n\nScott enlists Sergeant Black to help him rescue the girl from Dubai and turns to Avi, a former Israeli operative. Avi agrees to get him into Dubai and smuggle Laura out concealed in a cargo container at the airport, obtaining weapons for him and support from a local man known as Jones.\n\nJones is killed during the rescue and Scott flees with Laura to a safe house, where he persuades her that although he is alone, he is acting under orders. Correctly guessing that he is really acting on his own, Laura says that King [[Leonidas I|Leonidas]] of [[Sparta]] would respond to requests for help from neighboring kingdoms by sending one man, and decides to trust him.\n\nWhen he takes Laura to the airport to seal her in the cargo container, Scott discovers he is being tracked when he finds a transmitter hidden in his knife. He rushes her out of the container just as his old team arrives to apprehend them. Scott is shot and Laura is captured. Her captor reveals herself as Sgt. Black, who shows her the earring and photos from the Secret Service agent, convincing Laura to stop struggling. A Swedish news crew witnesses the struggle as they are about to board their own plane nearby, and recognize Laura. Black is shot, and a hysterical Laura is hustled to safety aboard the journalists' plane. Scott finds the injured Black, who asks if Laura is now safe, which Scott confirms.\n\nLater, on a London city street, a stubbled Scott is shown watching an evening news broadcast regarding Laura's return on a television in a shop window. The government spins the story of Laura's kidnapping as an opportunity for the President to take action to end the trafficking of American girls as sex slaves. A British man watching alongside Scott says, \"Time to go home,\" and walks away. Scott watches him leave and says, \"Lucky man.\" Scott is then seen walking off into [[Piccadilly Circus]].\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Val Kilmer]] as Master Gunnery  Sergeant John / Bobby Scott\n* [[Derek Luke]] as Curtis\n* [[Tia Texada]] as Sergeant Jacqueline Black\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as First Daughter Laura Newton\n* [[Lionel Mark Smith]] as Colonel Blane\n* [[Johnny Messner (actor)|Johnny Messner]] as Sergeant Grace\n* [[Ed O'Neill]] as Robert Burch\n* [[William H.

The only thing that raises it to the level of 'interesting [[popular culture|pop culture]] artifact' is the sheer strangeness of its central conceit, which is almost bizarre enough to merit the price of the [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster]] rental. I won't spoil it\u2014but suffice to say, David Mamet thinks [[Jenna Bush Hager|Jenna]] and [[Barbara Bush (born 1981)|Barbara]] should be keeping a weather eye on their [[George W.
