Current count is 687 words. -->\nA few months after the events of the [[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|previous film]], the Radcliffe family and their 101 [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatians]] are preparing to move to their \"Dalmatian Plantation\", a home in the countryside with plenty of room for all of them. However, Patch, one of the puppies, feels ignored and wishes to be unique like his television hero, Thunderbolt. While watching ''The Thunderbolt Adventure Hour'', Patch hears about a chance to appear on the show. He is accidentally left behind when his family leaves for the plantation, so he decides to head for the audition to meet his hero and win a guest spot on the show, but fails to impress the producers.\n\nMeanwhile, Thunderbolt's \"trusty\" sidekick, Lil' Lightning, tells Thunderbolt the producers want to replace him with a younger dog. In order to save his job, Thunderbolt decides he will go into the real world and perform an act of true heroism to prove himself. A veritable reference book to Thunderbolt's many adventures, Patch provides the perfect guide for the television star in his attempts at real-life heroics. Elsewhere in [[London]], [[Cruella de Vil]], unable to purchase furs due to being on [[probation]] for her previous crimes, attempts to soothe her fixation on spots with the help of Lars, a French [[beatnik]] artist. In order to inspire him, she restarts her hunt for the Dalmatians, using a newspaper picture of Patch to find their new address.\n\nPatch's family finally becomes aware that he is missing and go back to London to find him. Cruella bails her former henchmen, brothers Jasper and Horace Baddun, out of prison. She sends them in a stolen [[dog food]] truck to steal the remaining puppies. They succeed after dealing with Nanny, and they take them to Lars. When Cruella requests she be made a masterpiece from their fur, Lars angrily refuses, not wanting them to be harmed. Enraged, she has him bound and gagged and returns to her original plan of making a Dalmatian [[fur coat]].\n\nThe imprisoned puppies use the ''Twilight Bark'' to send a distress signal, which is picked up by Patch and Thunderbolt, and they set out to save Patch's family. Lightning is horrified when he discovers Thunderbolt might actually become a hero and hurries to the warehouse where the puppies are being held. He convinces Thunderbolt not to use Patch's stealth plan, but to openly attack. Cruella appears, knocks Thunderbolt out, and locks Patch and Thunderbolt in a cage. Lightning sneaks in and reveals to Patch that Thunderbolt is just an actor (or a \"fraud\" in his own words), betrays the duo and leaves them locked up. Patch is deeply hurt that Thunderbolt would lie, but soon realizes that their current situation was covered in one of ''The Thunderbolt Adventure Hour'' episodes, and manages to escape. Patch releases his family, but Thunderbolt stays in his open cage. Patch manages to trick Cruella and the Baddun brothers into going downstairs, while the puppies escape through the building's roof. Meanwhile, Thunderbolt escapes from his cage and frees Lars.\n\nThe puppies board a [[double-decker bus]], but Cruella and the Baddun brothers discover the escape and pursue them in their stolen [[Chevrolet Eagle|truck]], racing through the streets of London, and crashing through the filming of Lightning's new show. Cruella and the Baddun brothers finally corner the puppies in an alley. Patch tries to hold them off while the others escape, but they are undaunted. Luckily, Thunderbolt arrives, having been driven to the scene by Lars, and fakes a heart attack, distracting Cruella and causing her to knock out Jasper and Horace and incapacitate herself. Patch puts the bus into reverse, sending Cruella, the Baddun brothers, and Lightning scrambling into the [[River Thames]], along with their stolen truck. Patch and Thunderbolt survey the scene, both letting out deep, heroic barks. The police arrest Lightning with two [[English mastiff]]s. Cruella is also arrested and, now driven completely insane, is sent to a mental institution, while Jasper and Horace confessed their actions to the Radcliffe family that Cruella was the one behind the kidnappings, the charges were dropped, pardoned, reformed and started their own shop of sundresses. Pongo, Perdita, The Radcliffes, and Nanny arrive, and Patch's parents tell him they are proud of him. Thunderbolt dismisses himself as just an actor, but says that Patch is \"a real, one of a kind wonder-dog\".\n\nAfter a newspaper montage reveals the fates of the characters, a [[post-credits scene]] shows Thunderbolt in his television show with Patch as his new sidekick and the other puppies as [[extra (actor)|extras]], chasing the villain away into the sunset.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n* [[Bobby Lockwood]] as Patch, one of the 101 Dalmatian puppies. He has a large black spot over one of his eyes, hence his name. He feels lonely and left-out oftentimes with his family, thinking that he is just one of the famous 101 Dalmatians, and longs for a chance to become separate and leave the shadow of his brothers and sisters. He is adventurous, bold, and strong-minded. He quickly befriends Thunderbolt, the famous television wonder-dog whom he adores, and later meets Lil' Lightning, the famous sidekick of Thunderbolt (only to be betrayed by him later on).\n* [[Barry Bostwick]] as Thunderbolt, a [[German Shepherd]] and the star of ''The Thunderbolt Adventure Hour''. As the film opens, it is shown that Thunderbolt is not exactly bright, and very self-centered and rude to his sidekick, Lil' Lightning, which eventually provokes the Corgi to revolt. When Thunderbolt runs away, after being tricked by Lightning in thinking that the director of his famous show plans to kill him off, he runs into Patch, and the two quickly bond, trying to do heroic feats to prove that Thunderbolt is a real hero. As the film progresses, Thunderbolt becomes a fatherlike figure to Patch, and loses his starry-eyed, naive ways to become a strong, brave, and faithful dog.\n* [[Susanne Blakeslee]] as [[Cruella de Vil]], the villain of the original film, back again to kidnap the puppies. She is now under a restraining order due to her past history of crimes of trying to kidnap and kill the Dalmatian puppies. To help cure her obsession for fur, she meets Lars and has him do a Dalmatian masterpiece for her, but he refuses once she reveals she wants him to use the puppies' coats as canvases. This makes her revolt and go back to her original plan of kidnapping the dogs for a coat. In the end, she is defeated and sent to a psychiatric hospital.\n* [[Jason Alexander]] as Lil' Lightning, a [[Pembroke Welsh Corgi]] and the sidekick of Thunderbolt's famous show. Initially, Thunderbolt considers Lightning his best friend, despite being rude to him and pushing him aside. Eventually, Lightning becomes angry at always crawling in Thunderbolt's shadow and putting up with his arrogance and rejection of him. To retaliate, Lightning tricks Thunderbolt into running away, then plots to manipulate the director into re-writing the show slanted towards Lightning. When Thunderbolt and Patch return, endangering Lightning's chance at fame, he reveals himself to be the traitor he is and has the two dogs locked away. In the end, however, he briefly shows remorse when Thunderbolt fakes his death, but is then taken away to the dog pound by two [[police dog]]s.\n* [[Martin Short]] as Lars, a stylish, but eccentric, French artist who enjoys little more than painting spots. It is suggested he had some romantic feelings towards Cruella, but when she captures the Dalmatian puppies again and plans to break her rules of goodness and make coats out of them, he realizes her true colors and rebels, only to be bound and gagged by Cruella herself. In the end, he is freed by Thunderbolt and sends him to defend Patch from Cruella, Jasper, and Horace.\n* [[Samuel West]] as Pongo, father (and adopted father) of the 99 Dalmatian puppies. He is loving but distracted, something here that forces Patch to feel lonely and just one-hundred and one, instead of standing out. In the workprint, [[Kevin Schon]] reprises his role as Pongo from the series.\n* [[Kath Soucie]] as Perdita, mother (and adopted mother) of the 99 Dalmatian puppies. She is a gentle, loving soul who only wants the best for her children (and adopted children), and is horrified to find her children missing once again. In the workprint, [[Pam Dawber]] reprises her role as Perdita from the series.\n* [[Tim Bentinck]] as Roger Radcliffe, Pongo's original owner. In the workprint, [[Jeff Bennett]] reprises his role as Roger from the series.\n* [[Jodi Benson]] as Anita Radcliffe, Perdita's original owner.\n* [[Jeff Bennett]] and [[Maurice LaMarche]] as Jasper and Horace Baddun, Cruella's bumbling henchmen. They are in jail when the film starts, but are bailed out by Cruella, who rehires them to finish the job of killing and skinning the Dalmatian puppies, though they doubt her as they do not want to be made fools of again. She later has them capture the puppies in cages and bring them to Lars so he can use them as canvases for a masterpiece. In the end, Jasper and Horace are arrested again. Surprisingly, however, they part ways with Cruella after this second arrest, opening a shop in London instead of continuing their past occupation as incompetent criminals.\n* [[Mary MacLeod (actress)|Mary MacLeod]] as Nanny, the Radcliffe family's maid, who confronts the Baduns (again) when they attempt to steal the puppies a second time.\n* Ben Tibber as Lucky, one of Patch's brothers.\n* Eli Russel Linnetz as Rolly, one of Patch's brothers, a chubby food lover.\n* [[Kasha Kropinski]] as Penny, one of Patch's sisters.\n* [[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]] as Producer\n* [[Jim Cummings]] as Dirty Dawson, the villain of ''The Thunderbolt Adventure Hour''.\n** Cummings also voices the Colonel, an Old English Sheepdog and a friend of the Dalmatian family. He is cut from the final cut of the movie, but is seen in the workprint, where he moves into the Dalmatian Plantation and assists in the film's final battle.\n* [[Michael Gough (voice actor)|Michael Gough]] as Sergeant Tibbs, a farm cat and a friend to the Dalmatian family. He is cut from the final cut of the movie, but is seen in the workprint, where he moves into the Dalmatian Plantation and assists in the film's final battle.\n* [[Frank Welker]] as the Captain, a horse and a friend to the Dalmatian family.
