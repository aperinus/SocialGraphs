On Christmas, they chase two muggers into a subway tunnel. Nearby trains are halted, but transit captain Donald Patterson allows the [[money train]] \u2013 hauling subway revenue \u2013 to continue. One of the teenage muggers is gunned down and killed by transit cops guarding the money train, triggering a brawl between them and the brothers. Patterson blames John and Charlie for delaying the money train.\n\nCharlie asks John for money to buy a Christmas present, but instead uses it to pay off gambling debts to mobster Mr. Brown, only to get even more into debt when Brown intends to have his men throw Charlie off a building, until  John intervenes. Revealing Charlie is $15,000 in debt, John at first decides to let them drop him,  yet after a brief conversation Mr. Brown accepts John\u2019s promise to deliver the money in a few days.\n\nJohn and Charlie both take a liking to Grace Santiago, a newly assigned decoy transit officer. When a serial killer known as the Torch robs a token booth and sets it on fire at risk of killing the booth attendant, John and Charlie rescue the attendant and put out the fire, but Torch escapes and knocks out Grace.\n\nJohn rejects Charlie\u2019s plan to rob the money train to pay off the debt. When they and Grace are assigned to patrol the money train, Charlie discovers a grate in the train\u2019s floor and a maintenance ladder leading to Central Park. A brawl breaks out between John and another officer, quickly involving the entire squad. Again blaming the brothers and accusing them of taking some of the money, Patterson continues to berate them even after realizing a collection agent miscounted. Charlie tells John the best time to rob the money train would be New Year's Eve, due to looser security and the year\u2019s highest proceeds: up to $4,000,000 that night.\n\nJohn gives Charlie $15,000 to pay back Mr. Brown, but while on the train, Charlie loses it to an old lady and is beaten by Brown\u2019s men as punishment. John is visited by Grace, having both realized their mutual attraction to each other and the two make love. Returning home, stopping by John\u2019s apartment, he is saddened to spot Grace and John sleeping together and walks away, with John feeling remorse for hurting Charlie (as well as disappointment after Charlie tells him he lost the money).\n\nIn a [[sting operation]] to apprehend Torch, Grace is disguised as a token booth attendant. Realizing the trap, Torch distracts police by pushing a man in front of a moving train, killing him. Torch sprays gasoline on Grace, but before he can light it, Charlie alerts the other officers, who open fire. John pursues the killer into another station, where they fight. Torch is burned by his gasoline and killed by an approaching train. Patterson fires Charlie for ruining the ambush; trying to defend Charlie, John is fired as well, leading to the brothers having a major falling out.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, John storms into Mr. Brown\u2019s [[Strip club|strip club]], after hearing about Charlie and defeats the mobsters using his martial arts skills, threatening Brown if anything happens to Charlie, knocking him out with a [[360 Crescent kick|360-degree kick]] into a glass enclosure.\n\nGrace persuades John to intervene in Charlie\u2019s robbery. Charlie enters the money train from beneath, throws out the driver and drives it to the ladder, but is unable to escape with the money due to the presence of a group of [[New York City Police Department Mounted Unit|NYPD Mounted cops]]. Reaching the train, John persuades Charlie to drive further to avoid arrest, and they disable the brakes to prevent Patterson activating them remotely. Patterson deploys a steel barricade, but John and Charlie accidentally increase the train to maximum speed and smashes through the barricade. Transit control officer Kowalski declares the money train a runaway and starts clearing tracks, but Patterson diverts the train onto a track occupied by a passenger train, the 1220 Coney Island to prevent its riders' escape, and doesn't even tell the driver about the money train. When Charlie tries to steal the money, John attempts to stop him from doing so, leading to a brawl between the brothers. Eventually, the two stop fighting when Charlie saves John from falling off the train. The money train slams into the rear of the 1220 and slows down, but speeds up again, continuing to ram it with the increasing risk of derailing it and killing everyone on board, including the driver.\n\nWith no brakes and the throttle jammed, the brothers decide to throw the train into reverse to save the passenger train. Charlie positions an iron bar to trip the reverse lever, and the brothers climb on top of the train. The money train rams into 1220 again, activating the reverse lever, putting it into reverse position and the brothers jump across to the 1220 train as the money train derails, to the horror of Patterson, who is waiting at the next station with the officers.\n\nWhen arriving, the brothers try to escape but are spotted by Patterson, who interrogates them. Fed up with his abuse, they both punch him in the face after he spits at John. As Patterson shouts out for their arrest, he is arrested himself by Grace for endangering the passengers\u2019 lives, much to the brothers amazement. The brothers then exit onto Times Square just as the New Year countdown begins and ends, ringing in [[1996]]. During the celebration, John realizes Charlie has a bag with over $500,000, much to his dismay. The film closes with the brothers walking off into the distance arguing over the money while the credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as Officer John Robinson\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as Officer Charlie Robinson\n* [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Officer Grace Santiago\n* [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] as Captain Donald Patterson\n* [[Chris Cooper]] as Terry \"The Torch\" Edwards\n* [[Joe Grifasi]] as Riley\n* [[Scott Sowers]] as Mr. Brown\n* [[Skipp Sudduth]] as Kowalski\n* [[Enrico Colantoni]] as Dooley\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:NYCS fake money train.jpg|thumb|A former [[R21 (New York City Subway car)|R21]] car was rebuilt for use in the film.

After production, the car was donated to the [[New York Transit Museum]], and is currently stored at the Coney Island Complex as of February 2010. Other cars were used as props in the movie.<ref name=\"NYCsubway.org\" />\n\nFour additional R30s were used for filming on New York City Subway property, including for the crash between the money train and the 1220 Coney Island. These four cars were 8463, 8510, 8558, and 8569.<ref name=\"NYCsubway.org\" />\n\nThe actual [[money train]] resembled a normal maintenance train painted yellow with black diagonal stripes. The New York City subway system retired its money trains in 2006, as the introduction of the [[MetroCard]] and computerized vending machines that allowed fare payment by credit card have dramatically reduced the number of coins stored in subway stations. Two money train cars were later sent to the New York Transit Museum.\n\n==Music==\nThe original music score by [[Mark Mancina]] was released in March 2011 by La-La Land Records as a limited edition of 3000 copies. The album features approximately 41 minutes of music across 17 tracks.
