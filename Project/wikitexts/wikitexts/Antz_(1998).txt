The film received positive reviews, with critics praising the voice cast, animation, humor, and its appeal towards adults.<ref name=rt />\n\n==Plot==\nZ is an anxious worker ant who chafes at conformity and the fact that everyone, even his [[psychiatrist]], reminds him he is insignificant. While at the local bar one night, Z falls in love with Princess Bala when she visits the bar to escape her suffocating royal life.\n\nThe ant colony declares war on an encroaching [[termite]] colony, and soldiers are sent to engage the invaders. To see Bala again, Z exchanges places with his soldier friend, Weaver, and joins the army, where he befriends staff sergeant Barbatus. The ants are unaware that General Mandible, the army's leader and Bala's fiancee, is secretly sending the soldiers loyal to the Queen to die so he can stage a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]]. In the battle, everyone except Z is killed by much-larger [[Fontanellar gun|acid-shooting]] termite defenders. Before dying, Barbatus tells Z to think for himself instead of blindly following orders. Meanwhile, Weaver joins the digging crew and falls in love with Z's co-worker, Azteca.\n\nZ returns home and is mistakenly hailed as a war hero. Secretly unsatisfied, Mandible congratulates him and introduces him to the Queen. There, Z meets Bala, who recognizes him as a worker. Z panics and pretends to take Bala hostage, causing him and Bala to fall out of the anthill via a garbage chute. Now a fugitive, Z decides to search for Insectopia, a legendary insect paradise. Bala attempts to return to the colony, but quickly rejoins Z after encountering a [[Mantis|praying mantis]].\n\nZ's act of individuality inspires the workers and some soldier ants, halting productivity. To gain control, Mandible publicly portrays Z as a self-centered war criminal, promotes the glory of conformity and promises the workers rewards for completing a \"Mega Tunnel\" he designed. However, Mandible's second-in-command, a [[nuptial flight|flying ant]] named Cutter, begins to doubt Mandible's constant reassurances that he's acting \"for the good of the colony\".\n\nZ and Bala come upon a human picnic, which they mistake for Insectopia. They are baffled by the wrappings on the food, but Muffy and Chip, a married couple of [[liberalism|liberal]] [[paper wasp|wasps]], condescendingly befriend them and try to help break the wrappers. They are disrupted by the humans, who kill Muffy with a [[fly swatter]] and attempt to squish them with a shoe. Z rescues Bala from the sneaker, and the two ants at last find Insectopia, a trash can overfilled with decaying food. Bala begins to reciprocate Z's feelings.\n\nAfter interrogating Weaver, Mandible learns that Z is looking for Insectopia and sends Cutter to find it. That night, Cutter arrives at Insectopia and forcibly flies Bala back to the colony while Z is away. Seeing Z's desperation at finding Bala gone, a drunken Chip, mourning over Muffy's death, generously flies him back to the colony.\n\nWhen Z arrives, he encounters soldiers who forcibly direct him toward the Mega Tunnel. Along the way, he finds Bala held captive in Mandible's office. After he frees her, they both discover that Mandible's Mega Tunnel leads straight to the puddle next to Insectopia, which Mandible will use to drown the Queen Ant and the workers at the opening ceremony. Bala warns the Queen while Z attempts to stop the workers in time, but fails. Z and Bala unify the Queen and workers into building a ladder of themselves towards the surface as the water rises.\n\nMeanwhile, Mandible gathers the soldiers on the surface and gloats he has created a new colony, where only the strong survive. When the worker ants break through the surface, Cutter betrays Mandible and rescues the worker ants \"for the good of the colony\". Enraged, Mandible attempts to tackle Cutter, but Z intervenes and takes the blow. He and Mandible fall back into the flooded tunnel, with Mandible striking a root and dying on impact. Z is nearly drowned, but is rescued by Cutter and [[CPR|resuscitated]] by Bala.\n\nZ is praised for his heroism, and he and Bala become a couple. Together, they rebuild the colony, and Z narrates that he is finally content with his place in the world. The camera then zooms out to show the anthill is in [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]].\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD \"OTHER FILMS\" TO THIS SECTION.-->\n{{div col|colwidth=26em}}\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Z Marion-4195 \"Z\", an [[Idealism|idealistic]], but [[Generalized anxiety disorder|anxious]], worker ant.\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as General Mandible, the sarcastic, unscrupulous and arrogant [[general officer]] of the ant military.\n* [[Sharon Stone]] as Princess Bala, the Queen Ant's daughter, Mandible's fianc\u00e9e, and Z's love interest.\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as Corporal Weaver, a brave soldier ant and Z's best friend who becomes Azteca's boyfriend.\n* [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Azteca, another friend of Z's and a worker ant who becomes Weaver's girlfriend.\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Colonel Cutter, a [[Nuptial flight|flying ant]] that serves as Mandible's patient and [[Empathy|empathetic]] adviser who becomes disillusioned by the general's actions.\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Staff Sergeant Barbatus, a soldier ant who befriends Z during the fight against the termites.\n* [[Anne Bancroft]] as the Queen Ant, Princess Bala's mother and ruler of the ants.\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Chip, a wasp whom Z befriends.\n* [[Grant Shaud]] as the Foreman, the head of the worker ants.\n* [[John Mahoney]] as Grebs, a drunk ant scout who talked about Insectopia.\n* [[Jane Curtin]] as Muffin \"Muffy\" the Wasp, Chip's wife.\n* [[Paul Mazursky]] as Z's Psychiatrist.\n* Jerry Sroka as the Bartender, the unnamed bartender of the bar that Z and Weaver frequent.\n* [[Jim Cummings]] and [[April Winchell]] as additional voices\n{{div col end}}\nThe cast features several actors from movies Allen wrote, starred in and directed, including Stone (''[[Stardust Memories]]''), Stallone (''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]''), Hackman (''[[Another Woman (1988 film)|Another Woman]]''), and Walken (''[[Annie Hall]]'').

Lasseter and Jobs believed that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg.<ref name=\"Isaacson307\" /><ref name=BWAntzVsBugs /> Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split, often calling to check up. In October 1995, when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on ''Toy Story'' at the [[Universal Studios]] lot, where DreamWorks was also located, Lasseter and [[Andrew Stanton]] visited Katzenberg and they discussed their plans for ''Bugs'' in detail.<ref name=\"Isaacson307\" /><ref name=\"PixarTouch08\">Price, p. 169</ref> Lasseter had high hopes for ''Toy Story'', and he was telling friends throughout the tight-knit computer-animation business to get cracking on their own films. \"If this hits, it's going to be like space movies after ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''\" for computer-animation studios, he told various friends.<ref name=BWAntzVsBugs /> \"I should have been wary,\" Lasseter later recalled. \"Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it would be released.\"<ref name=\"Isaacson307\" />\n\nWhen the trades indicated production on ''Antz'', Lasseter, feeling betrayed, called Katzenberg and asked him bluntly if it were true, Katzenberg confirming it.<ref name=BWAntzVsBugs /> Katzenberg recalled ''Antz'' came from a 1991 story pitch by [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim Johnson]] that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994.<ref name=BWAntzVsBugs /> Another source gives [[Nina Jacobson]], one of Katzenberg's executives, as the person responsible for the ''Antz'' pitch.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\" /> Lasseter refused to believe Katzenberg's story.<ref name=\"Isaacson308\">{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|title=[[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]]|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|year=2011|page=[https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/308 308]|isbn=978-1-4516-4853-9}}</ref> Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg was under the impression that Disney was \"out to get him\" and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenberg's fight with Disney.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\" /><ref name=BWAntzVsBugs /> Eisner had decided not to pay Katzenberg his contract-required bonus, convincing Disney's board not to give him anything.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\" /> Lasseter grimly relayed the news of ''Antz'' to Pixar employees but kept morale high. Privately, Lasseter told other executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\" />\n\n=== Competition with Disney ===\nAt the time, the current Disney studio executives were starting a bitter competitive rivalry with Jeffrey Katzenberg and his new DreamWorks films. In 1995, Katzenberg announced ''The Prince of Egypt'' to debut in November 1998 as DreamWorks' first animated release.<ref name=BWAntzVsBugs /> A year later, Disney scheduled ''Bugs'' to open on the same weekend, which infuriated Katzenberg. Katzenberg invited Disney executives to DreamWorks to negotiate a release date change for ''Bugs'', but the company refused to budge. DreamWorks pushed ''Prince of Egypt'' to the Christmas season and the studio had decided not to begin full marketing for ''Antz'' until after ''Prince of Egypt'' was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aintitcool.com/node/704|title=Tons of ANIMATION news!!! |publisher=[[Ain't it Cool News]] |access-date=September 3, 2016}}</ref> Disney afterward announced release dates for films that were going to compete with ''The Prince of Egypt'', and both studios had to compete with [[Paramount Pictures]], which was releasing ''[[The Rugrats Movie]]'' in November, based on [[Nickelodeon]]'s animated series ''[[Rugrats]]''.

Regardless, Lasseter publicly dismissed ''Antz'' as a \"schlock version\" of ''A Bug's Life'';<ref name=\"PixarTouch12\">Price, p. 173</ref> however, Lasseter later admitted that he never saw the film. Lasseter claimed that if DreamWorks and PDI had made the film about anything other than insects, he would have closed Pixar for the day so the entire company could go see it.<ref name=BWAntzVsBugs /><ref name=\"PixarTouch13\">Price, p. 174</ref> Jobs and Katzenberg would not back down and the rivaling ant films provoked a press frenzy. \"The bad guys rarely win,\" Jobs told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. In response, DreamWorks\u2019 head of marketing Terry Press suggested, \"Steve Jobs should take a pill.\"<ref name=\"Isaacson308\" /> Tensions would remain high between Jobs and Katzenberg for many years after the release of both films. According to Jobs, years later, Katzenberg approached him after the opening of ''[[Shrek]]'', and insisted that he had never heard the pitch for ''A Bug's Life'', reasoning that his settlement with Disney would have given him a share of the profits if that were so.<ref name=\"Isaacson309\">{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|title=[[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]]|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|year=2011|page=[https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/309 309]|isbn=978-1-4516-4853-9}}</ref> In the end, Pixar and PDI employees kept up the old friendships that had arisen from working in computer animation for years before feature films.<ref name=\"PixarTouch11\" />\n\nThe final product of both films are generally perceived to contrast one another in tone and certain plot points. ''Antz'' in the end seemed to be more geared towards older audiences, featuring moderate violence, mild sexual innuendoes, and profanity, as well as social and political satire. ''A Bug's Life'' was more family-friendly and lighthearted in tone and story. The two films especially differ in their artistic look: ''Antz'' played off more realistic aspects of ants and how they relate to other bugs, like termites and wasps, while ''A Bug's Life'' offered a more fanciful look at insects to better suit its story. ''[[PopMatters]]'' journalist J.C. Ma\u00e7ek III compared the two films and wrote, \"The feud deepened with both teams making accusations and excuses and a release date war ensued. While ''Antz'' beat ''A Bug's Life'' to the big screen by two months, the latter film significantly out grossed its predecessor.
