The film also stars [[Michael Jai White]] (briefly appeared in the first film as a soldier), [[Heidi Schanz]], [[Xander Berkeley]], [[Justin Lazard]], [[Kiana Tom]], [[Daniel von Bargen]], [[James R. Black]], Karis Paige Bryant and [[Bill Goldberg]]. The film was theatrically released in the United States on August 20, 1999. This was Van Damme's last [[Wide release|widely released]] film in the United States [[The Expendables 2|until 2012]].\n\nIt is a direct sequel to the 1992 film ''[[Universal Soldier (1992 film)|Universal Soldier]]'' and the fourth film in the [[Universal Soldier (film series)|''Universal Soldier'' film series]], preceded by two made-for-TV movies, ''[[Universal Soldier II: Brothers in Arms]]'' and ''[[Universal Soldier III: Unfinished Business]]'', which this film ignores, thereby presenting an alternate continuity.<ref name=\"latimes\" /> The film was received with negative reviews and grossed over $10 million in theaters in the United States. The fifth installment in the series, a [[direct-to-video]] film ''[[Universal Soldier: Regeneration]]'', was released in 2009, ten years after the film's release, ignoring the events of ''The Return'' and being an alternative sequel to the first film.\n\n==Plot==\nAt least 15 years after Andrew Scott's death,{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Universal Soldier (1992 film)|Universal Soldier]]'' (1992).}} former UniSol [[Luc Deveraux]] ([[Jean-Claude Van Damme]]) has been reverted to normal via genetic procedures. He currently works as a technical expert for the U.S. government with his new partner Maggie ([[Kiana Tom]]), who has been through countless hours of combat training with him. They worked to refine and perfect the UniSol Program in an effort to make a new, stronger breed of soldiers that are more sophisticated and intelligent to reduce the use of normal, human soldiers in the battlefield. All of the new UniSols, known as ''UniSols 2500'', which are faster and stronger than the original UniSols, are connected via neural implants through a sentient [[artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] computer system called S.E.T.H. (Self-Evolving Thought Helix).\n\nWhen S.E.T.H. discovers that the UniSol Program is scheduled to be shut down because of budget cuts, he finds this to be a disgrace and decides to take action by formulating a plot to overthrow mankind and take over the world with his own massive army of UniSols. The next day, S.E.T.H. unleashes a platoon of UniSols, led by the musclebound Romeo ([[Bill Goldberg]]), in a hostile takeover of the UniSol building, resulting in the deaths of many occupants, including Dr. Dylan Cotner ([[Xander Berkeley]]), who was responsible for reverting Luc back to normal. As such, Luc, Maggie, and the others are forced to evacuate. With the help of a rogue cyberpunk named Squid (Brent Hinkley), S.E.T.H. is able to put himself into a UniSol body ([[Michael Jai White]]) superior to the others. In the meantime, Maggie noticed that Luc's daughter Hillary Deveraux (Karis Paige Bryant) has suffered brain swelling after almost being attacked by Romeo, and Maggie takes her to the local hospital.\n\nLuc attempts to find a way to shut down S.E.T.H. with help from ambitious reporter Erin Young ([[Heidi Schanz]]), whose cameraman died in the massacre. General Radford ([[Daniel von Bargen]]) wants to take extreme measures to stop S.E.T.H. by sending in troops, but most of the troops (alongside a TV reporter and her crew) were massacred by four UniSols; even when Luc briefly tried to lead a team of [[United States Army Rangers]] commanded by Captain Blackburn ([[Justin Lazard]]) and Sergeant Morrow ([[James R. Black]]), most of the Rangers (including Blackburn and Morrow) are killed when a UniSol sentry sees them sneaking into the building.\n\nLuc and Erin then track down Squid after learning that he was a former member of the UniSol Program, but S.E.T.H. arrives and kills Squid, revealing an ultimatum to Luc: he must give up the secret code that is needed to deactivate a built-in program that will shut S.E.T.H. down in a matter of hours so that no one will stop him. To ensure that Luc will cooperate, a departing S.E.T.H.\u00a0got Romeo to track down Hillary at the hospital, and S.E.T.H. kidnaps Hillary while Romeo kills Maggie and several hospital guards. Upon returning to the UniSol building, S.E.T.H. deactivated a time bomb implanted by Radford to prevent the UniSol building from being destroyed, much to Radford's outrage.\n\nHaving no other choice, Luc returns to the UniSol building again and takes down many UniSols, right before learning that Maggie has been revived as a UniSol. He also learns that S.E.T.H. is healing Hillary with UniSol technology, and upon deciphering code, S.E.T.H. decides to kill Luc and raise Hillary as his own daughter. Eventually, Luc destroys S.E.T.H. by shattering his body to pieces with liquid nitrogen, but the remaining UniSols are still active; even Romeo catches and defeats Luc in combat, intending to kill him and Hillary and lead the remaining UniSols into battle. However, Maggie (who has been freed due to S.E.T.H.'s demise) shoots Romeo and allows Luc and Hillary to leave, asking Luc to blow up the building with herself, Romeo and the remaining UniSols inside as she refuses to live the rest of her life as a UniSol. Luc reluctantly obliged Maggie's wishes by setting off the time bomb to destroy the building, killing the remaining UniSols for good. Luc then reunites with Erin and Hillary, satisfied that they have put an end to S.E.T.H.'s plot and avenged their loved ones.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] as [[Luc Deveraux|Private Luc Deveraux]]\n* [[Michael Jai White]] as S.E.T.H.
