The film stars [[Dev Patel]], Sunny Pawar, [[Rooney Mara]], [[David Wenham]], and [[Nicole Kidman]], as well as Abhishek Bharate, [[Divian Ladwa]], [[Priyanka Bose]], [[Deepti Naval]], [[Tannishtha Chatterjee]], and [[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]]. It tells the true story of how Brierley, 25 years after being separated from his family in [[India]], sets out to find them. It is a joint production between Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe film, which had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on 10 September 2016, was given a [[limited release]] in North America on 25 November 2016, by [[The Weinstein Company]] before opening generally on 6 January 2017. It was released in Australia on 19 January 2017 and in the United Kingdom on 20 January 2017.\n\n''Lion'' was well-received by critics, with praise for the acting (particularly from Patel and Kidman), emotional weight, visuals, cinematography and screenplay; it received six [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations at the [[89th Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (Patel), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (Kidman), and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. It won two [[BAFTA Awards]] for [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role|Best Supporting Actor]] (Patel) and [[BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. The film was also commercially successful, making $140 million worldwide, becoming one of the [[Cinema of Australia#Highest-grossing Australian films|highest-grossing Australian films]] of all time.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1986, Saroo, a five-year-old boy, lives with his elder brother Guddu, his mother and his younger baby sister in [[Khandwa]], [[India]]. Guddu and Saroo steal [[coal]] from freight [[trains]] to trade for [[milk]] and [[food]]. One night Saroo pesters his brother who is going to work overnight to let him come too. Guddu refuses at first yet finally relents, and they arrive at a nearby train station where Saroo is too tired to stay awake. Guddu places Saroo on a bench and tells him to wait for his return. Saroo promptly falls asleep and when he wakes up Guddu is not there. Saroo searches the station for Guddu and gets on an empty train looking for him. There he falls asleep again in one of the compartments, only to awake sometime later to find the train in motion and the doors locked. After several days the train arrives in faraway [[Calcutta]] where 5-year-old Saroo does not understand the local [[Bengali language]]. He stands at a ticket counter and tries to obtain a ticket home, but the attendant does not recognise the name of his village, which Saroo says is \"Ganestalay\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2015-04-24/maphead-ken-jennings-saroo-brierley-google-earth-a-long-way-home |title=How Google Maps Helped One Man Find His Long-Lost Family |last=Jennings |first=Ken |date=27 April 2015 |website=Conde Nast Traveler|publisher=Conde Nast]|access-date=11 January 2017}}</ref> He spends the night in the station with some street children, but is then woken up and forced to run when a group of men try to kidnap them.\n\nSaroo continues to wander around the city before coming across Noor, a seemingly friendly woman who takes him back to her apartment. She tells Saroo that a man named Rama will help him find his way home. Saroo runs away, sensing that Noor and Rama have sinister intentions, and escapes Noor when she chases after him. After two months of living near the [[Howrah Bridge]], Saroo is taken to the police by a young man. Unable to trace his family, they put him in an [[orphanage]]. Three months later, Saroo is introduced to Mrs Sood, who tells him she has placed an advertisement about him in several local newspapers, but no one has responded. She then tells him that an Australian couple is interested in [[Adoption|adopting]] him. She begins to teach Saroo basic English and he moves to [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]] in 1987, under the care of Sue and John Brierley, where he slowly starts to settle into his new adopted lifestyle. One year later, they adopt another boy, Mantosh, who has trouble adjusting to his new home and suffers from rage and [[self-harm]].\n\nTwenty years later Saroo is now a young man who moves to [[Melbourne]] to study [[hotel management]]. He starts a relationship with Lucy, an American student. During a meal with some Indian friends at their home, he comes across [[jalebi]], a delicacy he remembers from his childhood. Saroo reveals that he is not from Calcutta and that he has been lost for more than twenty years, and his friends suggest he use [[Google Earth]] to search for his hometown in India. Saroo commences his search, but over time disconnects from Lucy and his family, overwhelmed by the thought of emotions his family must have gone through when he was missing.\n\nSaroo visits his adoptive mother, Sue, whose health is deteriorating, and learns that she is not infertile, but had chosen to help others in need through adoption, believing that there were already too many people on Earth. After reconciling with Lucy, Saroo spends a long time searching fruitlessly for his hometown. One evening, while scanning Google Earth he notices the rock formations where his mother worked and then finds the area where he lived: the Ganesh Talai neighbourhood of the [[Khandwa district]]. He finally tells his adoptive mother about his search and she fully supports his efforts.\n\nSaroo returns to his hometown and with the help of a local English speaker, has an emotional reunion with his biological mother and sister. He also learns the fate of his brother Guddu, who was hit and killed by an oncoming train the night of his separation. Saroo's mother never gave up hope nor moved away from the village as she believed that one day her missing son would return home. The film ends with captions about the real Saroo's return to India in February 2012. Photos of the real Australian family are shown, as well as footage of Saroo introducing Sue to his biological mother in India, who deeply appreciates Sue's care for her son. Saroo later learned that he had been mispronouncing his own name for all those years, which was actually Sheru, meaning \"[[Asiatic lion|lion]]\".\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Dev Patel]] as [[Saroo Brierley]]\n** Sunny Pawar as Young Saroo Brierley\n* [[Rooney Mara]] as Lucy, Saroo's girlfriend\n* [[David Wenham]] as John Brierley, Saroo's adoptive father\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Sue Brierley, Saroo's adoptive mother\n* Abhishek Bharate as Guddu Khan, Saroo's biological brother\n* [[Divian Ladwa]] as Mantosh Brierley, Saroo's adoptive brother\n** Keshav Jadhav as Young Mantosh \n* [[Priyanka Bose]] as Kamla Munshi, Saroo's biological mother\n* [[Deepti Naval]] as Saroj Sood, founder of the Indian Society for Sponsorship and Adoption (ISSA)\n* [[Tannishtha Chatterjee]] as Noor\n* [[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]] as Rama\n* [[Benjamin Rigby]] as Waiter\n* Menik Gooneratne as Swarmina\n* [[Riddhi Sen]] as Caf\u00e9 Man, responsible for bringing Saroo to the authorities\n* [[Kaushik Sen]] as Police Officer\n* Rita Boy as Amita, Saroo's friend at the orphanage\n* [[Pallavi Sharda]] as Prama, Saroo's college friend\n* [[Sachin Joab]] as Bharat, Saroo's college friend\n* Arka Das as Sami, Saroo's college friend\n* Emilie Cocquerel as Annika, Saroo's college friend\n* [[Todd Sampson]] as a professor\n\n== Production ==\n\nThis Australian film<ref>{{cite news |last=Buckmaster |first=Luke |date=24 February 2017 |title=Oscars 2017: Tanna and Lion bring heart to Hollywood in landmark year for Australian film |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/24/oscars-2017-tanna-and-lion-bring-heart-to-hollywood-in-landmark-year-for-australian-film | work=The Guardian |location=London, UK |access-date=26 February 2017 |quote=two Australian films have been nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards: Lion and Hacksaw Ridge.}}</ref> is based on [[Saroo Brierley]]'s memoir ''A Long Way Home''.\n\nWhile writing the screenplay, Luke Davies acknowledged the challenges of adapting a book that is primarily about an online search:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"It was finding the right balance of the big cinema \"no-no\", which is that screens on screens is not good.
