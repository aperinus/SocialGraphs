It was considered one of the most dangerous postings in the U.S. Military.\"\n\nThe film chronicles the lives of the men from their deployment to the time of their return home, and begins with video footage of PFC Restrepo on a train one week prior. The goal of the deployment was to clear the Korengal Valley of insurgency and gain the trust of the local populace. The Korengal flows north to the [[Pech (river)|Pech]], which then flows east to the [[Kunar River]] valley on the porous border with [[Pakistan]]. As an example of the ever-present dangers, the first scenes cover a [[Shootout|fire-fight]] after a [[Humvee|military Hummer]] is disabled on a narrow mountain road by an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]].\n\nThe soldiers are ferried in by [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|Chinook]] and begin their deployment at [[Outpost (military)|Combat Outpost (COP)]] Korengal, and early in the campaign [[Private first class|PFC]] Juan S. Restrepo is killed, as well as another team member, PFC Vimoto. The film portrays negotiations with the local people, construction of an advanced outpost called \"OP Restrepo\", as well as the challenges and intermittent fire-fights they face.\n\nIn the latter part of the film, the dangerous mission [[Operation Rock Avalanche]] is shown along with some of its tragic consequences.  One event was the loss to Battle Company<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/magazine/24afghanistan-t.html|title=Afghanistan \u2013 Korengal Valley \u2013 United States Military \u2013 Counterinsurgency|last=Rubin|first=Elizabeth|date=2008-02-24|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-08-26}}</ref> of Army Sgt. Larry Rougle. It was there, in 2007, when Army Sgt. Rougle, who served two tours in Iraq and three in Afghanistan, was ambushed by a large number of Taliban. It was learned that Rougle, at point, took the brunt of the attack, allowing his soldiers to secure a position and fight. Army Sgt. Larry Rougle, who is a recipient of the Purple Heart, is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nRestrepo is a film not just about the events of combat, but also about \"brotherhood,\" according to Junger.<ref>{{Citation|last=Junger|first=Sebastian|title=Why veterans miss war|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_junger_why_veterans_miss_war?language=en|access-date=2016-08-26}}</ref> The film shows the dedication to their duty as a soldier and their commitment to one another as brothers.  The film is narrated by several men who fought with PFC Juan S. Restrepo. The men discuss loss such as [[Casualty (person)|dead civilians and soldiers]], as well as the [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|emotional distress]] that the soldiers are left with in its aftermath.\n\nThe film ends with a [[Post-credits scene|coda]] that reads: \"In April 2010, the United States Army withdrew from the Korengal Valley.
