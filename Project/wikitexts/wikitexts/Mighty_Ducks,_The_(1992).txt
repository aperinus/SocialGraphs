It was produced by [[Jordan Kerner|The Kerner Entertainment Company]] and Avnet\u2013Kerner Productions and distributed by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. It is the first film in [[The Mighty Ducks|''The Mighty Ducks'' film series]]. In some countries, the home release copies were printed with the title as ''The Mighty Ducks Are the Champions'' to avoid confusion with the title of [[D2: The Mighty Ducks|the sequel]].\n\nThe year after the film's release, Disney founded an [[National Hockey League|NHL]] hockey team, named the \"[[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]]\" after the film.\n\n==Plot==\nGordon Bombay ([[Emilio Estevez]]) is an arrogant but successful [[Minneapolis]] defense attorney. After his 30th successful case, he celebrates by going out drinking, but is arrested for [[drunk driving]] and sentenced to 500 hours of [[community service]] by coaching the local \"District 5\" [[Minor ice hockey|Pee-Wee hockey]] team. Bombay has an unpleasant history with the sport: as a youth in 1973, he was the Hawks\u2019 star player but, struggling with the loss of his father, he missed a penalty shot in the championship game, disappointing his hyper-competitive coach, Jack Reilly ([[Lane Smith]]). The Hawks went on to lose in overtime, becoming one of their only championship defeats.\n\nBombay meets the District 5 team, and realizes the children have no practice facility, equipment, or ability. Their first game with Bombay at the helm is against the Hawks. Reilly is still the Hawks' head coach and, despite a nearly unbroken championship streak, remains bitter about Gordon's missed penalty shot. District 5 is soundly defeated as Reilly demands the Hawks run up the score. Bombay berates the team for not listening to him, and the players challenge his authority. For the next match, Bombay tries to teach his team how to [[diving (ice hockey)|dive]] and draw penalties, which results in another loss \u2013 this time to the Jets \u2013 angering the team further. Specifically one player Charlie Conway  ([[Joshua Jackson]]), who refused to fake an injury like Bombay instructed him to.  Bombay visits his old mentor Hans ([[Joss Ackland]]), who owns a nearby sporting goods store and was in attendance at the game against the Hawks. While there, Bombay recalls that he quit playing hockey after losing his father four months before the championship game, and because Reilly blamed him for the loss due to the missed penalty shot. Hans encourages him to rekindle his childhood passion for the sport by skating in a frozen pond like he did when he was a kid.  Realizing the error of his ways, he apologizes to Charlie and his mother at their home.\n\nBombay approaches his boss, Gerald Ducksworth ([[Josef Sommer]]), to sponsor the team, allowing them to purchase professional-grade equipment as opposed to the makeshift \"tape-to-your-shins\" they had, and give Bombay time to teach the players fundamentals. Renamed the Ducks \u2013 after Ducksworth \u2013 the team fights its next game against the Cardinals to a tie. They recruit three new players: [[Figure skating]] siblings Tommy ([[Danny Tamberelli]]) and Tammy Duncan (Jane Plank), and slap shot specialist and [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcer]] Fulton Reed ([[Elden Henson]]). The potential of Charlie catches Bombay's eye; he takes Charlie under his wing and teaches him some of the tactics he used playing with the Hawks.\n\nBombay learns that, due to redistricting, the Hawks\u2019 star player Adam Banks ([[Vincent LaRusso]]) lives in District Five and should be playing for the Ducks, and threatens Reilly into transferring Banks to the Ducks. After overhearing an out-of-context quote about the team, most of the players walk out (except Charlie and Fulton who form a strong friendship), resulting in a loss on forfeit to the Flames. The Ducks lose faith in Bombay and revert to their old habits except Charlie and Fulton.\n\nDucksworth makes a deal with Reilly for the Hawks to keep Banks, which Bombay, although initially tempted, refuses on the principles of [[Sportsmanship|fair play]], which Ducksworth berated him about when he started his community service. Left with the choice of letting his team down or being fired from his job, he takes the latter.\n\nBombay manages to regain his players\u2019 trust after they win a crucial match against the Huskies in order to qualify for the playoffs, and Banks \u2013 who decided to play with the Ducks rather than not play hockey at all \u2013 proves to be an asset though Jesse doesn\u2019t trust him. The Ducks march through the playoffs with wins against the Hornets and the Cardinals, reaching the championship game against the Hawks. Reilly orders his team to injure Banks to force him out of the game; in spite of this, the Ducks manage to tie late in the final period, and Charlie is tripped by a Hawks player as time expires. In precisely the same situation Bombay faced in his youth, Charlie prepares for a game-deciding penalty shot. In stark contrast to Reilly \u2013 who told Bombay that if he missed, he was letting everyone down \u2013 Bombay tells Charlie to take his best shot and that he will believe in him no matter what. Inspired, Charlie fakes out the goalie with a \"triple-deke\" Bombay taught him and scores, winning the state championship.\n\nThe Ducks players and their families race onto the ice in jubilation, where Bombay thanks Hans for his belief in him and Hans tells Bombay he is proud of him; as Gordon is handed and raises the championship trophy, the team all rally around him and chant \"Ducks!\" repeatedly in triumphant unison. Some days later, Bombay boards a bus to a minor-league tryout, secured for him by the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Basil McRae]] of the [[Minnesota North Stars]], who played Pee-Wee hockey with him as a youth. Although daunted at the prospect of going up against younger players, he receives the same words of encouragement and advice from the Ducks he had given them, promising to return next season to defend their title.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Emilio Estevez]] as Gordon Bombay\n* [[Joss Ackland]] as Hans\n* [[Lane Smith]] as Coach Jack Reilly\n* Heidi Kling as Casey Conway\n* [[Josef Sommer]] as Mr. Gerald Ducksworth\n* [[Joshua Jackson]] as Charlie Conway, #96\n* [[Elden Henson]] as Fulton Reed, #44\n* [[Shaun Weiss]] as Greg Goldberg, #33\n* [[Brandon Adams (actor)|Brandon Adams]] as Jesse Hall, #9\n* [[M.
