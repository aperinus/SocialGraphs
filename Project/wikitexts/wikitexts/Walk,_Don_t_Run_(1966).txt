The film is a remake of the 1943 film ''[[The More the Merrier]]'' and is set  during the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]].\n\nThe title stems from the basic rule of [[racewalking]] that competitors must not at any point run (both feet leaving the ground).\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1964, important British businessman Sir William Rutland arrives two days early in [[Tokyo]] and runs afoul of the housing shortage caused by the [[1964 Summer Olympics]]. While at the British Embassy seeking help, he spots an advertisement for a roommate and decides to check the place out. He finds himself at the residence of Christine Easton, who insists that it would be improper to take him in as a housemate; she had forgotten to advertise that she wanted to sublet to a woman. Easton eventually lets Rutland stay.\n\nRutland sublets half of his space to American Olympic competitor Steve Davis. While Easton is less than thrilled with the arrangement, she has to put up with it, as she has already spent Rutland's share of the rent. Rutland sets about playing matchmaker for the two young people, in spite of their disparate personalities and Easton's engagement to a boringly dependable British diplomat, Julius P. Haversack.\n\nDavis repeatedly refuses to reveal what sport he is competing in. Rutland meddles in the young couple's romantic troubles. To further his matchmaking, he even strips down to his [[boxer shorts]] and a [[T-shirt]] so he can pretend to be a competitor and talk to Davis during his event, the 50-kilometre [[race walking|walk]], and eventually heals the breach between the young lovers.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Sir William Rutland \n* [[Samantha Eggar]] as Christine Easton \n* [[Jim Hutton]] as Steve Davis \n* [[John Standing]] as Julius P.
