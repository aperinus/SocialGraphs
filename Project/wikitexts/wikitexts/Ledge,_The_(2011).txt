It was released on July 8, 2011, being a [[box office bomb]] and panned by critics.\n\n==Plot==\nDetective Hollis Lucetti ([[Terrence Howard]]) receives news from a doctor that he has been [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]] his entire life. Upon reaching home, he questions his wife about who their children's father is.\n\nThe story switches to Gavin Nichols ([[Charlie Hunnam]]), an [[Atheism|atheist]], standing on the ledge of a tall building as if to jump to his death. A small crowd forms below Gavin, and Hollis responds to the emergency. At first it looks like a regular suicide attempt. It is quickly revealed to be more complex than that, as Gavin explains to Hollis that he has no other choice than to jump, or somebody else will die.\n\nThe story flashes back and describes the story of the love triangle between Gavin, Shana ([[Liv Tyler]]) and Joe ([[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]]). Shana is the new girl at the hotel where Gavin works. She lives with her husband Joe in an apartment just down the hall from Gavin's. Joe is a [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christian]] who infantilizes Shana. During a visit one night, Gavin and Joe discuss religion. Gavin neatly picks apart Joe's [[Born again (Christianity)|born again belief system]], pointing out that most of the people on Earth would go to Hell, even Catholics, if Joe's faith were correct. Gavin points out that a Chinese child who dies in a traffic accident might never even know about Jesus, and therefore has no chance to be born again. Joe's response is that such an example is not proof of God's unfairness, but merely the reason why Christians are called to proselytize. Their discussion heats up into a full blown argument that ends when Shana asks Gavin to leave.\n\nAt work, Shana notices Gavin consoling one of his grief-stricken employees with talk about God. He puts on a genuine act as a believer which helps calm the employee down. On a walk with Gavin one day, she confides in him that she used to be a drug addict and a prostitute. She ended up with a [[Prostitution#Etymology and terminology|john]] one night who liked to have sex in empty churches. He beat her badly afterward, and Joe discovered her in the sanctuary. Joe helped her turn her life around, and she feels an immense debt of gratitude to him. She tells Gavin that Joe wants them to move to [[Uganda]] to spread God's word.\n\nGavin and Shana spend more time with each other, and they eventually begin an affair. Joe quickly deduces what is going on and witnesses their assignations. He confronts Gavin as he is leaving for work and insists that he join him for a talk. In his apartment, Joe tells Gavin that he previously had a wife and two kids, but he would leave them at night to score drugs and hookers and do all kinds of depraved things. He lost his family and was drunk in a gutter when he was born again. He believes that, after God had already given him so much, God gave him Shana to take care of. He quotes [[Psalm 23]] to Gavin and forces him at gunpoint to read [[Leviticus]] 20:10, \"If a man commits adultery with another man\u2019s wife\u2014with the wife of his neighbor\u2014both the adulterer and the adulteress are to be put to death.\"\n\nGavin counters with the story of the adulteress from [[Gospel of John|John 8]], whom Jesus saves by ordering only those without sin to cast a stone at her. Joe agrees that Gavin has a point, but he questions whether Gavin has the conviction to die for his beliefs. The next day, when Shana is supposed to leave Joe, Gavin is waiting for her to call. Joe calls Gavin instead and orders him to the top of a building. Joe has decided that, \"I'm more of an Old Testament kind of guy\", but instead of killing both Gavin and Shana, only one of them has to die. Joe has Shana at gunpoint and will kill her at noon if Gavin does not jump off the building.\n\nLucetti grows increasingly desperate to save Gavin. He tells him more about his story, explaining that his wife committed adultery out of love and fear that she would lose her husband. She wanted their children to look as much like Lucetti as possible. So, she slept with his younger brother. Gavin scolds Lucetti for focusing too much on the pain of his wife's betrayal instead of the love that motivated her. He asks Lucetti to tell Shana he loves her before jumping off the building. The police find Joe and Shana in a hotel room with a direct view of Gavin's suicide. Joe is arrested. Lucetti goes home to his wife and kids, seemingly determined to reconcile.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Charlie Hunnam]] as Gavin Nichols\n* [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Joe\n* [[Liv Tyler]] as Shana\n* [[Terrence Howard]] as Hollis Lucetti\n* [[Christopher Gorham]] as Chris\n\n==Production==\nChapman, an atheist who identifies himself as a distant relative of [[Charles Darwin]], wrote the character of Gavin Nichols to be the first openly atheist hero in a story about religious conflict.<ref>[http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/07/08/new-atheist-movie-the-ledge-evangelizes-godlessness/ New atheist movie 'The Ledge' evangelizes godlessness]</ref>  According to Chapman, it is \"the first pro-atheist feature film ever to be released in America.\"  His goal was to \"put out a piece of work that makes the basic intellectual arguments for atheism, but also makes a powerful emotional argument against cruelty of a religious kind\" and the \"ways people suffer as a result.\"<ref name=SK>{{cite web|title=Skepticality podcast|url=https://www.skepticality.com/ledge/|website=Skepticality episode from 28 June 2011|accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nChapman was able to recruit his desired actors starting with Hunnam and the film was shot in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] in March 2010.<ref>[http://voices.yahoo.com/my-interview-writer-director-matthew-chapman-8752225.html?cat=40 My Interview with Writer/Director Matthew Chapman] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214032100/http://voices.yahoo.com/my-interview-writer-director-matthew-chapman-8752225.html?cat=40 |date=2013-12-14 }}</ref><ref>[https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/01/22/sundance-2011-terrence-howard-walks-the-ledge/ Terrence Howard Walks \u2018The Ledge\u2019]</ref>\nThe film premiered in the U.S. Dramatic Competition at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sundance.slated.com/2011/films/theledge_sundance2011 |title=Sundance Film Festival 2011 : The Ledge |work=Sundance.Slated.com |accessdate=January 22, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216021428/http://sundance.slated.com/2011/films/theledge_sundance2011 |archivedate=December 16, 2010 }}</ref>\nShortly after its premiere, [[IFC (U.S. TV network)|IFC]] paid just over $1 million to win the domestic rights to the film over three other bidders.<ref>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/risky-business/sundance-ifc-picks-liv-tyler-74746 SUNDANCE EXCLUSIVE: IFC Picks Up Liv Tyler Thriller 'The Ledge']</ref>\n  \nThe film was primarily available on IFC's On Demand channel as it was given a very limited release in just 2 domestic theaters (making $9,216).
