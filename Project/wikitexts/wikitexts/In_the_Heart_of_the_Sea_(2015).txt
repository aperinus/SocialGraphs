It is based on [[Nathaniel Philbrick]]'s 2000 non-fiction [[In the Heart of the Sea|book of the same name]], about the sinking of the American [[whaleship|whaling ship]] ''[[Essex (whaleship)|Essex]]'' in 1820, an event that in part inspired [[Herman Melville]]'s 1851 novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]''. An [[international co-production]] between the United States and Spain, the film stars [[Chris Hemsworth]], [[Benjamin Walker (actor)|Benjamin Walker]], [[Cillian Murphy]], [[Tom Holland]], [[Ben Whishaw]], and [[Brendan Gleeson]].\n\nThe film premiered in [[New York City]] on December 7, 2015, and was released in cinemas in the United States on December 11, 2015, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. ''In the Heart of the Sea'' received mixed reviews from critics and was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing only $93 million against a $100 million budget.<ref name=\"BOM\"/><ref>{{Cite web |title=\u2018In The Heart Of The Sea\u2019: What The Hell Happened? \u2013 Sunday Box Office Report |url=https://deadline.com/2015/12/the-heart-of-the-sea-box-office-why-it-bombed-1201666007/ |access-date=July 20, 2022 |website=Deadline}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1850, author [[Herman Melville]] visits innkeeper [[Thomas Nickerson]], the last survivor of the sinking of the whaleship ''[[Essex (whaleship)|Essex]]'', offering money in return for his story. Nickerson initially refuses, but then finally agrees when his wife intervenes.\n\nThe story turns to 1820: a [[whaling]] company in [[Nantucket]] has refitted the ''Essex'' to participate in a [[whale hunt]] and get back some lucrative [[whale oil]], and 14-year-old Nickerson signs on as a [[cabin boy]]. The owners hire veteran whaler [[Owen Chase]] as first mate, though he is disappointed not to receive a captain's commission. The captain is [[George Pollard, Jr.|George Pollard]], an inexperienced mariner from an established whaling family who envies Chase's skill and popularity. Chase and Pollard clash, leading Pollard to sail into a storm against Chase's advice. The two agree to put their differences aside, rather than risking their reputations by returning to port without profit, and soon, the crew kills their first bull sperm whale.\n\nThree months pass with no further successes, and Pollard realizes that the [[Atlantic Ocean]] holds no sighting of whales. The ''Essex'' sails past [[Cape Horn]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], hoping for better luck in catching one. In [[Atacames]], [[Ecuador]], the officers meet a Spanish captain who tells them his crew found the bountiful \"Offshore Grounds\" 2,000 miles to the west, but claims that a vengeful \"white whale\" destroyed his ship, killing six of his men. Dismissing the story as a myth, Pollard and Chase lead the expedition west. They find the undisturbed grounds, but when they launch the whaling boats, a massive bull [[sperm whale]], its skin whitened by scars, attacks; damaging the boats and turning on the ship.\n\nChase [[harpoon]]s it from the ''Essex''{{'}}s deck, but the whale rams the ship's hull, killing two men. With the hull stove in and pumps not working, the crew abandons the sinking ''Essex'' in the three intact whaling boats, and must sail hundreds of miles to shore with very limited supplies. The whale follows and attacks again, but they escape to the tiny [[Henderson Island (Pitcairn Islands)|Henderson Island]], George Pollard presumes it could be [[Ducie Island]], and admits there is no way to be certain without instruments. While gathering food, Chase discovers the long dead corpses of earlier [[castaway]]s, after which the crew fears that they might die waiting on the island before another ship passes by. Just four men decide to stay, while the rest set sail again on the boats, with the hope of drifting along the [[trade winds]] and finding better lands. Soon after, one of the men dies, and the remaining crew reluctantly decide to [[Human cannibalism|cannibalise]] him.\n\nThe older Nickerson is overcome with remorse for his cannibalism and stops his story, thinking his wife could not love him if she knew about it; however, when his wife comforts him, assuring him that she still loves him, he feels encouraged enough to finish. Back in the 1820s, the three boats are separated by the currents and one is lost. The other two further resort to cannibalism to survive, with Pollard's cousin Henry Coffin sacrificing himself.\n\nThe white whale suddenly returns, and Chase gets into position for a final attack. The whale breaches for a moment, allowing Chase to observe a portion of his previously thrown harpoon still embedded above the whale's eye. Chase hesitates, and stares into the whale's left eye, as the whale stares back at Chase. After a moment of thought, Chase lowers his harpoon, deciding not to kill the creature. Following this encounter, the whale swims away peacefully, and is never seen again.\n\nA passing ship rescues Pollard's boat, but Chase's boat continues to drift with no food or water. Finally, with the survivors on the verge of death, the latter's boat reaches [[Chile]]'s [[Alejandro Selkirk Island]]. The survivors are all brought back to Nantucket, where they finally reunite with their distraught families. The Nantucket ships' owners ask Pollard and Chase to cover up the story to protect the industry's reputation, but Chase, deciding he has had enough of their dishonesty and that he no longer cares about them, refuses to go along and resigns. Pollard reveals the truth in the inquiry, much to their anger.\n\nNickerson relates that a ship was sent to Henderson Island to rescue the surviving men there, Chase continued sailing the seas and became a merchant captain, which his wife had said earlier would not change her love for him, and Pollard led another expedition to find and kill the whale. However, he was never able to find the animal and the ship ran aground off the [[Hawai]]ian Islands and was forced to retire. Melville departs to compose his novel, ''[[Moby-Dick]],'' beginning by writing its first line: \"[[Ishmael (Moby-Dick)|Call me Ishmael]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Owen Chase]], the first mate<ref name=IFTN />\n* [[Benjamin Walker (actor)|Benjamin Walker]] as [[George Pollard Jr.|Captain George Pollard Jr.]]\n* [[Cillian Murphy]] as Matthew Joy, the second mate<ref name=IFTN>{{cite web|url=http://www.iftn.ie/news/?act1=record&only=1&aid=73&rid=4286560&tpl=archnews&force=1|publisher=The Irish Film & Television Network|title=Cillian Murphy's 'Peaky Blinders' Renewed for a Second Season|last=Browne|first=Julie |date=29 October 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Tom Holland]] as [[Thomas Nickerson]], the cabin boy\n:* [[Brendan Gleeson]]<ref name=IFTN /> as Old Thomas Nickerson\n* [[Ben Whishaw]] as [[Herman Melville]]<ref name=IFTN />\n* [[Michelle Fairley]] as Mrs. Nickerson\n* [[Gary Beadle]] as William Bond\n* [[Frank Dillane]] as [[Owen Coffin]] (named Henry Coffin in the film)\n* Edward Ashley as Barzillai Ray\n* [[Charlotte Riley]] as Peggy Chase<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/10/in-the-heart-of-the-sea-charlotte-riley-cheyenne-jackson-the-song/|website=Deadline Hollywood|title='In The Heart Of The Sea' Adds Charlotte Riley; Cheyenne Jackson To Sing 'The Song'|date=15 October 2013|first=Jen |last=Yamato}}</ref> \n* [[Donald Sumpter]] as Paul Mason\n* Brooke Dimmock as Phoebe Chase\n* [[Jamie Sives]] as Isaac Cole\n* [[Joseph Mawle]] as Benjamin Lawrence\n* [[Paul Anderson (actor)|Paul Anderson]] as Caleb Chappel\n* Luca Tosi as William Wright\n* [[Sam Keeley]] as Ramsdell\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\nThe film was in development back in 2000, with [[Barry Levinson]] set to direct for [[Miramax Films]].<ref name=IndieWire>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/chris-hemsworth-to-topline-maritime-adventure-in-the-heart-of-the-sea-dreamworks-circling-20120611|publisher=Indie Wire|title=Chris Hemsworth To Topline Maritime Adventure 'In The Heart Of The Sea,' DreamWorks Circling|first=Kevin|last=Jagernauth|date=11 June 2012|access-date=30 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020163945/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/chris-hemsworth-to-topline-maritime-adventure-in-the-heart-of-the-sea-dreamworks-circling-20120611|archive-date=October 20, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Chris Hemsworth]] was cast to play the lead, [[Owen Chase]], in June 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2012/06/chris-hemsworth-boards-whale-of-a-tale-in-in-the-heart-of-the-sea-will-dreamworks-bite-284524/|title=Chris Hemsworth Boards Whale Of A Tale 'In The Heart Of The Sea'; Will DreamWorks Bite?|author=Mike Fleming Jr|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=June 11, 2012|access-date=December 8, 2015}}</ref> [[Tom Holland]] won the role of young Nickerson in April 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2013/04/ron-howard-in-the-heart-of-the-sea-tom-holland-moby-dick-472175/|title=Ron Howard Whaling Tale 'In The Heart Of The Sea' Casts Tom Holland|author=Jen Yamato|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=April 10, 2013|access-date=December 8, 2015}}</ref> [[Cillian Murphy]] signed on as Matthew Joy in June.
