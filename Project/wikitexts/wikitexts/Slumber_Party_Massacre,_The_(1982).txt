It is the first installment in the [[Massacre (franchise)|''Slumber Party Massacre'' trilogy]], and stars Michelle Michaels, [[Robin Stille]], and Michael Villella. The film follows a high school senior who gathers her friends for a slumber party, unaware that an escaped power drill-wielding killer is loose in the neighborhood.\n\nThe film was originally written by Brown as a [[parody]] of the slasher genre but was shot as a straightforward horror film instead. As a result, it contains more humor, both intended and unintended, than usual for the genre at the time.\n\n''The Slumber Party Massacre'' grossed $3.6 million at the box office on a budget of $220,000, and received mixed reviews from critics. Despite the reception, it has obtained a large [[cult following]] since its release. Two [[sequel]]s, ''[[Slumber Party Massacre II]]'' and ''[[Slumber Party Massacre III]]'', followed in 1987 and 1990, respectively, with [[Slumber Party Massacre (2021 film)|a reboot]] following in 2021.{{Sfn|Shary|2014|p=182}}\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Venice, Los Angeles]], Trish Deveraux, an 18-year-old high school senior, decides to throw a [[slumber party]] while her parents are away. Their neighbor, Mr. David Contant, is given the job of checking on the girls. She awakes and gets dressed shortly before going to school. Meanwhile, Russ Thorn, an escaped mass murderer, kills a telephone repair woman and steals her van. Trish meets up with her friends Kim, Jackie, and Diane. She invites the new girl, Valerie, to the party but she declines the offer. After school, one of their classmates, Linda, goes back into the school to retrieve a book but gets locked inside. She is attacked and presumably killed by Russ, armed with a [[drill|power drill]]. As the party begins that night, the girls smoke [[marijuana]] and drink [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], while Valerie babysits her younger sister, Courtney, across the street. Two boys from school, Jeff and Neil, arrive and spy on the girls while they change clothes. Russ kills Mr. Contant outside with his power drill. Diane asks Trish permission to go with her boyfriend, and goes to his car to find him decapitated and is murdered as well.\n\nThe girls order pizza and, while on the phone with their coach, Rachel Jana, the girls answer the door and find the pizza delivery man with his eyes drilled out. The teens arm themselves with knives as Jeff and Neil run for help, but both boys are killed. Russ gains entry to the house and murders Jackie. Trish and Kim barricade themselves in Trish's bedroom, but Russ enters through a window and kills Kim as Trish flees. Valerie and Courtney enter the house to find Kim dead, and hide from Russ. Coach Jana, having grown concerned over the phone call earlier, arrives and is confronted by Russ, who [[disembowelment|disembowels]] her with the drill. Valerie chases Russ with a machete, eventually severing his hand before slicing his stomach open. Russ falls into a swimming pool and sinks beneath the water, only to emerge moments later and attack them once more, but Valerie finally kills him with the machete. Valerie and Trish break down in tears as Courtney looks on in [[Acute stress disorder|shock]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n*Michelle Michaels (credited as Michele Michaels) as Trish Devereaux\n*[[Robin Stille]] as Valerie Bates\n*Michael Villella as Russ Thorn\n*Debra Deliso as Kim Clarke\n*Andree Honore as Jackie Cassidy\n*Gina Mari as Diane\n*Jennifer Meyers as Courtney Bates\n*Joseph Alan Johnson as Neil\n*David Millbern as Jeff\n*Jim Reid Boyce as John Raden Minor\n*Pamela Roylance as Coach Rachel Jana\n*[[Brinke Stevens]] as Linda Dawn Grant\n*Rigg Kennedy as David Contant\n*Jean Vargas as Mary (Telephone Repairwoman)\n*Howard Purgason as Mr. Devereaux\n*Anna Patton as Mrs. Annette Devereaux\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Conception===\nAuthor and feminist activist [[Rita Mae Brown]] wrote the original screenplay, titled ''Sleepless Nights'', as a parody of the [[slasher film]].
