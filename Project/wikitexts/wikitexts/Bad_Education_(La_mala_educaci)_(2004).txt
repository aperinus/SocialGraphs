Starring [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]], [[Fele Mart\u00ednez]], [[Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho]], [[Llu\u00eds Homar]] and Francisco Boira, the film focuses on two reunited childhood friends and lovers caught up in a stylised [[murder mystery]]. Along with [[metafiction]], [[sexual abuse]] by [[Catholic priest]]s, [[transsexuality]] and [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] are also important themes and devices in the plot. The film received an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|NC-17]] rating in the United States for a depiction of homosexual sex.\n\nThe film was released on 19 March 2004 in Spain and 10 September 2004 in Mexico. It was also screened at many international film festivals such as Cannes, New York, Moscow and Toronto before its US release on 19 November 2004. The film received critical acclaim, and was seen as a return to Almodovar's dark stage, placing it alongside films such as ''[[Matador (film)|Matador]]'' (1986) and ''[[Law of Desire]]'' (1987).\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1980 Madrid, young film director Enrique Goded is looking for his next project when he receives the unexpected visit of an actor looking for work. The actor claims to be Enrique's boarding school friend and first love, Ignacio Rodriguez. Ignacio, who is now using the name \u00c1ngel Andrade, has brought a short story titled \"The Visit,\" hoping that Enrique would be interested in making a film out of it and give her the starring role. Enrique is intrigued since \"The Visit\" describes their time together at the Catholic [[boarding school]] and it also includes a fictionalized account of their reunion many years later as adults.\n\n\"The Visit\" is set in 1977. It tells the story of a [[transgender]] [[drag queen]] with the stage name Zahara, whose birth name is Ignacio. Zahara plans to rob a drunken admirer but discovers that the man is her boyhood lover Enrique. Next she visits her old school and confronts Father Manolo, who abused her when she was a boy. She demands one million pesetas from him in exchange for halting publication of her story \"The Visit\". The story is set in a Catholic boarding school for boys in 1964. At the school, Ignacio, a young boy with a beautiful singing voice, is the object of lust of Father Manolo, the [[School Principal|school principal]] and literature teacher. Ignacio falls in love with a young Enrique, and the two go the local cinema and grope each other. Manolo discovers them together that night. Although Ignacio allows Manolo to molest him in exchange for not punishing Enrique, he expels him nonetheless.\n\nEnrique wants to [[Film adaptation|adapt]] the story but balks at \u00c1ngel's condition to be cast as Zahara, feeling that the Ignacio whom he loved and the Ignacio of today are totally different people. He drives to see Ignacio's mother in [[Ortigueira]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and learns that the real Ignacio has been dead for four years and that the man who came to his office is actually Ignacio's younger brother, Juan. Enrique's interest is piqued, and he decides to do the film with Juan in the role of Ignacio to find out what drives Juan. Enrique and \u00c1ngel start a relationship, and Enrique revises the script so that it ends with Father Manolo, whom Ignacio was trying to blackmail to get money for [[sex reassignment surgery]], having Ignacio murdered. When the scene is shot, \u00c1ngel breaks out in tears unexpectedly.\n\nThe film set is visited by Manuel Berenguer, who is the real Father Manolo, who has resigned from Church duty. Berenguer confesses to Enrique that the new ending of the film is not far from the truth: the real Ignacio blackmailed Berenguer, who somehow managed to scratch together the money but also took an interest in Ignacio's younger brother, Juan. Juan and Manolo started a relationship and after a while realized they both wanted to see Ignacio dead. Juan scored some very pure [[heroin]], so that his brother would die by [[Drug overdose|overdose]] after [[Intravenous drug abuse|shooting up]]. After the crime, the relationship disintegrates; Berenguer wants to continue the relationship with Juan, but Juan is uninterested. Berenguer claims that he will never let Juan go, and Juan threatens to kill him if Berenguer continues to pursue him. Berenguer attempts to blackmail Juan for his part in the murder of Ignacio. Enrique is shocked and not at all interested in Juan's weak vindications for what he did to his brother. Finally, before he leaves, Juan gives Enrique a piece of paper: a letter to Enrique that Ignacio was in the middle of typing when he died reading \"I think I have succeeded...\"\n\nAn [[epilogue]] states that after the release of the film Juan and Enrique both achieved great success, although Juan was later relegated to television acting after his career declined in the 1990s and killed Berenguer in a [[Hit and run|hit-and-run]] because of his continued blackmailing of him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]] as Juan / \u00c1ngel Andrade / Zahara \n* [[Fele Mart\u00ednez]] as Enrique Goded\n** Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda Forneiro as young Enrique\n* [[Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho]] as Father Manolo\n* [[Javier C\u00e1mara]] as Paca/Paquito\n* [[Petra Mart\u00ednez]] as Mother\n* [[Leonor Watling]] as Monica, wardrobe girl\n* [[Llu\u00eds Homar]] as Sr. Manuel Berenguer\n* Francisco Boira as Ignacio\n** Nacho P\u00e9rez as young Ignacio\n* [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez (Spanish actor)|Juan Fern\u00e1ndez]] as Mart\u00edn\n* Alberto Ferreiro as Enrique Serrano\n}}\n\n==Production==\nGarc\u00eda Bernal was required to display a convincing [[Castilian Spanish]] accent before being cast.<ref name=Epps>{{cite book|editor1-first=Bradley S.|editor1-last=Epps|editor2-first=Despina|editor2-last=Kakoudaki|title=All about Almod\u00f3var: A Passion for Cinema|publisher=[[University of Minnesota]]|location=Saint Paul, Minnesota|date=2009|ISBN=978-0816649617|page=286}}</ref>\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter Lynn Hirschberg<ref name=Epps/> stated that Bernal had a falling out with Almodovar over the film's content; Bernal denied that assertion.<ref name=\"Ryll 2014\">{{cite web |url=http://gay-themed-films.com/watch-bad-education/ |title=Essential Gay Themed Films To Watch, Bad Education (La Mala Educacion) |last=Ryll |first=Alexander |website=Gay Essential |access-date=7 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115012521/http://gay-themed-films.com/watch-bad-education/ |archive-date=15 January 2020}}</ref> Bernal and Almod\u00f3var had different ideas on the type of 'inner transvestite' in terms of Bernal's performance.<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Brigitte|editor-last=Peucker|title=A Companion to Rainer Werner Fassbinder|publisher=[[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]]|location=New York City|date=2012|ISBN=978-1405191630|page=134}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Almod\u00f3var, he worked on the screenplay for over 10 years.<ref name=\"variety\">{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117913077.html?categoryid=1852&cs=1 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130105153953/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117913077.html?categoryid=1852&cs=1 |title=Almodovar puts 'Education' to use |access-date=20 June 2009 |archive-date=5 January 2013 |last=De La Fuente |first=Anna Marie |date=4 November 2004 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was theatrically released in Spain on 19 March 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2004/05/25/cultura/1085509436.html|website=[[El Mundo (Spain)|elmundo.es]]|title='La mala educaci\u00f3n', la tercera pel\u00edcula m\u00e1s taquillera de Francia|date=25 May 2004}}</ref>\nIt opened in the [[2004 Cannes Film Festival|57th Cannes Film Festival]] in May 2004,<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4185283/year/2004.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Bad Education |access-date=5 December 2009 |work=festival-cannes.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010231947/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4185283/year/2004.html |archive-date=10 October 2012}}</ref> the first Spanish film to do so.\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened theatrically in the United States on 19 November 2004 in three venues, earning $147,370 in its opening weekend, ranking number 30 in the domestic box office.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2004&wknd=47&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for November 19-21, 2004 | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | date=22 November 2004 | access-date=24 November 2015}}</ref> At the end of its North American theatrical run (its widest release being in 106 venues), the film had grossed $5,211,842 in the United States and Canada, and $35,062,088 overseas ($7,356,224 in its home country of Spain), making $40,273,930 worldwide.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web | url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=badeducation.htm | title=Bad Education (2004) | work=Box Office Mojo | date=26 April 2005 | access-date=20 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film received critical acclaim.
