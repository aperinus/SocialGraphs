It focuses on a gang of outlaws who find their way to a hidden valley and a peaceful town where residents shun swearing, alcohol, guns and any kind of violence but resemble dead Western heroes. The outcome is marked by its exploration of the interface between legend-making and humanitarian values.\n\n==Plot==\nA violent outlaw band led by Blackjack Britton and Cavin Guthrie robs a bank. During the subsequent gunfight, a prostitute named Dolly Sloan is shot and dies in the arms of Cavin's nephew, Sonny. The gang flees, pursued by a [[wikt:posse|posse]], and manages to escape through a dust storm by following a tunnel into a green valley. The town of Refuge welcomes them, but they are puzzled by the residents, who do not carry guns or swear, and who flock to the church whenever the bell tolls.\n\nThe youngest gang member, Sonny, thinks he recognizes some of them from the [[dime novels]] he reads. He befriends a woman named Rose who deflects his questions and asks some pointed ones of her own, beginning with \u201cHow many men have you killed?\u201d The rest of the outlaws occupy the saloon and begin causing trouble. One of the gang members is struck by lightning when he prepares to throw his knife at the church door. His body is carried away by a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], who guards the gates to a mist-filled property outside of town.\n\nAs Sonny investigates further, he realizes that the town appears to be occupied by former notorious gunfighters. These include [[Wild Bill Hickok]], the town's Sheriff, [[Jesse James]], [[Billy the Kid]] and [[Doc Holliday]], although they deny their identities to Sonny. Later he talks to a gardener named Lamb whom he prompts to admit who he really is. Before Sonny can ask more questions, some of Blackjack's men tear up Lamb's garden. Enraged, he beats one to death with his shovel and is led away by the mysterious Gatekeeper.\n\nWhile talking to Doc, Sonny lets slip the true nature of their gang and the Sheriff asks them to saddle up and leave town. Blackjack orders all his men to assemble in the saloon except Sonny, who is ejected but steals back and overhears the gang planning to rob the town on their way out, while Cavin plans to rape Rose. Sonny joins the townspeople in church, where he begs them to defend themselves. They finally admit to Sonny that Refuge is a form of [[Purgatory]]. If they can go ten years while resisting the temptations of their former lives, they are admitted to [[Heaven]]. They are therefore reluctant to face off against Blackjack's gang because it will cost them their respite. A frustrated Sonny leaves the church and is jumped by Blackjack and Cavin, who beat him unconscious.\n\nThe next morning, a battered Sonny straps on his guns and prepares to face Blackjack's gang alone.  The townspeople are summoned by the church bells, but while most of them comply, Hickok, Holliday, James, and Billy all join Sonny, inspired by his willingness to die to protect Rose. A shootout erupts, during which Blackjack's gang are all slaughtered, but Cavin manages to shoot Sonny before being killed by him in return. Sonny, despite being fatally wounded, does not feel pain and does not die. Hickok welcomes him to Refuge, realizing that Sonny has earned his second chance. When Blackjack arrives and challenges Hickok, he loses. \"I guess I'm one of you now,\" Blackjack jokes, realizing the truth of the situation. \"I wouldn't count on it,\" Hickok replies before finally dispatching his opponent.\n\nThe Gatekeeper carries the bodies of Cavin and Blackjack beyond the misty gates to the edge of [[Hell|a fiery pit]], into which they are thrown screaming. Hickok and the others grimly follow, but the stagecoach arrives and the driver tells them that by their willingness to sacrifice their chance of a better future to protect the others, they have secured a place in Heaven. \"The Creator may be tough, but He ain't blind,\" he says. Sonny asks to stay behind with Rose, and Hickok hands him the Sheriff's badge.  The coach then leaves, riding upwards into the light.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sam Shepard]] as Sheriff Forrest / [[Wild Bill Hickok|'Wild Bill' Hickok]]\n* [[Eric Roberts]] as Jack 'Blackjack' Britton\n* [[Randy Quaid]] as Doc Woods / [[Doc Holliday|'Doc' Holliday]]\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Cavin Guthrie\n* [[Brad Rowe (actor)|Brad Rowe]] as Leon 'Sonny' Miller\n* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as Deputy Glen / [[Billy The Kid|Billy 'The Kid']]\n* [[J.D.

Davis later provided a chapter examining ''Purgatory's'' surreal and religious themes in the compilation ''Undead in the West''. This is a wry meditation on the changes rung on legend in the film, where the heroes portrayed had already been immortalized by reputation while still alive; now they are \u2018dead\u2019 they must earn their immortal redemption by giving up everything that had earned them their reputation in the first place. Parallels are also drawn between the [[dime novel]]s that contributed to the making of the Western legends, of which Sonny Dillard is an avid reader, and the celluloid embroidering of the same legends. ''[[High Noon]]'' in particular, the prototype of the climactic final shootout, had gone through many variations in later films, and references to several of these exist in ''Purgatory''. But informing everything else there is Dante's ''[[Purgatorio]]'', the theology of which permeates Uli Edel's film, according to Davis.<ref>Scarecrow Press, 2012, \"Moving West and Beyond: Life in the Midst of Death in ''Purgatory''\", [https://books.google.com/books?id=4gNHIbC6CXoC&pg=PA221&lpg=PA221&dq=purgatory+saginaw+grant&source=bl&ots=QDusgA3BJJ&sig=ACfU3U3ka2kmaJeJ2MHthLGgT0KQgoKe_w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwib9-Sa_sbgAhWQA3wKHaYECiU4ChDoATACegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=purgatory%20saginaw%20grant&f=false chapter 14, pp.220\u201336]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0158131|Purgatory}}\n\n{{Uli Edel}}\n\n[[Category:1999 television films]]\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1999 fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Western (genre) television films]]\n[[Category:American television films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Billy the Kid]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Doc Holliday]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Jesse James]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Wild Bill Hickok]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Uli Edel]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Brad Fiedel]]\n[[Category:Films set in ghost towns]]\n[[Category:Fiction about purgatory]]\n[[Category:TNT Network original films]]"}]}}}}
