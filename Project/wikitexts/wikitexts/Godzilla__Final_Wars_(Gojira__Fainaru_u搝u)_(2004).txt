An international co-production between Japan, Australia, the United States, and China, the film was produced by [[Toho|Toho Studios]], CP International, Zazou Productions, and Napalm Films. It is the 29th film in the [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' franchise]], the sixth and final film in the franchise's [[Godzilla (franchise)#Millennium era (1999\u20132004)|Millennium series]] and the 28th Godzilla film produced by Toho.\nThe film stars<!-- Order based on billing block --> [[Masahiro Matsuoka]], [[Rei Kikukawa]], [[Don Frye]], [[Maki Mizuno]], [[Kazuki Kitamura]], [[Kane Kosugi]], [[Kumi Mizuno]], [[Kenji Sahara]], [[Masami Nagasawa]], [[Chihiro Otsuka]], [[Shigeru Izumiya]], [[Masakatsu Funaki]], [[Masato Ibu]], [[Jun Kunimura]], and [[Akira Takarada]]. In the film, when a mysterious race of aliens known as the Xiliens arrive on Earth, the Earth Defense Force find themselves locked in battle with various monsters attacking cities around the world, leading them to revive the only chance to save their planet: Godzilla.\n\nThe film coincided with the 50th anniversary of the franchise, and as such, the film features a variety of actors and ''kaiju'' from previous films. ''Godzilla: Final Wars'' premiered on November 29, 2004 in [[Los Angeles, California]], and was released theatrically in Japan on December 4, 2004. Before the world premiere, Godzilla received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-11-30-godzilla_x.htm|title=Godzilla gets Hollywood Walk of Fame star|last=Dovarganes|first=Damian|work=USA Today|date=November 30, 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDuring a battle in [[Antarctica]] with the original ''[[Atragon|Gotengo]]'', the monster [[Godzilla]] is entrapped under ice by a cave-in caused by a series of missiles fired off from the submarine. In 20XX, environmental disasters cause the appearance of giant monsters and superhumans, dubbed \"mutants\", who are then recruited into the Earth Defense Force (EDF) to battle the monsters. An upgraded ''Gotengo'', commanded by Captain Douglas Gordon, battles and destroys [[Manda (kaiju)|Manda]] in the [[English Channel]] off the coast of [[Normandy]], but the ship is wrecked in the process and Gordon is suspended from the EDF.\n\nMutant soldier Shinichi Ozaki is tasked with guarding a [[United Nations|U.N.]] biologist, Dr. Miyuki Otonashi, who is sent to study a mummified monster. They are teleported to Infant Island where they encounter the Shobijin, fairies of [[Mothra]], who reveal the mummified monster as [[Gigan]], an alien cyborg sent to destroy the Earth who was ultimately defeated by Mothra. They warn that a battle between good and evil will happen soon and that Ozaki must choose a side. Suddenly, giant monsters attack several major cities: [[Rodan]] attacks [[New York City]], [[Anguirus]] attacks [[Shanghai]], [[Zilla (TriStar Godzilla)|Zilla]] attacks [[Sydney]], [[King Caesar]] attacks [[Okinawa]], [[Kamacuras]] attacks [[Paris]], [[Kumonga]] attacks [[Monument Valley]] in [[Arizona]], [[Ebirah]] attacks [[T\u014dkai, Ibaraki|Tokai]], and [[Hedorah]] attacks an unknown location. The EDF engages the creatures, until the monsters mysteriously vanish as an alien mothership appears over [[Tokyo]]. The aliens, named Xiliens, warn that an incoming planet called \"[[Gorath]]\" will soon impact the Earth, and offer their help to destroy it. A peace pact is signed between Earth and the Xiliens. Meanwhile, [[Minilla]], Godzilla's son, is found in the forests of Japan by Kenta Taguchi and his grandfather Samon Taguchi.\n\nDistrusting the Xiliens, Ozaki, Miyuki, and Miyuki's sister Anna discover that the Gorath shown by the Xiliens is actually a hologram and that the aliens have replaced several members of the EDF with duplicates. After the Xiliens are exposed with help from Gordon and the other mutants, the Xiliens' Controller (who called himself \"X\" during an interview on a radio show) kills his superior to assume command, revealing the plan to use humans as a food source while taking control of all the mutants except for Ozaki through a property in their DNA known as \"M-base\". X also has the monsters placed under his control through M-base in their DNA and awakens Gigan to wipe out the EDF. The group escapes in a repaired ''Gotengo'', although Gigan pursues them.  Gordon convinces them to travel to Antarctica to release Godzilla, who is immune to Xilien control thanks to his lack of M-base and easily destroys Gigan. The ''Gotengo'' then guides Godzilla into battle with the other monsters: he defeats [[Zilla (TriStar Godzilla)|Zilla]], [[Kumonga]],  [[Kamacuras]], [[Rodan]], [[King Caesar]], [[Anguirus]], [[Ebirah]], and [[Hedorah]], and then returns to Tokyo to engage the Xiliens. After penetrating the mothership, the humans are captured and brought before X as he summons Gorath to Earth. Godzilla destroys Gorath just before it crashes, but this unleashes Monster X and the two monsters battle. An upgraded Gigan joins Monster X but is intercepted by Mothra, who is gravely wounded while managing to destroy the cyborg.\n\nIn the Xilien ship, X reveals that both he and Ozaki are superior beings known as \"Keizers\", powerful beings distinct from regular mutants born on rare occasions when human DNA and M-base are combined, before directly taking control of Ozaki to turn him against the group. A fight breaks out, and X loses control of Ozaki due to the Shobijins' blessing. Ozaki unlocks his true power and defeats X, who triggers the ship's self-destruct as the group falls back to the ''Gotengo'' moments before the mothership explodes. Godzilla and Monster X continue their battle, but a dying X transfers his Keizer energy to Monster X, enabling it to transform into its final form, Keizer Ghidorah. Godzilla is nearly killed by Keizer Ghidorah, but Ozaki transfers some of his own Keizer energy to Godzilla, giving him the strength to emerge victorious. Godzilla then shoots down the ''Gotengo'', before turning his ire towards its crew after they leave the damaged vessel. Fortunately, Minilla shows up at the scene and convinces Godzilla not to kill the humans. The humans watch as Godzilla and Minilla return to the ocean.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Masahiro Matsuoka]] as Shinichi Ozaki\n* [[Rei Kikukawa]] as Miyuki Otonashi\n* [[Don Frye]] as Captain Douglas Gordon\n* [[Maki Mizuno]] as Anna Otonashi\n* [[Kazuki Kitamura]] as the Xilien Controller, aka \"X\"\n* [[Kane Kosugi]] as Kazama\n* [[Kumi Mizuno]] as Akiko Namikawa\n* [[Kenji Sahara]] as Dr. Jinguji\n* [[Masami Nagasawa]] and [[Chihiro Otsuka]] as the [[Mothra#Mothra's fairies|Shobijin]]\n* [[Shigeru Izumiya]] as Samon Taguchi\n* [[Masakatsu Funaki]] as Commander Kumasaka\n* [[Masat\u014d Ibu]] as the Xilien General\n* [[Jun Kunimura]] as Major Kumoro\n* [[Akira Takarada]] as Naotaro Daigo\n* [[Kenta Suga]] as Kenta Taguchi\n* [[Tsutomu Kitagawa]] as [[Godzilla]]\n* [[Naoko Kamio]] as [[Minilla]] and [[Rodan]]\n* Kazuhiro Yoshida as [[Gigan]] and [[Hedorah]]\n* Toshihiro Ogura as [[Anguirus]], and [[Ebirah]]\n* Motokuni Nakagawa as Monster X and [[King Caesar]] and Keizer Ghidorah\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Final Wars Godzilla.jpg|thumb|Godzilla's new design for ''Godzilla: Final Wars'' dubbed the ''FinalGoji''.]]\n\nRyuhei Kitamura accepted the offer to direct the film due to being unsatisfied with the ''Godzilla'' films of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, stating, \"I loved the Godzilla movies back in the \u201970s, but not so much the ones released in the 1980s and \u201990s.

That\u2019s what we've been doing for 50 years. And that\u2019s why Hollywood doesn\u2019t do it.

He wanted to incorporate the same speed and power seen in films like ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla]]'', which he believed was lost somewhere within the series, stating, \"The Godzilla series had lost that kind of taste. I think that back in the '70s Godzilla movies had more power and speed. He was very fast and he was very strong. So in my Godzilla, you know, less dialogue and more action. That\u2019s more fun than watching people discuss what we should do about Godzilla. As a Godzilla fan I want to see Godzilla punching and kicking, beating up all the other monsters instead of somebody talking again, you know, discussing the operation. That's what I wanted to do is to revive that, but not in the same way, I have to update. This is the updated version of '60 & 70s, crazy, monster movies.
