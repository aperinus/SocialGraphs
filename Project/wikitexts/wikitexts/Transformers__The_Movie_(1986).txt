With Megatron gravely injured, the [[Decepticon]]s are forced to retreat, saving the Autobots. The [[Autobot]]s are hunted across the galaxy by [[Unicron]], a planet-sized Transformer intending to consume Cybertron and who transfigures Megatron to become the enslaved [[Galvatron]].\n\n[[Hasbro]]'s exclusively toy-focused agenda demanded a product refresh, to be contrived by the on-screen extermination of starring characters, at the protest of some creators of the film and TV series. The slaughter of characters, especially Optimus Prime, inadvertently upset the young audience.\n\nThe film was a box-office failure, having been released in a season crowded with hit films, and having a failing young distribution company, [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]] (DEG). Contemporary critics were generally negative, perceiving a thin plot made of blatant advertising and violent action appealing only to children while praising the cinematic quality of the animation and the voice acting. The film gained [[Cult film|cult classic]] status decades later with many home re-releases and theatrical screenings, especially coinciding with [[Michael Bay]]'s live-action series in the 2000s. Several critics greatly favor the original over the live-action films; ''[[Den of Geek]]'' remembered it as \"The Great Toy Massacre of 1986\" which \"traumatized a generation of kids with a string of startling deaths\", and as \"a milestone in animation history\".\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn [[List of stories set in a future now past|2005]], the evil [[Decepticon]]s have conquered the Autobots' home planet of Cybertron. The heroic [[Autobot]]s, operating from Cybertron's two moons, prepare a counter-offensive. Autobot leader [[Optimus Prime]] sends a shuttle to Autobot City on Earth for supplies. However, their plan is discovered by the Decepticons, who kill Ironhide, Prowl, Ratchet, Brawn and hijack the ship. In Autobot City, [[Rodimus|Hot Rod]], relaxing with [[Daniel Witwicky]] (son of [[Daniel Witwicky|Spike Witwicky]]) spots the hijacked shuttle and a deadly battle breaks out. Optimus arrives with reinforcements just as the Decepticons are near victory. Optimus defeats many of them and then engages [[Megatron]] in brutal combat, leaving both mortally wounded, forcing the Decepticons to retreat and carry their wounded Decepticons, as they get in Astrotrain and go to space.\n\nOn his deathbed, Optimus passes the [[Matrix of Leadership]] to [[Ultra Magnus]], telling him that its power will light the Autobots' darkest hour. It drops from Optimus's hands and is caught by Hot Rod, who hands it to Ultra Magnus. Optimus Prime's body loses color and dies.\n\nThe Decepticons withdraw from Autobot City within [[List of The Transformers (TV series) characters#Multi Changers|Astrotrain]]. To conserve fuel so they can make it to Cybertron, they jettison Thundercracker, Skywarp, Shrapnel, Kickback, Bombshell and Megatron who got discarded by his treacherous second-in-command [[Starscream]]. Drifting into space, the wounded Decepticons are found by [[Unicron]], a sentient planet who consumes other worlds. Unicron offers Megatron a new body in exchange for destroying the Matrix, which has the power to destroy Unicron. Megatron reluctantly agrees and is remade into [[Galvatron]], while the corpses of other jettisoned Decepticons are converted into his new troops: [[Cyclonus]], Cyclonus' Armada, Scourge, and Sweeps. Unicron also gives Galvatron a new ship.\n\nOn Cybertron, Galvatron disrupts Starscream's coronation as Decepticon leader and kills him. Unicron then consumes the moons of Cybertron including the secret bases with Autobots and Spike. Retaking command of the Decepticons, Galvatron leads his forces to seek out Ultra Magnus at the ruined Autobot City.\n\nThe surviving Autobots escape in separate shuttles, which are shot down by the Decepticons and crash on different planets. Hot Rod and [[Kup (Transformers)|Kup]] are taken prisoner by the [[Quintessons]], a clutch of tyrants who hold [[kangaroo court]]s and execute prisoners by feeding them to the Sharkticons. Hot Rod and Kup learn of Unicron from Kranix, a lone survivor of Lithone, a planet devoured by Unicron at the beginning of the film. After Kranix is executed, Hot Rod and Kup escape, aided by the Dinobots and the small Autobot [[Wheelie (Transformers)|Wheelie]], who helps them find an escape ship.\n\nThe other Autobots land on the Planet of Junk where they are attacked by the native Junkions, who then hide from Galvatron's arriving forces. Ultra Magnus secures the remaining Autobots while attempting and failing to release the power of the Matrix. He is destroyed by Galvatron who seizes the Matrix, now intent on using it to control Unicron. The Autobots befriend the local Junkions, led by Wreck-Gar, who rebuild Magnus. They are joined by the Autobots from the planet of the Quintessons. Deducing that Galvatron has the Matrix, the Autobots and Junkions (who have their own ship) fly to Cybertron. Galvatron attempts to threaten Unicron, but like Ultra Magnus, cannot activate the Matrix. In response to Galvatron's threats, Unicron transforms into a colossal robot and begins to dismember Cybertron. When Galvatron attacks him, Unicron swallows him and the Matrix whole.\n\nThe Autobots crash their spaceship outward through Unicron's eye and become disbanded while Unicron continues to battle Decepticons, Junkions, and other defenders of Cybertron. Daniel saves his father Spike from Unicron's digestive system, and the group rescue [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]], and [[Cliffjumper]]. Galvatron attempts to form an alliance with Hot Rod, but Unicron forces him to attack. Hot Rod is almost killed but, at the last second, recovers and successfully activates the Matrix, resulting in him becoming Rodimus Prime, the new Autobot leader. Rodimus tosses Galvatron into space and uses the Matrix's power to destroy Unicron, then escapes with the other Autobots. With the Decepticons in disarray from Unicron's attack, the Autobots celebrate the war's end and the retaking of their home planet while Unicron's severed head orbits Cybertron.\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n!Character\n!Voice actor\n|-\n![[Optimus Prime]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Peter Cullen]]\n|-\n!Ironhide\n|-\n![[Rodimus|Hot Rod /<br /> Rodimus Prime]]\n|[[Judd Nelson]]\n|-\n![[Ultra Magnus]]\n|[[Robert Stack]]\n|-\n![[Springer (Transformers)|Springer]]\n| rowspan=\"4\" |[[Neil Ross]]\n|-\n!Slag\n|-\n![[Bonecrusher (Transformers)|Bonecrusher]]\n|-\n![[Hook (Transformers)|Hook]]\n|-\n![[Arcee]]\n|[[Susan Blu]]\n|-\n![[Kup (Transformers)|Kup]]\n|[[Lionel Stander]]\n|-\n![[Wheelie (Transformers)|Wheelie]]\n|rowspan=\"6\"|[[Frank Welker]]\n|-\n![[Megatron]]\n|-\n![[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]]\n|-\n!Frenzy\n|-\n!Rumble\n|-\n!Junkion\n|-\n![[Blurr]]\n|[[John Moschitta Jr.]]\n|-\n![[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]]\n|[[Buster Jones]]\n|-\n![[Perceptor]]\n|[[Paul Eiding]]\n|-\n![[Grimlock]]\n|[[Gregg Berger]]\n|-\n!Swoop\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]\n|-\n![[Scrapper (Transformers)|Scrapper]]\n|-\n!Junkion\n|-\n![[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]]\n|[[Scatman Crothers]]\n|-\n![[Cliffjumper]]\n|[[Casey Kasem]]\n|-\n![[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]]\n|[[Dan Gilvezan]]\n|-\n![[Brawn (Transformers)|Brawn]]\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Corey Burton]]\n|-\n![[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]]\n|-\n!Spike Witwicky\n|-\n![[Galvatron]]\n|[[Leonard Nimoy]]\n|-\n![[Cyclonus]]\n|[[Roger C.

He said in a 2013 interview: \"To remove Optimus Prime, to physically remove Daddy from the family, that wasn't going to work. I told Hasbro and their lieutenants they would have to bring him back but they said no and had 'great things planned'. In other words, they were going to create new, more expensive toys.\"<ref name=\"Massacre\" />\n\nAccording to the screenwriters, Hasbro underestimated the extent to which Prime's death would shock the young audience. Story consultant Flint Dille said: \"We didn't know that he was an icon. It was a toy show. We just thought we were killing off the old product line to replace it with new products. [...] Kids were crying in the theaters. We heard about people leaving the movie. We were getting a lot of nasty notes about it.

Many perceived a thin but darkly violent plot appealing only to children, based on blatant advertisement, unintelligible action, and supposedly lookalike characters. The day after release, Caryn James of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the film: \"While all this action may captivate young children, the animation is not spectacular enough to dazzle adults, and the Transformers have few truly human elements to lure parents along, even when their voices are supplied by well-known actors.\"<ref name=\"nytimes1\" /> Scott Cain reported a \"packed theater\", but complained that \"as a jaundiced adult\", he irritably \"never had the slightest clue as to what was taking place\" even after consulting several excited children and the irreconcilable four-page studio synopsis. He did not care to identify the voices of famous actors and concluded that \"non-stop action is sufficient for kiddie audiences [but] I am offended that ''The Transformers'' is a 90-minute toy commercial.
