Shown internationally, mainly in art house theatres, the film is set on a fictionalized version of the [[Budapest Metro]] system.  \"Kontroll\" in Hungarian refers to the act of [[Ticket controller (transportation)|ticket inspectors]] checking to ensure a rider has paid their fare. The story revolves around the ticket inspectors, riders, and a possible killer.\n\nThe film was written and directed by [[Nimr\u00f3d Antal]] and stars [[S\u00e1ndor Cs\u00e1nyi (actor)|S\u00e1ndor Cs\u00e1nyi]], [[Zolt\u00e1n Mucsi]], and Csaba Pindroch.  The film was entered in a number of film festivals in Europe and North America.  It won the [[Chicago International Film Festival#Grand Prize: Gold Hugo|Gold Hugo Award]] at the [[Chicago International Film Festival]] and was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[2004 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4202031/year/2004.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Kontroll |access-date=2009-12-02|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>  It was also [[Hungary]]'s submission for Best Foreign Language Film for the 2004 Academy Awards.\n\n==Plot==\nBulcs\u00fa ([[S\u00e1ndor Cs\u00e1nyi (actor)|S\u00e1ndor Cs\u00e1nyi]]) is a [[ticket inspector]] on the [[Budapest Metro]]; he spends his nights sleeping on the train platforms, and hasn't left the underground ever since he started working there. His ragtag team of inspectors \u2013 consisting of the veteran Professzor ([[Zolt\u00e1n Mucsi]]), the disheveled Lecs\u00f3 (S\u00e1ndor Bad\u00e1r), neurotic [[narcolepsy|narcoleptic]] Muki (Csaba Pindroch) and dimwitted greenhorn Tibi (Zsolt Nagy) \u2013 is routinely disrespected and assaulted by the commuters, who continue to evade paying fines in a variety of ways.\n\nOne of Bulcs\u00fa's company rivals, model employee Gonz\u00f3 (Bal\u00e1zs Mih\u00e1lyfi) challenges him to a \"rail run\": after the last metro leaves a station, the two get on the tracks and try to make it to the next station on foot before the midnight maintenance carriage runs them over. Bulcs\u00fa wins the contest, barely saving Gonz\u00f3 who wets himself as a result of the run. During a routine inspection, he is enamored by a girl dressed in a bear suit called Zs\u00f3fi (Eszter Balla), the daughter of one of the veteran metro drivers, B\u00e9la ([[Lajos Kov\u00e1cs (actor)|Lajos Kov\u00e1cs]]). In another occasion, Bulcs\u00fa unsuccessfully attempts to talk to his colleague Laci (L\u00e1szl\u00f3 N\u00e1dasi) after Laci gets into an altercation with a passenger and takes him hostage; Laci exclaims he can't take it anymore and slits the passenger's throat.\n\nAfter chasing a repeat offending prankster called Bootsie (Gyalogkakukk, lit. ''[[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Road Runner]]'' in the Hungarian original; Bence M\u00e1ty\u00e1ssy), Bulcs\u00fa witnesses him being pushed on the tracks by a hooded figure, dressed in exactly the same attire as him; another incident in a long line of what people thought were apparent suicides. Because of his recurring nightmare of this figure, Bulcs\u00fa fails to apprehend the murderer, and when he's brought to questioning, he refuses to disclose details of the incident to the lead executive ([[Gy\u00f6rgy Cserhalmi]]) of the company. When the executive threatens to disclose the video footage of the incident, which only shows Bulcs\u00fa, he resigns his job. Muki later insinuates him being the murderer, citing his continual nightly absence and accusing him of having the same mental issues as Laci did; an infuriated Bulcs\u00fa almost pushes him on the tracks as well.\n\nDuring an underground [[costume party]], Bulcs\u00fa spots and follows the hooded figure and they get into an altercation, after which they start rail running similarly to the contest with Gonz\u00f3 earlier. Bulcs\u00fa manages to outrun the hooded figure and escape the train. The hooded figure never emerges from the tracks. Bulcs\u00fa then meets Zs\u00f3fi, who is now dressed as a butterfly, and the two finally emerge back to the surface.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[S\u00e1ndor Cs\u00e1nyi (actor)|S\u00e1ndor Cs\u00e1nyi]] as Bulcs\u00fa\n* [[Zolt\u00e1n Mucsi]] as Professor\n* Csaba Pindroch as Muki\n* S\u00e1ndor Bad\u00e1r as Lecs\u00f3\n*{{ill|Zsolt Nagy (actor)|lt=Zsolt Nagy|hu|Nagy Zsolt (sz\u00ednm\u0171v\u00e9sz)}} as Tibi\n* Bence M\u00e1ty\u00e1ssy as Bootsie\n* [[Gy\u0151z\u0151 Szab\u00f3]] as Shadow\n* Eszter Balla as Zs\u00f3fi\n* [[Lajos Kov\u00e1cs (actor)|Lajos Kov\u00e1cs]] as B\u00e9la\n\n==Production==\nAntal was influenced by [[Andrei Tarkovsky]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[Terry Gilliam]], [[Martin Scorsese]], and [[Takeshi Kitano]].<ref name=ffc/>\n\n==Reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 82% of  66 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 7/10.
