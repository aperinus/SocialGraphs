Pictures]] about a recently divorced couple who rekindle their romantic life while searching for [[1715 Treasure Fleet|a lost treasure]]. The film is directed by [[Andy Tennant]] and reunites the ''[[How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days]]'' stars [[Matthew McConaughey]] and [[Kate Hudson]]. It received negative reviews from critics and grossed $111 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nBen \"Finn\" Finnegan is a treasure hunter and he has been searching for the sunken Spanish [[galleon]], the ''Aurelia'', that was lost at sea with the [[1715 Treasure Fleet]] for over eight years. He and his right-hand man Ukrainian Alfonz find a fragment of dishware especially produced as part of the Queen's Dowry when his accidentally sunken ship uncovers it in the seabed.\n\nOwing [[Gangsta rap|Gangster rapper]] Bigg Bunny over $60,000, Finn is roughed up by Bigg's thugs and left for dead. He hurries, once he escapes, to the divorce hearing his wife Tess has called in Key West, but he arrives one minute too late and the divorce goes through. Right after the proceeding, Finn shows her in a sketch the unique markings on the plate fragment he found.\n\nTess refuses to get sucked back into Finn's passion again, having decided to sell their boat to resume her graduate school studies she'd abandoned for him eight years ago. When he breaks it to her that it's sunk, she knocks him out.\n\nReturning to ''The Precious Gem'', the yacht where she has been working as a steward owned by multi-millionaire Nigel Honeycutt, Tess intends to save up enough money to return to Chicago. She's desperate to leave Key West, fearing Finn will find them.\n\nMeanwhile, Finn has reconnected with Alfonz, who gives him intel on Nigel. His high-profile daughter Gemma is coming to his yacht by helicopter, so he takes a dinghy out, inadvertently saving her hat, injuring himself in the process. Taking Finn on board, the doctor who attends him recommends he stay for a few hours.\n\nThat evening, Tess is shocked that Finn is on the yacht. After dinner, she and Finn tell Nigel about the fabled ''Aurelia'', with its 40 chests of riches, the Queen's Dowry. After spending two years in Seville's Archivo de Indias, they headed back to physically search for it in Florida. And finally the plate Finn just found is a clue to the location of the treasure. They persuade Nigel and Gemma to join them and fund the search.\n\nBigg Bunny and Finn's former mentor Moe Fitch are intent on finding the treasure first. The yacht and Moe's vessel compete to find it in [[The Bahamas]]. As Finn attempts to secretly take down Moe's search grid, he discovers a sword. Tess and Finn follow the clues to an ancient church and discover a diary describing its location. They are so excited by this discovery that they celebrate by having passionate sex.\n\nA short time later, Bigg Bunny and his associates, who have been following them, take Tess hostage, assuming incorrectly that Finn is dead. Bigg Bunny forces her to aid him to seek the treasure in a [[Blowhole (geology)|blowhole]]. Tess finds it in the cave beneath, but is attacked by Cyrus, one of Bigg Bunny's associates.\n\nFinn and the Honeycutts enlist Moe to help Tess and keep the treasure from Bigg Bunny. They arrive as Bigg Bunny sends his associate Curtis the water to find out who was killed in the blowhole. Tess, Moe and Finn are able to overpower Curtis and get out of the blowhole, but Bigg Bunny kidnaps Tess again, this time on his plane. Moe then takes Curtis prisoner.\n\nGemma gets Finn to the seaplane on her [[jet ski]], and he leaps onto the plane's [[Float (nautical)|pontoon]] as it takes flight. As Bigg Bunny attempts to shoot Finn, Tess kicks Bigg Bunny out of the plane, sending him into the ocean. Tess and Finn then have to land the plane. In the end, the treasure is displayed in Moe's museum, now renamed the Fitch-Finnegan Maritime Museum and Tess and Finn are back together, and she is shown to be pregnant.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Ben \"Finn\" Finnegan\n* [[Kate Hudson]] as Tess Finnegan\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Nigel Honeycutt\n* [[Alexis Dziena]] as Gemma Honeycutt\n* [[Ray Winstone]] as Moe Fitch\n* [[Kevin Hart]] as Bigg Bunny Deenz\n* [[Ewen Bremner]] as Alfonz\n* [[Brian Hooks]] as Curtis\n* [[Malcolm-Jamal Warner]] as Cordell\n* [[Michael Mulheren]] as Eddie\n* [[Adam LeFevre]] as Gary\n* Rohan Nichol as Stefan\n* [[David Roberts (Australian actor)|David Roberts]] as Cyrus\n* Roger Sciberras as Andras\n* Dan Mewing as Pilot\n\n==Production==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2015}}\n[[Warner Bros.]] and director [[Andy Tennant]] planned to shoot the film in the [[Caribbean]], but decided on [[Queensland|Queensland, Australia]] because the hurricane season in the Caribbean was likely to stall production of the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=4577 |title=FOOL'S GOLD - Movie Production Notes...CinemaReview.com |publisher=Cinemareview.com |access-date=2015-10-08}}</ref> The [[Key West]] scenes were filmed in [[Port Douglas, Queensland|Port Douglas]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Filming also took place in [[Brisbane]], the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], [[Hamilton Island (Queensland)|Hamilton Island]], [[Lizard Island National Park|Lizard Island]], [[Airlie Beach, Queensland|Airlie Beach]], and [[Hervey Bay, Queensland|Hervey Bay]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Scenes were also filmed at [[Batt Reef]], where [[Steve Irwin]] died from a stingray barb in 2006.<ref name=stuff>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/4382734a1860.html |title=Behind-the-seas dangers in Hudson, McConaughey movie |access-date=2008-02-09 |date=2008-02-01 |publisher=[[Fairfax New Zealand]]}}</ref>\n\nInside scenes were shot on a sound stage at the Warner Bros studio facility and the actors and crew stayed in luxury homes and apartments on the Gold Coast.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} McConaughey mentioned having a [[Pythonidae|python]] in the backyard of his house in Port Douglas.
