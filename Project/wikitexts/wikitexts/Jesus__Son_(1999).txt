Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote \"one of the pleasures of [the film]...is watching a filmmaker take risks and discover new resources of style. True to her source, Ms. Maclean tells the young man's story in a looping, absent-minded manner, skittering ahead and then scrambling backward to fill in forgotten details. Her decision to string together a series of self-contained vignettes could have resulted in meandering tedium, but she manages to find a loose, improvisatory rhythm that matches Mr. Johnson's discursive riffing, and that gives her scenes a keen edge of surprise.\"<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |last1=Scott |first1=A.O. |title=FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW; Goofy and Strung Out But Charming All the Same |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/07/movies/film-festival-review-goofy-and-strung-out-but-charming-all-the-same.html |access-date=20 September 2022 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 7, 2000}}</ref> Of Billy Crudup's performance, Scott wrote he gives off a \"curious aura of innocence.
