The film features fourteen different storylines, each one by a different director, including [[Elizabeth Banks]], [[Steven Brill (director)|Steven Brill]], [[Steve Carr]], [[Rusty Cundieff]], James Duffy, [[Griffin Dunne]], Patrik Forsberg, [[James Gunn]], [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Brett Ratner]], [[Will Graham (producer)|Will Graham]], and Jonathan van Tulleken.

At that meeting, Wessler, Penotti, and Farrelly presented one short that they already had shot, starring Kate Winslet as a woman going on a blind date with a seemingly successful and handsome Hugh Jackman. \"They just looked at me and said, 'Go for it,'\" Wessler told ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''. \"It takes a lot of balls to make something that is not conventional.\" Relativity provided $6 million for the film, but no other studio would sign on. \"Other potential backers\", Farrelly revealed, \"didn't believe it could happen\u2014a movie with Kate Winslet for $6 million?\"<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\nThe film officially began [[principal photography]] in March 2010, but due to its large cast, producer/director Farrelly told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that \"This movie was made over four years, and they just had to wait for a year or two years for different actors. They would shoot for a week, and shut down for several months. Same thing with the directors. It was the type of movie you could come back to.\" Shortly before shooting, writers Parker, Stone, and the Zuckers backed out.<ref name=\"EW\">{{cite magazine |last=Schou |first=Solvej |date=October 1, 2012 |title='Movie 43' co-director Peter Farrelly praises comedic Kate Winslet, Naomi Watts |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/10/01/movie-43-peter-farrelly-kate-winslet/ |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=December 28, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe film ended up with thirteen directors and nineteen writers tied to it, each one co-writing and directing different segments of the sixteen different storylines.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ford |first=Allan |title=Movie 43 TV Spot No.3 |url=https://www.filmofilia.com/movie-43-tv-spot-no3-130141/ |website=Film O Filia |date=December 27, 2012 |access-date=December 28, 2012}}</ref> Farrelly directed the parts of the movie with Halle Berry and Kate Winslet.<ref name=\"NYPost\"/><ref name=\"EW\" /><ref name=\"HR-415196\">{{cite news |last=Ford |first=Rebecca |title=How 'Movie 43' Producers Got So Many A-List Stars for the Raunchy Comedy |date=January 25, 2013 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-movie-43-producers-got-415196/ |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date=February 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Casting and filming===\nWessler spent years recruiting actors for the film. Many turned down the project.\n\"Most agents would avoid me because they knew what I wanted to do\u2014what agent wants to book their big client in a no pay, $800-a-day, two-day shoot?\" he said. \"The truth is, I had a lot of friends who were in this movie. And if they didn't say yes, this movie wouldn't have gotten made.\" In the end, most of the actors were willing to take part because the film only required a few days of their time and often allowed them to play a character outside of their wheelhouse.<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\n[[Hugh Jackman]] was the first actor Wessler cast. He met the star at a wedding and then called him sometime later and pitched him the short. Jackman read the script and agreed to be a part of the film. \"He called me back I think 24 hours later and said, 'Yeah I wanna do this,' which I think is, quite frankly, incredibly ballsy. Because you could be made a fool of, or you could look silly, and there will be people who say, 'That's crazy; he should never have done it.'\"<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\nAfter talking to the multiple agents of [[Kate Winslet]], she eventually agreed to take part. The Winslet-Jackman sketch was shot shortly after and became the reel to attract other A-list stars.<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\n[[John Hodgman]], who plays opposite [[Justin Long]] in one sketch, signed on with no knowledge of the project. Long, Hodgman's co-star in the long-running [[Get a Mac]] series of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] commercials, asked him to do the project, and he then signed on, without still knowing too much. Hodgman said, \"I got an e-mail from Justin that said, 'I'm going to be dressing up as Robin again. Do you want to dress up as the Penguin?' And I said yes. Without even realizing cameras would be involved, or that it would be a movie.\"<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\n[[James Gunn]] revealed during a [[Facebook]] Q&A that he was convinced to do the film by [[Elizabeth Banks]] and to \"blame her\" for it. He added, \"I didn't even get to edit that stupid thing!\" He also has never seen the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/jgunn/videos/10154923971416157/|title=Hi everyone.

In fact, some stars hedged: [[Richard Gere]], a friend of Wessler's, said yes\u2014but also said he would not be available for more than a year. So Wessler waited him out, convinced his sketch was good. Gere eventually called Wessler and told him he was free to shoot, on just a couple of conditions: they had to do it in four days, and they needed to relocate the shoot from [[Los Angeles]] to [[New York City]].<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\n\"They clearly wanted out!\" judged Farrelly. \"But we wouldn't let them. The strategy was simple: 'Wait for them. Shoot when they want to shoot. Guilt them to death.' It didn't work on everyone.\" [[Colin Farrell]] initially agreed to be in the Butler leprechaun sketch\u2014as Butler's brother, also a leprechaun\u2014but then he backed out and [[Gerard Butler]] did the sketch by himself. Farrelly said that when he approached [[George Clooney]] about playing himself in a sketch (the gag was that Clooney is bad at picking up women), Clooney told him \"No fucking way.\"<ref name=\"NYPost\"/> There were two sketches cut from the film that were originally shown during a [[test screening]]; one that starred [[Anton Yelchin]] as a [[necrophilia]]c mortician who worked at a hospital and had sex with the dead female bodies, and another starring [[Julianne Moore]] and [[Tony Shalhoub]] as a married couple being interviewed by a [[detective]] about their missing daughter.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1333125/board/thread/209996584?d=209996855&p=1#209996855 |title=Re: Who Directed what Skits? |website=IMDb}}</ref> Producer Penotti said that the sketches would be seen on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases of the film,<ref name=\"NYPost\"/> however only the latter was included in the release.<ref name=\"comicmix.com\"/>\n\nBecause the filmmakers worked around the stars' schedules, the filming of the whole movie took several years. While so many A-list actors were on board, most were not completely aware of what other sketches would be included in the film, which features thirteen vignettes tied together by a story of a mad screenwriter (Quaid) pitching ideas to a movie producer (Kinnear). Penotti said many of the actors did not ask many questions about what else was going on in the film.\n\"They were attracted to their script, and as long as that tickled their funnybone, that was enough,\" he revealed.<ref name=\"NYPost\"/><ref name=\"HR-415196\"/>\n\n==Promotion==\nThe title of the film, ''Movie 43'' has no meaning. Farrelly heard his son talking with friends about a film called \"Movie 43\", but when Farrelly discovered the film did not exist, he cribbed the name.<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\nRelativity did little to promote the film and none of the cast members did any promotion of the film. The film was not screened for critics in advance. \"The slapdash title, the lack of promotion and advance screenings, the release date\u2014none of it bodes well,\" opined ''Entertainment Weekly'' senior editor Thom Geier. \"January is usually where movies go to die,\" Geier argued. \"And to go by the trailer\u2014the only option\u2014the content seems dated.\" A [[Trailer (promotion)#Rating cards|red-band trailer]] was released on October 3, 2012.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Stillman |first=Josh |title=''Movie 43'' trailer: Kate Winslet, Naomi Watts, and Emma Stone get their NSFW on |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/10/03/movie-43-trailer-kate-winslet-naomi-watts-and-emma-stone/ |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=October 3, 2012 |date=October 3, 2012}}</ref> Farrelly was optimistic: \"Kids, teenagers, 50-somethings who still smoke pot\u2014they're all going to find something here,\" he asserted.<ref name=\"NYPost\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''Movie 43'' was panned by critics, with some considering it to be [[List of films considered the worst|one of the worst films ever made]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/29/movie-43-peter-farrelly-twitter |title=Movie 43 director tells critics to 'lighten up' after film bombs at box office |last=Child |first=Ben |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=January 29, 2013 |access-date=February 14, 2016}}</ref> The film received a [[weighted average]] score of 18 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 23 critics, signifying \"overwhelming dislike\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/movie-43 |title=Movie 43 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |access-date=May 9, 2019}}</ref> On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 4% positive rating based on 89 reviews, with an average rating of 2.74/10.
