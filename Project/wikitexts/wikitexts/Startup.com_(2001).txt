[[D.A. Pennebaker]] served as a producer on the film. It follows the [[dot-com company|dot-com start-up]] govWorks.com, which raised $60 million in funding from [[Hearst Communications|Hearst Interactive Media]], [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts|KKR]], the New York Investment Fund, and [[Sapient Corporation|Sapient]].\n\nThe startup did not survive, but it became a reference for lessons learned, as it was the subject of a 2001 documentary that follows [[govWorks]] founders [[Kaleil Isaza Tuzman]] and Tom Herman from 1999 to 2000, as the [[dot-com bubble|Internet bubble]] was bursting.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 21, 2001. It was released on May 11, 2001, by [[Artisan Entertainment]].\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced by [[D.A. Pennebaker]], and directed by [[Chris Hegedus]] and [[Jehane Noujaim]].  Noujaim had been Kaleil Tuzman's [[Harvard University|Harvard]] classmate and began filming Tuzman as he quit his job at [[Goldman Sachs]], to begin govWorks with his high school friend Tom Herman. Noujaim contacted Hegedus and Pennebaker for help in financing the project. The film was distributed by [[Artisan Entertainment]] (which was later acquired by [[Lions Gate Entertainment]]).\n\nThe film was shot in digital video.  The filmmakers shot for over two years, and were editing the more than 400 hours of video and film right up to their [[Sundance Film Festival]] premiere in early 2001. They re-edited the last few minutes of the film just prior to its May 2001 theatrical release.\n\nSince the film's release, Herman and Tuzman worked together again at Recognition Group and [[JumpTV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicdatasystems.com/govworks |website=Tom Herman Adventures in Entrepreneurship|title=govWorks Executive Summary}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kitcapital.com/about_us.php?sub=2 |website=Recognition Group/KIT |title=Capital team biographies}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''Startup.com'' received positive reviews from film critics.
