The film also features [[Derek Jacobi]] as [[King Claudius]], [[Julie Christie]] as [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Queen Gertrude]], [[Kate Winslet]] as [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]], [[Michael Maloney]] as [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]], [[Richard Briers]] as [[Polonius]], and [[Nicholas Farrell]] as [[Horatio (character)|Horatio]]. Other cast members include [[Robin Williams]], [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]], [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Billy Crystal]], [[Rufus Sewell]], [[Charlton Heston]], [[Richard Attenborough]], [[Judi Dench]], [[John Gielgud]] and [[Ken Dodd]].\n\nThe film is the first unabridged theatrical film version of ''Hamlet'', running just over four hours. The setting is updated to the 19th century, but its [[Elizabethan English]] text remains the same. [[Blenheim Palace]] is the setting used for the exterior grounds of Elsinore Castle and interiors were all photographed at [[Shepperton Studios]], blended with the footage shot at Blenheim. ''Hamlet'' was also the last major dramatic motion picture to be filmed entirely on [[70 mm film]] until 2011, with the release of the documentary ''[[Samsara (2011 film)|Samsara]]''.\n\n''Hamlet'' has been regarded as one of the best Shakespeare film adaptations ever made.<ref name=\"Rotten Tomatoes\" /><ref name=\"Roger Ebert\" /><ref name=\"ReelViews\" /><ref name=\"Greatest Shakespeare\" /> However, it was not a box office success, mostly due to its limited release, grossing just under $5 million on a budget of $18 million.<ref name=\"Box Office Mojo\" /> The film received four [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations for the [[69th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] ([[Tim Harvey (film designer)|Tim Harvey]]), [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] ([[Alexandra Byrne]]), [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] ([[Patrick Doyle]]), and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)]] (Kenneth Branagh).\n\n==Plot==\n\n[[Prince Hamlet]] of Denmark, is the son of the recently deceased [[King Hamlet]], and nephew of [[King Claudius]], his father's brother and successor. Claudius hastily married King Hamlet's widow, Gertrude, Hamlet's mother, and took the throne for himself. Denmark has a long-standing feud with neighbouring [[Norway]], in which King Hamlet slew King Fortinbras of Norway in a battle some years ago. Although Denmark defeated Norway and the Norwegian throne fell to King Fortinbras's infirm brother, Denmark fears that an invasion led by the dead Norwegian king's son, Prince [[Fortinbras]], is imminent.\n\nOn a cold night on the ramparts of [[Kronborg Slot|Elsinore]], the Danish royal castle, the [[Characters in Hamlet#Elsinore sentries|sentries]] Bernardo and Marcellus discuss a [[Ghost (Hamlet)|ghost]] resembling the late King Hamlet which they have recently seen, and bring Prince Hamlet's friend [[Horatio (Hamlet)|Horatio]] as a witness. After the ghost appears again, the three vow to tell Prince Hamlet what they have witnessed.\n\nAs the court gathers the next day, while King Claudius and Queen Gertrude discuss affairs of state with their elderly adviser [[Polonius]], Hamlet looks on glumly. During the court, Claudius grants permission for Polonius's son Laertes to return to school in France and sends envoys to inform the King of Norway about Fortinbras. Claudius also scolds Hamlet for continuing to grieve over his father and forbids him to return to his schooling in [[Wittenberg]]. After the court exits, Hamlet despairs of his father's death and his mother's hasty remarriage. Learning of the ghost from Horatio, Hamlet resolves to see it himself.\n\nAs Polonius's son Laertes prepares to depart for a visit to France, Polonius offers him advice that culminates in the maxim \"to thine own self be true.\"{{sfn|Trilling|2009|p=8}} Polonius's daughter, [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]], admits her interest in Hamlet, but Laertes warns her against seeking the prince's attention, and Polonius orders her to reject his advances. That night on the rampart, the ghost appears to Hamlet, telling the prince that he was murdered by Claudius and demanding that Hamlet avenge him. Hamlet agrees, and the ghost vanishes. The prince confides to Horatio and the sentries that from now on he plans to \"put an antic disposition on\", or act as though he has gone mad, and forces them to swear to keep his plans for revenge secret; however, he remains uncertain of the ghost's reliability.\n\nSoon thereafter, Ophelia rushes to her father, telling him that Hamlet arrived at her door the prior night half-undressed and behaving erratically. Polonius blames love for Hamlet's madness and resolves to inform Claudius and Gertrude. As he enters to do so, the King and Queen finish welcoming [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]], two student acquaintances of Hamlet, to Elsinore. The royal couple has requested that the students investigate the cause of Hamlet's mood and behaviour. Additional news requires that Polonius wait to be heard: messengers from Norway inform Claudius that the King of Norway has rebuked Prince Fortinbras for attempting to re-fight his father's battles. The forces that Fortinbras had conscripted to march against Denmark will instead be sent against [[Poland]], though they will pass through Danish territory to get there.\n\nPolonius tells Claudius and Gertrude his theory regarding Hamlet's behaviour and speaks to Hamlet in a hall of the castle to try to uncover more information. Hamlet feigns madness and subtly insults Polonius all the while. When Rosencrantz and Guildenstern arrive, Hamlet greets his \"friends\" warmly but quickly discerns that they are spies. Hamlet admits that he is upset at his situation but refuses to give the true reason, instead of commenting on \"[[What a piece of work is a man]]\". Rosencrantz and Guildenstern tell Hamlet that they have brought along a troupe of actors that they met while travelling to Elsinore. Hamlet, after welcoming the actors and dismissing his friends-turned-spies, asks them to deliver a soliloquy about the death of [[Priam|King Priam]] and [[Hecuba|Queen Hecuba]] at the climax of the [[Trojan War]]. Impressed by their delivery of the speech, he plots to stage ''The Murder of Gonzago'', a play featuring a death in the style of his father's murder, and to determine the truth of the ghost's story, as well as Claudius's guilt or innocence, by studying Claudius's reaction.\n\nPolonius forces Ophelia to return Hamlet's love letters and tokens of affection to the prince while he and Claudius watch from afar to evaluate Hamlet's reaction. Hamlet is walking alone in the hall as the King and Polonius await Ophelia's entrance, musing whether \"[[To be, or not to be|to be or not to be]]\". When Ophelia enters and tries to return Hamlet's things, Hamlet accuses her of immodesty and cries \"get thee to a nunnery\", though it is unclear whether this, too, is a show of madness or genuine distress. His reaction convinces Claudius that Hamlet is not mad for love. Shortly thereafter, the court assembles to watch the play Hamlet has commissioned. After seeing the [[Characters in Hamlet#The Players|Player King]] murdered by his rival pouring poison in his ear, Claudius abruptly rises and runs from the room; for Hamlet, this is proof positive of his uncle's guilt.\n\nGertrude summons Hamlet to her chamber to demand an explanation. Meanwhile, Claudius talks to himself about the impossibility of repenting, since he still has possession of his ill-gotten goods: his brother's crown and wife. He sinks to his knees. On his way to visit his mother, Hamlet sneaks up behind him but does not kill him, reasoning that killing Claudius while he is praying will send him straight to heaven while his father's ghost is stuck in purgatory. In the queen's bedchamber, Hamlet and Gertrude fight bitterly. Polonius, spying on the conversation from behind a [[tapestry]], calls for help as Gertrude, believing Hamlet wants to kill her, calls out for help herself.\n\nHamlet, believing it is Claudius, stabs wildly, killing Polonius, but he pulls aside the curtain and sees his mistake. In a rage, Hamlet brutally insults his mother for her apparent ignorance of Claudius's villainy, but the ghost enters and reprimands Hamlet for his inaction and harsh words. Unable to see or hear the ghost herself, Gertrude takes Hamlet's conversation with it as further evidence of madness. After begging the queen to stop sleeping with Claudius, Hamlet leaves, dragging Polonius's corpse away.\n\nHamlet jokes with Claudius about where he has hidden Polonius's body, and the King, fearing for his life, sends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to accompany Hamlet to [[England]] with a sealed letter to the King of England requesting that Hamlet be executed immediately.\n\nUnhinged by grief at Polonius's death, Ophelia wanders Elsinore. Laertes arrives back from France, enraged by his father's death and his sister's madness. Claudius convinces Laertes that Hamlet is solely responsible, but a letter soon arrives indicating that Hamlet has returned to Denmark, foiling Claudius's plan. Claudius switches tactics, proposing a fencing match between Laertes and Hamlet to settle their differences. Laertes will be given a poison-tipped foil, and, if that fails, Claudius will offer Hamlet poisoned wine as a congratulation. Gertrude interrupts to report that Ophelia has drowned, though it is unclear whether it was suicide or an accident caused by her madness.\n\nHoratio has received a letter from Hamlet, explaining that the prince escaped by negotiating with pirates who attempted to attack his England-bound ship, and the friends reunite offstage. Two [[Characters in Hamlet#Ophelia's funeral|gravediggers]] discuss Ophelia's apparent suicide while digging her grave. Hamlet arrives with Horatio and banters with one of the gravediggers, who unearths the skull of a [[jester]] from Hamlet's childhood, [[Yorick (Hamlet)|Yorick]]. Hamlet picks up the skull, saying \"alas, poor Yorick\" as he contemplates mortality. Ophelia's [[funeral procession]] approaches, led by Laertes. Hamlet and Horatio initially hide, but when Hamlet realizes that Ophelia is the one being buried, he reveals himself, proclaiming his love for her. Laertes and Hamlet fight by Ophelia's graveside, but the brawl is broken up.\n\nBack at Elsinore, Hamlet explains to Horatio that he had discovered Claudius's letter with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's belongings and replaced it with a forged copy indicating that his former friends should be killed instead. A foppish courtier, [[Characters in Hamlet#Osric|Osric]], interrupts the conversation to deliver the fencing challenge to Hamlet. Hamlet, despite Horatio's pleas, accepts it. Hamlet does well at first, leading the match by two hits to none, and Gertrude raises a toast to him using the poisoned glass of wine Claudius had set aside for Hamlet. Claudius tries to stop her but is too late: she drinks, and Laertes realizes the plot will be revealed. Laertes slashes Hamlet with his poisoned blade. In the ensuing scuffle, they switch weapons, and Hamlet wounds Laertes with his own poisoned sword. Gertrude collapses and, claiming she has been poisoned, dies. In his dying moments, Laertes reconciles with Hamlet and reveals Claudius's plan. Hamlet rushes at Claudius and kills him. As the poison takes effect, Hamlet, hearing that Fortinbras is marching through the area, names the Norwegian prince as his successor. Horatio, distraught at the thought of being the last survivor and living whilst Hamlet does not, says he will commit [[suicide]] by drinking the dregs of Gertrude's poisoned wine, but Hamlet begs him to live on and tell his story. Hamlet dies in Horatio's arms, proclaiming \"the rest is silence\". Fortinbras, who was ostensibly marching towards Poland with his army, arrives at the palace, along with an English ambassador bringing news of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's deaths. Horatio promises to recount the full story of what happened, and Fortinbras, seeing the entire Danish royal family dead, takes the crown for himself and orders a military funeral to honour Prince Hamlet.\nThis is done and the film ends on an image of a statue of King Hamlet being demolished.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Main characters===\n*[[Kenneth Branagh]] as [[Prince Hamlet]], the story's protagonist and Prince of Denmark. He is the son of the late King Hamlet and heir to the throne of Denmark. At first, Hamlet is depressed over his father's death and angered his mother Gertrude's swift remarriage to his uncle Claudius. However, Hamlet is later told by the ghost of his father that Claudius murdered him, usurping his throne. Hamlet swears to avenge his father's murder. Branagh described his interpretation of the title role as considerably less \"neurotic\" than others, removing the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal fixation]] prominently featured in [[Laurence Olivier]]'s [[Hamlet (1948 film)|1948 film adaptation]], among others. During the scenes in which Hamlet pretends to be insane, Branagh portrayed the Prince as [[Mania|manic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hamlet-1996 |title=Hamlet: Review |author=Roger Ebert |date=24 January 1997}}</ref>\n*[[Derek Jacobi]] as [[King Claudius]], the play's antagonist and brother of the late king. He murders his brother by pouring poison into his ear while he sleeps. He then usurps his brother's title and marries his widow. At first, believing Hamlet to have been driven mad by the loss of his father, Claudius tries to spy on Hamlet. When Claudius later learns Hamlet knows of the murder, he tries to use [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]], two of Hamlet's schoolmates, to have his nephew murdered. Jacobi appeared in the title role in the BBC's [[Hamlet (1980 film)|1980 made-for-television version of ''Hamlet'']].\n*[[Julie Christie]] as [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]], Queen of Denmark and wife to both the late King Hamlet and King Claudius, whom she married swiftly following the former's passing\u2014ignorant of the foul play that caused his death.\n*[[Richard Briers]] as [[Polonius]], the Lord Chamberlain. An impertinent busy-body, Polonius believes Hamlet to be mad and convinces Claudius to join him in spying on the prince. Hamlet eventually kills him, believing him to be Claudius. \n*[[Kate Winslet]] as [[Ophelia]], noblewoman of Denmark and daughter of Polonius. Ophelia is in love with Hamlet, until advised by her father Polonius and brother [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]] to end their relationship. She is eventually driven mad by both Hamlet's rejection and her father's murder and drowns herself.\n*[[Nicholas Farrell]] as [[Horatio (character)|Horatio]], a good friend of Hamlet whom he met while attending [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|Wittenberg University]].\n*[[Michael Maloney]] as [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]], the son of Polonius and brother of Ophelia. After instructing his sister to have no further relations with Hamlet, he departs for Paris. Upon news of his father's murder, Laertes returns to Denmark, leading a mob to storm the castle. Claudius incites Laertes to kill Hamlet and avenge Polonius's death. He later conspires with Claudius to murder Hamlet during a fencing duel.\n*[[Rufus Sewell]] as [[Fortinbras]], the Norwegian crown prince. Played mostly in flashback and frequently referenced throughout the film, Fortinbras storms Elsinore castle with his army during the final scene, and assumes the vacant throne of Denmark.\n\n===Supporting characters===\n*[[Robin Williams]] as [[Characters in Hamlet#Osric|Osric]], the Elsinore courtier sent by Claudius to invite Hamlet to participate in the duel with Laertes.\n*[[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as Reynaldo, a servant to Polonius. He is sent by Polonius to Paris to check up on Laertes.\n*[[Timothy Spall]] as [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern|Rosencrantz]] and [[Reece Dinsdale]] as [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern|Guildenstern]], courtier friends of Hamlet who are sent by Claudius to spy on Hamlet.\n*[[Jack Lemmon]] as Marcellus and [[Ian McElhinney]] as Bernardo, sentries at Elsinore who alert Horatio of the appearance of King Hamlet's Ghost.\n*[[Ray Fearon]] as Francisco, a sentry at Elsinore and the first character to appear on screen.\n*[[Brian Blessed]] as the [[Ghost (Hamlet)|Ghost of Hamlet's Father]], an apparition in the form of the late King who informs Hamlet of his murder and Claudius's usurpation of the throne.\n*[[Billy Crystal]] as the [[The Gravediggers|First Gravedigger]], a sexton digging Ophelia's grave who makes a case as to why she should not receive Christian burial before making quick dialogue with Hamlet. He later presents the skull of [[Yorick]] to Hamlet, not knowing of Hamlet's history with the jester.\n*[[Simon Russell Beale]] as the [[The Gravediggers|Second Gravedigger]]\n*[[Don Warrington]] as Voltimand, an ambassador sent by King Claudius to Old King Norway.\n*[[Ravil Isyanov]] as Cornelius, an ambassador sent by King Claudius to Old King Norway.\n*[[Charlton Heston]] as the Player King\n*[[Rosemary Harris]] as the Player Queen\n*[[Richard Attenborough]] as the English Ambassador\n*[[John Gielgud]] as [[Priam]], the King of [[Troy]], played in flashback during the Player King's speech.\n*[[Judi Dench]] as [[Hecuba]], the Queen of Troy and wife of Priam, played in flashback during the Player King's speech.\n*[[John Mills]] as Old King Norway, uncle of Fortinbras, played in flashback reprimanding his nephew for claims against Denmark.\n*[[Ken Dodd]] as [[Yorick]], the King's Jester, played in flashback entertaining the royals of Elsinore during the gravediggers scene.\n*[[John Spencer-Churchill, 11th Duke of Marlborough]], appears in a small cameo scene as the Norwegian Captain.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Origins===\nAspects of the film's staging are based on [[Adrian Noble]]'s recent [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] production of the play, in which Branagh had played the title role.<ref>{{cite book|first=Samuel|last=Crowl|chapter=Flamboyant Realist: Kenneth Branagh|editor-first=Russell|editor-last=Jackson|title=The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Film|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani00jack_577|url-access=limited|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge, England|date=2000|isbn=978-0521866002|page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani00jack_577/page/n240 225]}}</ref>\n\n===Text===\nThe film uses a conflated text based on the 1623 [[First Folio]], with additions from the [[Second Quarto]] and amendments from other sources. According to a note appended to the published screenplay:\n\n{{blockquote|The screenplay is based on the text of ''Hamlet'' as it appears in the First Folio \u2013 the edition of Shakespeare's plays collected by his theatrical associates Heminges and Condell and published in 1623 by a syndicate of booksellers. Nothing has been cut from this text, and some passages absent from it (including the soliloquy \"How all occasions do inform against me ...\") have been supplied from the Second Quarto (an edition of the play which exists in copies dated 1604 and 1605). We have also incorporated some readings of words and phrases from this source and from other early printed texts, and in a few cases emendations from modern editors of the play. Thus in I, 4, in the passage (from the Second Quarto) about the \"dram of eale\", we use an emendation from the Oxford edition of the ''Complete Works'' (edited by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor, 1988): \"doth all the noble substance ''over-daub''\" \u2013 rather than the original's \"of a doubt\".<ref>Branagh, Kenneth (1996), ''\"Hamlet\" by William Shakespeare: Screenplay and Introduction by Kenneth Branagh; production diary by Russell Jackson'' (New York: W W Norton), p.174.  {{ISBN|0393045196}}</ref>}}\n\n===Style===\nDespite using a full text, Branagh's film is also very visual; it makes frequent use of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] to depict scenes that are either only described but not performed in Shakespeare's text, such as Hamlet's childhood friendship with Yorick, or scenes only implied by the play's text, such as Hamlet's sexual relationship with [[Kate Winslet]]'s Ophelia.<ref>Keyishian, p.79</ref> The film also uses very [[long take|long single takes]] for numerous scenes.\n\nIn a radical departure from previous ''Hamlet'' films, Branagh set the internal scenes in a vibrantly colourful setting, featuring a throne room dominated by mirrored doors; film scholar Samuel Crowl calls the setting \"''film noir'' with all the lights on\".<ref>Crowl, p.227</ref> Branagh chose [[Victorian era]] costuming and furnishings, using [[Blenheim Palace]], built in the early 18th century, as Elsinore Castle for the external scenes. Harry Keyishan has suggested that the film is structured as an [[Epic film|epic]], courting comparison with ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' and ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]''.<ref>Keyishian, p.78</ref> As J. Lawrence Guntner points out, comparisons with the latter film are heightened by the presence of [[Julie Christie]] (''Zhivago''{{'s}} Lara) as Gertrude.<ref>Guntner, pp.122\u2013123.</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n''Hamlet'' was shot in [[Super Panavision 70|Panavision Super 70]] by [[Alex Thomson (cinematographer)|Alex Thomson]].

Doyle composed three primary themes for the film to accompany the characters of Ophelia, Claudius, and Hamlet, which are varied throughout the score. The \"simple, childlike\" theme for Ophelia is mostly string-dominant, often performed by a [[string quartet]] yet occasionally accompanied by a full string ensemble or mixed chorus. For Claudius, Doyle composed a theme in the form of a demented [[Canon (music)|canon]], using more 20th century harmonies. The theme for Hamlet was considered by Doyle to be \"the most daunting and elusive\" to conceive, before settling upon a more \"simple\" motif to accompany the contemplative character.<ref name=\"Filmtracks\">[http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/hamlet.html ''Hamlet'' (1996): (Patrick Doyle)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208204035/http://filmtracks.com/titles/hamlet.html |date=8 February 2012 }}.
