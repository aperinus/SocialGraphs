The film stars Sandler, [[Jennifer Hudson]], [[Kevin James]], [[Terry Crews]], [[Rob Schneider]], [[Colin Quinn]], [[Nick Swardson]], [[Lamorne Morris]] and [[Arsenio Hall]], and follows a [[talent manager]] in 1990s [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]. The film was released on [[Netflix]] on April 14, 2017.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1994, Sandy Wexler is a talent manager working in Los Angeles. He has a reputation for having an extremely eccentric personality and for often telling huge lies to sound more important than he really is, resulting in his clients never finding success except for his first, a man named Alfred. His current clientele include Ted Rafferty, a [[ventriloquist]], Kevin Conners, a comedian, Amy Baskin, an actress, Gary Rogers, a [[Stunt performer|daredevil]], and Bobby Barnes, a wrestler.\n\nWhile at [[Six Flags]], Sandy sees a young woman, Courtney Clarke, performing in a stage show. Immediately entranced by both her voice and her beauty, he convinces her that he can make her a star. She records several singles that become hits, but his antics continue to cause her trouble. Eventually, her boyfriend, rapper Bling, convinces Sandy that his presence is a hindrance to Courtney's potential fame and he resigns as her manager.\n\nWhile Sandy continues to struggle with both his feelings for Courtney and his clients, Courtney grows more and more famous, eventually winning a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]. Bobby soon sees success when Sandy helps him become champ, while Courtney, feeling unsatisfied with her fame, spirals into drinking and a string of failed relationships. She seeks comfort with Sandy, but their one night stand goes nowhere. She eventually tells him that she's quitting the business and leaving to get married.\n\nDepressed by Courtney's decision, Sandy acts out worse than ever, which costs him all his clients except Ted. While back at Six Flags, he meets Alfred, finally revealed to be [[Weird Al Yankovic]]. Al convinces Sandy to stop telling people what he thinks they want to hear and, instead, tell them the truth. To this end, he has his landlord bring Courtney to Griffith Observatory, where he admits his feelings to her, which she reciprocates, and they're married in a ceremony officiated by one of Ted's puppets.\n\nSandy's newfound honesty also gets him back his clients as well as many new ones. After twenty years, Courtney and Sandy are married for real.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Sandy Wexler<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kevin-james-terry-crews-rob-913578 |title=Kevin James, Terry Crews, Rob Schneider Join Adam Sandler's 'Sandy Wexler' (Exclusive) |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |date=2016-07-26 |access-date=2016-11-11}}</ref>\n* [[Jennifer Hudson]] as Courtney Clarke<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/>\n* [[Kevin James]] as Ted Rafferty<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/>\n* [[Terry Crews]] as \"Bedtime\" Bobby Barnes<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/>\n* [[Shad Gaspard]] as \"Bedtime\" Bobby Barnes (in-ring)\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as Firuz<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/>\t\t\n* [[Colin Quinn]] as Kevin Connors<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/>\n* [[Nick Swardson]] as Gary Rodgers<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/>\n* [[Lamorne Morris]] as Bling<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/>\t\n* [[Arsenio Hall]] as himself<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/>\n* [[Aaron Neville]] as Willy Clarke\n* [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] as Cindy Marvelle<ref name=\"slashfilm\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/sandy-wexler-teaser-trailer|title='Sandy Wexler' Teaser Trailer: Adam Sandler Actually Ruins a Movie|publisher=slashfilm|date=2017-01-19|access-date=2017-01-31}}</ref>\n* Sandy Wernick as Peter Marvelle\n* [[Wayne Federman]] as Eric Lamonsoff<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/>\n* Jackie Sandler as Amy Baskin\n* [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]] as Oscar\n* [[Rob Reiner]] as Marty Markowitz\n* [[Chris Elliott]] as Mr. Buttons\n* [[Ido Mosseri]] as Yuri\n* [[Milo Ventimiglia]] as Barry Bubatzi\n* [[Eugenio Derbez]] as Ramiro Alejandro\n* Jessica Lowe as Ms. Gideon\n* [[Allen Covert]] as Gurvy\n* [[Jonathan Loughran]] as Trucker Jon\n* [[Kate Micucci]] as Nurse Trisha\n* [[Jared Sandler]] as Jared\n\nCameo roles include [[Clay Aiken]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], [[Darius Rucker]], [[Jason Priestley]], [[Gary Dell'Abate]], [[Arsenio Hall]], [[Quincy Jones]], [[Judd Apatow]], [[Janeane Garofalo]], [[Pauly Shore]], [[Kevin Nealon]], [[Lorne Michaels]], [[Dana Carvey]], [[Chris Rock]], [[David Spade]], [[George Wendt]], [[Penn Jillette]], [[Henry Winkler]], [[Tony Orlando]], [[Al B.
