The supporting cast includes [[Edgar Buchanan]], [[James Drury]], [[Warren Oates]], and Ron Starr. The film's script, though credited solely to veteran TV screenwriter N. B. Stone Jr.,<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=ridethehighcountry.htm Box Office Mojo]</ref> was \u2013 according to producer Richard E. Lyons \u2013 almost entirely the work of Stone's friend and colleague, [[William Roberts (screenwriter)|William S. Roberts]], and Peckinpah himself.<ref>Compo, Susan (2009).

The 145-page draft eventually obtained from Stone was, in Lyon's word, \"awful.\" Apprised of the situation, Roberts offered to do a full rewrite, though he insisted on remaining uncredited, still hoping to give his friend's career a boost. The rewrite was completed, and though deemed an enormous improvement, it remained, in Lyon's words, \"a diamond in the rough.\" Thankfully, Peckinpah \"knew how to cut it to really bring out its brilliance\":<blockquote>What Sam did was a tremendous three-to-four-week dialogue rewrite. And he made possibly the single most important structural change. In the original Stone-Roberts script, Randy, the 'black hat' character, dies at the end. Sam switched it so the good guy died. And that, I think, really gave the film its tremendous impact, because it went against the tradition of the bad guy paying his debt.<ref name=GS44>Simmons, Garner (1982).

Six miners were recently murdered trying to transport their gold on the one trail leading down from the crest of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. In his prime, Judd was a tough and respected lawman, but now his threadbare clothes and spectacles serve as reminders that he is long past his prime. Judd enlists the help of his old friend and partner Gil Westrum to guard the gold transfer. Gil, who had been making his living passing himself off as a legendary sharpshooter named The Oregon Kid, enlists the help of his young sidekick, Heck Longtree.\n\nJudd, Gil and Heck hit the trail on horseback toward Coarsegold, a mining camp located in the Sierra foothills, north of the town of Fresno. Judd doesn't realize that Gil and Heck are planning to steal the gold for themselves \u2014 preferably with Judd's help, but without it if necessary. Along the way they stop for the night at the farm of Joshua Knudsen and his daughter Elsa. Knudsen is a domineering religious man who warns against those who \"traffic in gold\" and trades Bible verses with Judd at the dinner table. That night, Elsa and Heck secretly meet in the moonlight for conversation, but the elder Knudsen catches them and pulls her away. Back at the house, he admonishes and slaps her; even though her father had only met Heck that evening, \"I can see that the boy is no good\"- just as all her other boyfriends were no good. Elsa replies \"I promised the next time you hit me you'd be sorry for it!\"\n\nThe next morning, after the three men had left on the trail to the mining camp, she catches up to them and asks whether she can keep them company on the way. She announces that she is also going to Coarsegold, to marry a miner named Billy Hammond. He had previously proposed to her when he was in town, although she had not accepted his proposal back then. Along the way, Elsa and Heck flirt, and at one time he tries to force himself on her. Heck is stopped by Judd, and then punched by both Judd and Gil. He later apologizes to Elsa.\n\nWhen they reach the mining camp, the two older men set up a tent to weigh and accept gold dust in individual bags for which they give receipts of deposit, with safe transport guaranteed by the bank.\n\nHaving brought her mother's wedding dress with her, Elsa and Billy are married in the camp's brothel{{--}}the only substantial building there{{--}}by a real retired judge who happens to be at the camp. The madam and prostitutes serve as \"maid of honor\" and \"flower girls\".  Then Billy forces Elsa to a room in the brothel for their wedding night even though she emphatically states \"No, Billy, not here!\";  he strikes her when she refuses to obey him. By now intoxicated and passed out, he fails to prevent his disreputable brothers Elder, Sylvus, Jimmy, and Henry from entering the room and attempting to rape her.\n\nOutside, hearing her screams, Judd and Heck rescue Elsa from the brothel and the Hammonds and let her stay in their tent that night.\n\nThe next day, the miners of the camp organize a \"miner's trial\" (without any need for a judge) to force the outsiders to return Elsa to her \"legal\" husband; because they are outnumbered, former lawman Judd agrees to the miner's demands as \"that's the law in places like this\".  However, Gill wakes up the drunken judge and demands to see his license (which in fact is duly issued in Sacramento), and then keeps it. He forces the judge at gunpoint to agree that when asked if the judge has a license to marry, he must say no (because Gill has it).\n\nThis ruse works and the three men are allowed to leave the camp with the gold and Elsa.\n\nAlong the way, Judd talks to Gil about right and wrong and how that's \"something you just know\". After all the lost years working in disreputable places, he tells Gil that he's now grateful to have gained back some of his self-respect and intends on keeping it \"with the help of you and that boy back there\". When Gil asks if that's all he wants, Judd replies, \"All I want is to enter my House justified.\"\n\nRealizing Judd will never go along with his plan to steal the gold, Gil plans to take the gold without his help. During the night as Gil and Heck prepare to leave with the gold, Judd confronts them at gunpoint. Heck, after previously expressing a change of mind to Gil, gives up his gun immediately. Angered by his old friend's Gil's betrayal, Judd puts his gun away, then slaps Gil and challenges him to draw. Instead, Gil throws down his guns and accepts that Judd will turn him in when they return to town.\n\nJudd is forced to change his plans when the Hammond brothers appear in hot pursuit of Elsa. They found out about the ruse and learned that the judge's license could be verified in Sacramento, proving the marriage legal.\n\nIn the ensuing gunfight, two of the brothers, Jimmy and Sylvus, are killed, and Billy, Elder and Henry give up and escape.\n\nDuring the night, Gil leaves camp and heads back to the site of the gunfight, where he takes a horse and gun from one of the dead brothers. Then he follows Judd, Heck, and Elsa down the only trail. Meanwhile, Heck has shown himself to be trustworthy, and even though he will most likely go to prison, Elsa tells him she'll be there when he gets out. When they reach Elsa's farm, the Hammond brothers are waiting, having already killed her father. A gunfight breaks out and soon both Judd and Heck are wounded. Gil comes riding in to help his old friend, and together the pair insult and challenge the brothers to a face-to-face shootout in the open. When the dust settles, the three brothers are dead, but Judd is mortally wounded. He tells his old friend, \"I don't want them to see this. I'll go it alone.\" When Gil pledges to take care of everything just like he would have, Judd says, \"Hell, I know that. I always did. You just forgot it for a while, that's all.\" Judd casts a look back towards the high country and then dies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Randolph Scott]] as Gil Westrum \n* [[Joel McCrea]] as Steve Judd \n* [[Mariette Hartley]] as Elsa Knudsen \n* Ron Starr as Heck Longtree \n* [[Edgar Buchanan]] as Judge Tolliver \n* [[R.
