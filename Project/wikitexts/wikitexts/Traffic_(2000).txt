It explores the [[illegal drug trade]] from a number of perspectives: users, enforcers, politicians, and [[Drug trafficking|trafficker]]s. Their stories are edited together throughout the film, although some of the characters do not meet each other. The film is an adaptation of the 1989 British [[Channel 4]] television series ''[[Traffik]]''. The film stars an international [[ensemble cast]], including [[Don Cheadle]], [[Benicio del Toro]], [[Michael Douglas]], [[Erika Christensen]], [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]], [[Dennis Quaid]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]], [[Jacob Vargas]], [[Tomas Milian]], [[Topher Grace]], [[James Brolin]], [[Steven Bauer]], and [[Benjamin Bratt]]. It features both English and Spanish-language dialogue.\n\n[[20th Century Fox]], the original financiers of the film, demanded that [[Harrison Ford]] play a leading role and that significant changes to the screenplay be made. Soderbergh refused and proposed the script to other major Hollywood studios, but it was rejected because of the three-hour running time and the subject matter\u2014''Traffic'' is more of a [[political film]] than most Hollywood productions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/203|title= ''Traffic'': Border Wars|publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]] |author= Dargis, Manohla |author-link= Manohla Dargis }}</ref> [[Focus Features|USA Films]], however, liked the project from the start and offered the filmmakers more money than Fox. Soderbergh [[Camera operator|operated]] the camera himself and adopted a distinctive [[Color grading|color grade]] for each storyline so that audiences could tell them apart.\n\n''Traffic'' was released in the United States on December 27, 2000 and received critical acclaim for Soderbergh's direction, the style, the complexity, the messages, and the performances (particularly del Toro's). ''Traffic'' earned numerous awards, including four [[Academy Awards|Oscars]]: [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Steven Soderbergh, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for [[Benicio del Toro]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] for [[Stephen Gaghan]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] for [[Stephen Mirrione]]. It was also a commercial success with a worldwide box-office revenue total of $207.5 million, well above its estimated $46 million budget.\n\nIn 2004, [[USA Network]] ran a [[miniseries]]\u2014also called ''[[Traffic (miniseries)|Traffic]]''\u2014based on this film and the [[Traffik|1989 British television series]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=August 2021}}\n\n===Mexico storyline===\nIn [[Mexico]], police officer Javier Rodriguez and his partner Manolo Sanchez stop a drug transport and arrest the couriers. Their arrest is interrupted by General Salazar, a high-ranking Mexican official who decides to hire Javier. Salazar instructs him to apprehend Francisco Flores, a hitman for the [[Tijuana Cartel]], headed by the Obreg\u00f3n brothers. Salazar expresses that he wishes to shut down the Obreg\u00f3n cartel and that Flores will be the first step in doing so.\n\nBack in Tijuana, Flores, under torture, gives Salazar the names of important members of the Obreg\u00f3n cartel, who are soon arrested. Javier's and Salazar's efforts begin to cripple the Obreg\u00f3n brothers' cocaine outfit, but Javier soon discovers the truth. While transporting a woman under Salazar's orders, Javier and Manolo discover the house they arrive at is the home of Porfirio Madrigal, \"The Scorpion\"; the drug lord of the Ju\u00e1rez Cartel.\n\nThe two officers deduce that Salazar is a pawn for the [[Ju\u00e1rez Cartel]], and that the Mexican anti-drug campaign is a fraud. Salazar has been wiping out the Obreg\u00f3n cartel for profit, secretly being aligned with Madrigal and his Ju\u00e1rez operation. Manolo attempts to sell the information of Salazar's true affiliation to the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) but Salazar discovers his plot and has him murdered in the desert with Javier being forced to watch. No longer able to handle working for Salazar, Javier arranges a deal with the DEA. Javier expresses grief for turning against his government, but agrees to exchange his testimony for electricity in his neighborhood. If the neighborhood has electricity then the children will be able to play baseball at night where it's safe, instead of being lured into the toxic underworld of drugs and crime. Eventually, all of Salazar's secrets are revealed and he is placed under arrest. Soon after Salazar is shown dying in the same prison where Flores was tortured.\n\nAs the film ends, Javier is later shown sitting among other people on some bleachers at night. The people watch as young children laugh and play with one another during a game of baseball, none the wiser to the dark events of the drug world beyond them. Javier looks on knowing that, for a moment, the cycle of crime and pain has been stopped.\n\n===Wakefield storyline===\nRobert Wakefield, a conservative Ohio judge, is appointed to head the [[President of the United States|President]]'s [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]], taking on the title [[drug czar]]. Robert is warned by his predecessor and several influential politicians that the [[War on Drugs]] is unwinnable. Robert's teenage daughter, Caroline, a highly accomplished honors student, has been using [[cocaine]], [[methamphetamine]], and soon begins using [[heroin]]. Almost immediately, Caroline becomes addicted after her boyfriend Seth introduces her to [[freebasing]]. One night after a fellow student overdoses on cocaine, Caroline and her friends are arrested while trying to anonymously dump the student in front of the hospital. As Robert and his wife Barbara struggle to deal with the problem, Robert discovers that Barbara has known about their daughter's drug use for over six months. One night after an argument with his wife, Robert catches Caroline freebasing in the bathroom, completely high. Furious, Robert sends her to rehab before setting off to meet with General Salazar in Mexico City.\n\nOn a visit to Mexico, he is encouraged by Salazar's successful efforts in stifling the Obreg\u00f3n brothers cartel. Feeling the strain from his daughter's situation, Robert asks Salazar how the Mexican government is handling treatment of addiction. Robert is forced to hide his panic, when Salazar coldly replies that addicts \"treat themselves\" by overdosing. During this time, Caroline has managed to escape from her rehab facility and has run away.\n\nShe returns to [[Cincinnati]] to procure more drugs and ends up sleeping with Seth's drug dealer, high, as payment. By this time, Robert has learned that General Salazar has been arrested and has in fact been working against the anti-drug campaign. Then after finding that Caroline has stolen jewelry and money, Robert sets out desperately to find her himself. He drags Seth out of school and the two head for the drug dealer's location. Upon arrival, the dealer angrily refuses to give any information on Caroline and orders the two to leave at gunpoint. Later, Robert follows Seth to a seedy hotel the two had used before, and finds a semi-conscious Caroline about to be prostituted to an older man. Finding her alive, Robert breaks down in tears as Seth quietly leaves. Upon returning to [[Washington, D.C.]], Robert prepares to give his speech on a \"10-point plan\" to win the war on drugs. But when he cites drug addicts as the \"enemy,\" he falters upon realizing the tragedy of his own situation. He states that the War on Drugs implies a war even on some people's own family members, which he can no longer endorse, and walks out of the press conference to return to his family.\n\nRobert and Barbara go to a [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meeting with their daughter, where she remarks on the progress she's made. Robert responds with support for his daughter, and their full intention to \"listen\" moving forward.\n\n===Ayala/DEA storyline===\nIn [[San Diego]], an undercover [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] investigation is led by Montel Gordon and Ray Castro following a tip from an anonymous source. This leads to the arrest of Eduardo Ruiz, a high-stakes dealer posing as a storage-locker business owner. After some initial pressure, Ruiz decides to take the dangerous road to immunity by giving up his boss: [[drug lord]] Carl Ayala, the biggest distributor for the Obreg\u00f3n brothers in the United States. Ayala is indicted by a prosecutor chosen by Robert Wakefield, intending to send a message to the Mexican drug cartels.\n\nAs the trial against Ayala begins, his pregnant wife Helena learns of her husband's true profession from his associate, Arnie Metzger. Facing the prospect of life imprisonment for her husband and death threats against her child, Helena decides to step into Carl's underworld and looks into some of his contacts. She then hires Francisco Flores to assassinate Eduardo Ruiz; knowing that killing Ruiz will effectively end the trial ''[[nolle prosequi]]''. Flores plants a [[car bomb]] on a DEA car in an assassination, but Ruiz tells the agents he wants to walk to the hotel instead of taking the car; Helena orders Flores to shoot Ruiz on the sidewalk. As he goes to pull the trigger, Flores is shot by a cartel sniper for his cooperation with Javier and General Salazar, while the DEA guns him down in the confusion. Amidst the chaos Agent Castro runs to retrieve the car and is killed instantly, but leaving Gordon and Ruiz unharmed.\n\nHelena, knowing Ruiz will soon testify, meets with the drug lord Juan Obreg\u00f3n, head of the Obreg\u00f3n cartel. While they negotiate, Obreg\u00f3n speculates Ruiz and Ayala's downfall is due to a leak within their own organization. After a tense exchange, Helena and Obreg\u00f3n come to an agreement. In exchange for an undetectable and state-of-the-art cocaine distribution, the Ayala family will become the sole distributor of Obreg\u00f3n cocaine, will have their debt forgiven, and Eduardo Ruiz will be killed. On the day of his testimony, Ruiz is murdered after an Obreg\u00f3n associate poisons his breakfast disguised as a bellboy. Ruiz dies in agony with Gordon helpless, effectively ending the trial and setting Ayala free. During a phone conversation between Ayala and Metzger, Ayala deduces that it was Metzger who originally informed on Ruiz. Evidently in a bid for power with the Ju\u00e1rez cartel in Mexico, Metzger accepted $3 million to inform on Ruiz to the FBI and facilitate the Ayala and Obreg\u00f3n organization's downfall. As Ayala hangs up the phone, Metzger looks up to see two hitmen entering his office. Suddenly, Gordon bursts into the Ayala home during his homecoming celebration. Bodyguards wrestle him to the ground, but Gordon is able to surreptitiously plant a listening bug under Ayala's desk. Gordon is forced from the property, smiling to himself, knowing that there is now a new opportunity to trap Ayala and Helena.\n\n==Relationship to actual events==\nSome aspects of the plotline are based on actual people and events:\n* The character General Arturo Salazar is closely modeled after Mexican General [[Jos\u00e9 de Jes\u00fas Guti\u00e9rrez Rebollo|Jes\u00fas Guti\u00e9rrez Rebollo]], who was secretly on the payroll of [[Amado Carrillo Fuentes]], head of the [[Juarez Cartel]].\n* The character Porfirio Madrigal is modeled after Fuentes.\n* The Obreg\u00f3n brothers are modeled after the [[Tijuana Cartel]]'s [[Arellano F\u00e9lix]] brothers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Traffic, pel\u00edcula que podr\u00eda ser la cr\u00edtica m\u00e1s severa a la lucha antidrogas de EU |first=Jim |last=Cason |author2=David Brooks |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2001/01/09/012n1pol.html |work=[[La Jornada]] |language=es |date=2001-03-09 |access-date=2009-02-25 |archive-date=2011-05-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526033546/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2001/01/09/012n1pol.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Traffic |first=Ascanio |last=Cavallo |url=http://diario.elmercurio.cl/detalle/index.asp?id={783e7062-aab9-4a26-bffb-c1c3a3142a18} |work=[[El Mercurio]] |language=es |date=2001-03-10 |access-date=2009-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Shaw |first=Deborah |title=\"You Are Alright, But...\": Individual and Collective Representations of Mexicans, Latinos, Anglo-Americans and African-Americans in Steven Soderbergh's 'Traffic' |journal=[[Quarterly Review of Film and Video]] |volume=22 |pages=211\u2013223 |year=2005 |doi=10.1080/10509200490474339 |s2cid=190712388 |access-date=2009-02-25 |url=http://www.cfa.arizona.edu/mar453/Traffic%20Quarterly%20Review.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722133318/http://www.cfa.arizona.edu/mar453/Traffic%20Quarterly%20Review.htm |archive-date=2011-07-22 }}</ref>\n\nAt one point in the film, an [[El Paso Intelligence Center]] agent tells Robert his position, official in charge of drug control, doesn't exist in Mexico.

Analyzing this film helped the director deal with the large cast and working in many different locations for ''Traffic''.<ref name=\"Lyman\" />\n\n===Principal photography===\nHalf of the first day's footage came out overexposed and unusable.<ref name=\"Daly\" /> Before the financiers or studio bosses knew about the problem, Soderbergh was already doing reshoots. The insurers made him agree that any further mishaps resulting in additional filming would come out of the director's own pocket.<ref name=\"Daly\" /> Soderbergh shot in various cities in California, Ohio and Texas, on a 54-day schedule and came in $2 million under budget.<ref name=\"Hope\" /> The director acted as his own cinematographer under the [[pseudonym]] Peter Andrews and operated the camera himself in an effort to \"get as close to the movie as I can,\" and to eliminate the distance between the actors and himself.<ref>{{cite web|last1=French|first1=Phillip|title=Traffic|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,430492,00.html|website=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=March 29, 2018|date=January 28, 2001|archive-date=April 18, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418174448/http://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,430492,00.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Hope\" /> Soderbergh drew inspiration from the cinema verite style of [[Ken Loach]]'s films, studying the framing of scenes, the distance of the camera to the actors, lens length, and the tightness of eyelines depending on the position of a character. Soderbergh remembers, \"I noticed that there's a space that's inviolate, that if you get within something, you cross the edge into a more theatrical aesthetic as opposed to a documentary aesthetic\".<ref name=\"Hope\" /> Most of the day was spent shooting because a lot of the film was shot with available light.<ref name=\"Kaufman\" />\n\nFor the hand-held camera footage, Soderbergh used [[Panavision cameras|Panavision Millennium XL]]s that were smaller and lighter than previous cameras and allowed him to move freely.<ref name=\"Hope\" /> In order to tell the three stories apart, he adopted a distinctive look for each. For Robert Wakefield's story, Soderbergh used tungsten film with no filter for a cold, monochrome blue feel.<ref name=\"Hope\" /> For Helena Ayala's story, Soderbergh used diffusion filters, flashing the film, overexposing it for a warmer feel. For Javier Rodriguez's story, the director used tobacco filters and a 45-degree shutter angle whenever possible to produce a strobe-like sharp feel.<ref name=\"Hope\" /> Then, he took the entire film through an [[Ektachrome]] step, which increased the contrast and grain significantly.<ref name=\"Hope\" /> He wanted to have different looks for each story because the audience had to keep track of many characters and absorb a lot of information and he did not want them to have to figure out which story they were watching.<ref name=\"Lemons\" />\n\nBenicio del Toro had significant input into certain parts of the film; for example, he suggested a simpler, more concise way of depicting his character kidnapping Francisco Flores that Soderbergh ended up using.<ref name=\"Lemons\" /> The director cut a scene in which Robert Wakefield smokes crack after finding it in his daughter's bedroom. After rehearsing this scene with the actors, he felt that the character would not do it; after consulting with Gaghan, the screenwriter agreed and the filmmakers cut the scene shortly before it was scheduled to be shot.<ref name=\"Divine\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nThe first cut of ''Traffic'' ran three hours and ten minutes.<ref name=\"Hope\" /> Soderbergh cut it down to two hours and twenty minutes. Early on, there were concerns that the film might get an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#X is replaced by NC-17|NC-17]] rating and he was prepared to release it with that rating, but the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] gave it an R.<ref name=\"Hope\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Box office performance===\n''Traffic'' was given a limited release on December 27, 2000, in four theaters where it grossed {{USD|184,725}} on its opening weekend. It was given a wide release on January 5, 2001, in 1,510 theaters, grossing $15.5 million on its opening weekend.
