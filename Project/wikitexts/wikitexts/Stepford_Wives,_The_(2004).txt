After Joanna suffers a mental breakdown, she, her husband Walter Kresby, and their two children Pete and Kimberly move from [[Manhattan]] to Stepford, a quiet [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], [[Connecticut]] suburb. Upon the family's arrival, Joanna befriends writer and recovering [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] Roberta \"Bobbie\" Markowitz and Roger Bannister, a [[wikt:flamboyant|flamboyant]] [[Homosexuality|gay]] man who has moved to town with his long-time partner Jerry.\n\nAfter the trio witness Sarah Sunderson violently dance and then collapse, Joanna argues with Walter about the incident until Walter bluntly informs her that her children barely know her, their marriage is falling apart, and her domineering nature makes people want to kill her. As he tries to walk out of their marriage, Joanna apologizes and agrees to appease him by trying to fit in with the other wives. The next day, Joanna, Bobbie and Roger go to Sarah's home to check up on her, where upon entering, they hear her upstairs, ecstatically screaming during sex with her husband Herb. As they scramble to sneak out they find a [[remote control]] labeled SARAH, discovering a button that causes Sarah's breasts to enlarge and makes her walk backwards robotically.\n\nOne evening, Walter and Bobbie's husband Dave go to the Men's Association with Roger and Jerry, but Joanna and Bobbie hire a babysitter and sneak inside to spy on them and the other husbands. They discover a hall filled with family portraits but Roger catches them and assures them that all is well. The next day, the pair discover Roger's flamboyant clothing, [[Playbill]] program from ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'', and photo of [[Orlando Bloom]] have all been discarded. Jerry tells them to meet him in the town hall and they see Roger, apparently running for State Senate, with a bland look and conformist personality. Joanna wants to leave and Walter agrees, saying they will go the next day. Going into Walter's study, she discovers that all the Stepford wives were once working women in high-power positions.\n\nThe next day, Joanna visits Bobbie, noticing that her formerly messy house is spotless. Now blending in with the other Stepford wives, Bobbie says she is a whole new person and the most important thing is her cookbook. While offering to help Joanna change, Bobbie obliviously puts her hand over the stove's burner. Returning to the Men's Association, Joanna finds that in her family picture she now resembles a Stepford wife. Men's Association leader Mike shows how they insert nanochips into their wives' brains to make them Stepford wives. The men corner Joanna and Walter, force them toward the transformation room, but Joanna asks if the new wives really mean it when they tell their husbands that they love them. The next scene shows the Stepford wives, including Joanna, now blonde and dressed in Sunday dresses, at the grocery store.\n\nWith Joanna and Walter as special guests, Stepford hosts a [[Ball (dance party)|formal ball]]. During the festivities, Joanna distracts Mike and entices him into the garden, while Walter slips away to the transformation room where he destroys the software that programs the women. At the ball, the wives corner their husbands and reveal that Joanna never received the microchip implant. Mike threatens Walter, but Joanna decapitates him with a candlestick, exposing him as a robot. Mike's wife Claire explains that she created Stepford because she, too, was a bitter career-minded woman. When she discovered Mike's affair with her research assistant, she [[murder]]ed them in a jealous rage. Claire then [[Electrocution|electrocutes]] herself by kissing Mike's severed robotic head.\n\nSix months later, in an interview with [[Larry King]], Joanna (who has won six [[Emmy Awards|Emmys]] for producing the hard-hitting documentary ''Stepford: The Secret of the Suburbs''), Roger (who has won his State Senate seat as an Independent) and Bobbie (who has written and published her first book of poetry ''Wait Until He's Asleep, Then Cut It Off'') explain that the Stepford husbands are being retrained to become better people. The closing scene reveals that the wives have now taken over Stepford and have placed their husbands under house arrest, making them complete the same domestic tasks that they had forced the women to do.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Joanna Eberhart\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as Walter Kresby\n* [[Bette Midler]] as Roberta \"Bobbie\" Markowitz\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Mike Wellington\n* [[Glenn Close]] as Claire Wellington\n* [[Roger Bart]] as Roger Bannister\n* [[Faith Hill]] as Sarah Sunderson\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] as Dave Markowitz\n* [[Matt Malloy]] as Herb Sunderson\n* [[David Marshall Grant]] as Jerry Harmon\n* [[Kate Shindle]] as Beth Peters\n* [[Lorri Bagley]] as Charmaine Van Sant\n* [[Lisa Lynn Masters]] as Carol Wainwright\n* [[Robert Stanton (actor)|Robert Stanton]] as Ted Van Sant \n* [[Mike White (scriptwriter)|Mike White]] as Hank\n* [[Carrie Preston]] as Barbara\n* [[KaDee Strickland]] as Tara\n* [[Larry King]] as Himself\n* [[Meredith Vieira]] as host of ''Balance of Power''\n* [[Billy Bush]] as host of ''I Can Do Better''\n* [[Mary Beth Peil]] as Helen Devlin\n* Dylan Hartigan as Pete Kresby, Joanna and Walter's son\n\n==Production==\n[[John Cusack]] was originally cast as Walter and his sister [[Joan Cusack]] was originally cast as Bobbie.
