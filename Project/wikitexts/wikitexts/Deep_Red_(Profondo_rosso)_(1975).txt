It stars [[David Hemmings]] as a musician who investigates a series of murders performed by a mysterious figure wearing black leather gloves. The cast also stars [[Daria Nicolodi]], [[Gabriele Lavia]], [[Macha M\u00e9ril]], and [[Clara Calamai]]. The film's score was composed and performed by [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]], the first in a long-running collaboration with Argento.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hernandez|first=Raoul|title=Goblin's Claudio Simonetti Paints Austin Deep Red|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/music/2019-09-25/goblins-claudio-simonetti-paints-austin-deep-red/|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|date=25 September 2019|access-date=5 June 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe film was released during the height of the \"giallo craze\" of Italian popular cinema, and was a critical and commercial success. Retrospective reviews have been equally positive, and the film is considered one of the genre's definitive entries, as well as one of Argento's best works.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring Christmas at a family home, one figure stabs another to death. A bloody knife falls to the floor at a child's feet. Twenty years later in Turin, Professor Giordani chairs a [[parapsychology]] conference featuring [[Psychic Medium|psychic medium]] Helga Ulmann. Helga is suddenly overwhelmed by the \"twisted, perverted, murderous\" thoughts of someone in the audience and claims hearing a child's song. She believes she can identify this person; an unseen figure suddenly leaves the theater.\n\nLater that night, a black-gloved figure invades Helga's apartment and attacks her with a meat cleaver. English [[Jazz]] musician and [[bandleader]] Marcus Daly sees the murder from the window as he passes by, and rushes to her apartment, finding her mutilated corpse. After the police arrive, Marcus thinks one of the apartment's paintings has disappeared, but he cannot pinpoint what exactly is missing.\n\nThe media identifies Marcus as the eyewitness and shows reporter Gianna Brezzi's photo of him. The next morning, after arguing with Gianna about women's liberation, Marcus visits his friend's home, Carlo,  to check on him but only finds Carlo's eccentric mother Martha, who seems interested in Marcus. Back in his house, someone plays a recording of a child's song outside Marcus' door; he manages to lock the door before the person can enter, but he hears the gruff whisper, \"I'll kill you sooner or later.\" Marcus tells Giordani, whom he met at Helga's funeral, about the encounter. Giordani, noting that Helga also heard a child's song, recalls a book of modern [[folklore]] describing a local haunted house where a child's song is sometimes heard. Feeling guilty for taking his photo, Gianna begins helping Marcus.\n\nMarcus reads the folklore book and finds a photo of the house in it. He rips out the picture, planning to learn more from the book's author. However, the killer, who has been watching Marcus, attacks the author and drowns her in scalding water. Using the photo, Marcus finds and investigates the huge abandoned house. Under sheetrock he uncovers a disturbing mural: a child holding a bloody knife over a dead body. He leaves for the night before the full image of the mural is revealed. Meanwhile, Giordani, who has been assisting Marcus' investigation, visits the scene of the author's murder and uses steam to find a clue written on the mirror. However, later the killer distracts him with a mechanized doll, before murdering him. \n[[File:Villa Scott in Turin, Italy (2019).jpg|right|thumb|Villa Scott, \"The House of the Screaming Child\" in the film.]]\nMarcus finds a walled-off room in the abandoned house. In the middle of the dusty floor sits a [[Desiccation|desiccated]] corpse. Someone knocks Marcus unconscious as he backs away in horror. He awakens outside the house, which is burning. Gianna appears, explaining that she got his message about investigating the house and arrived in time to save him. As Marcus and Gianna wait at the caretaker's house for the police, Marcus notices that the caretaker's daughter has drawn a picture identical to the hidden mural he found in the house. She tells him she saw the picture in the archives of the local school.\n\nMarcus and Gianna immediately go to the school. Marcus finds the drawing in a schoolboy's record. When Gianna leaves to call the police, someone stabs her. Marcus corners the attacker\u2013it is Carlo, who as a kid drew the disturbing pictures. The police arrive, and Carlo flees into the dark street where a garbage truck hits him and drags him down the street. When the truck stops, an oncoming car runs over Carlo's head.\n\nAt the hospital, Marcus learns that Gianna has survived. Remembering that the night Helga died he met Carlo utterly intoxicated and coming from a very different direction than the scene of the killing, Marcus reinvestigates the apartment crime scene. There, he has an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]]: the night of Helga's murder it was not a missing painting he saw when he entered the apartment, but rather a reflection of the killer, framed in a mirror. As Marcus realizes he saw Martha, Carlo's mother, she appears behind him with a meat cleaver. Martha explains that she murdered her husband, while the child's song played in the back, in front of the young Carlo, as he had intended to put her in an [[insane asylum]]. She then walled off the room containing his body. Carlo, scarred psychologically, tried to repress the memory of the homicide compulsively drawing it and later taking up alcohol: he attacked Marcus and Gianna to protect his murderous mother from their investigation.\n\nMartha attacks Marcus and wounds him with the cleaver. After Martha's necklace tangles in the bars of the building's elevator, Marcus sends the elevator down, decapitating her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[David Hemmings]] as Marcus Daly\n* [[Daria Nicolodi]] as Gianna Brezzi\n* [[Gabriele Lavia]] as Carlo Manganiello\n** Jacopo Mariani as young Carlo\n* [[Macha M\u00e9ril]] as Helga Ulmann\n* [[Eros Pagni]] as Police Supt.

It was his last [[giallo]] film before ''[[Tenebre (film)|Tenebre]]'' (1982), which was produced years after the genre's heyday.\n\nThe film was also his first collaboration with actress [[Daria Nicolodi]], with whom he would begin a relationship during this film, and progressive rock band [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]], who composed and performed the film score.<ref>{{cite web|last=Helfet|first=Gabriela|title=Iconic Goblin and Dario Argento soundtrack themes reissued on limited Super Dario 12|url=https://thevinylfactory.com/news/goblin-dario-argento-soundtrack-vinyl-super-dario/|work=[[The Vinyl Factory]]|date=31 May 2018|access-date=5 June 2021}}</ref> Argento would collaborate with Nicolodi five more times, and Goblin or its frontman [[Claudio Simonetti]] ten more times.

''Blood and Black Lace: The Definitive Guide to Italian Sex and Horror Movies''. Stray Cat Publishing Ltd. p. 36</ref>\n\nCo-writer [[Bernardino Zapponi]] said the inspiration for the murder scenes came from him and Argento thinking of painful injuries to which the audience could relate, as the pain of being stabbed or shot is outside the experience of most viewers.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Their original screenplay ran approximately 500 pages, but after it was deemed unfilmable, Argento shortened it to 321. The use of a psychic medium originated from an early draft of ''[[Four Flies on Grey Velvet]]'' (1971).\n\nThe close-up shots of the killer's hands, clad in black leather gloves, were performed by director [[Dario Argento]] himself. Argento was convinced that having all the killing scenes performed by himself would be quicker and easier than teaching the moves to an actor, who would require endless re-takes to perform everything to the director's satisfaction.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The film's special effects, which include several mechanically operated heads and body parts, were created and executed by [[Carlo Rambaldi]].\n\nAs was common in Italian filmmaking at the time, ''Deep Red'' was shot without [[sync sound]], and all dialogue was [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] in post-production. The screenplay was written in both Italian and English, all actors except for [[Clara Calamai]] spoke in English. The Italian dub cast included [[Isa Bellini]] (Calamai), [[Wanda Tettoni]] (Del Balzo), and [[Corrado Gaipa]] (Meniconi). The English dub cast included [[Cyril Cusack]], [[Ted Rusoff]], [[Carolyn De Fonseca]], [[Geoffrey Copleston]], [[Michael Forest]], and [[Edward Mannix]]. [[David Hemmings]] dubbed himself.\n\n==Release==\n''Deep Red'' was released in Milan and Rome in Italy on 7 March 1975.<ref name=\"darkness\">{{cite book|title=Art of Darkness: The Cinema of Dario Argento|page=279|last=Gallant|first=Chris|year=2000|isbn=1903254078|publisher=Fab Press}}</ref>\nIn the United States, the film first premiered in New York City on 9 June 1976 and saw a wide theatrical release\non 11 June 1976 by the defunct US independent film distributor Howard Mahler Films.

For years, it was assumed that the film's American distributors were responsible for removing said scenes, but the recent Blu-ray release confirmed that Argento oversaw and approved the edits to the film.\n\nEleven seconds of animal cruelty cuts made to the film by the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] in 1993 were waived when the film was re-submitted in 2010. Upon consideration, examiners concluded that the 'fighting' dogs were actually playing, and a letter sent from the production company stated that the lizard on a knife was a 'visual effect'.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nIn 1999, Anchor Bay acquired the rights to release the film uncut on both DVD and VHS.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Their version restored the missing footage but kept the American end credit scene (a freeze-frame shot of Hemmings looking down into a pool of blood). As there were no dubbed versions of the missing scenes, the scenes (and additional dialogue omitted in the dubbed version) were featured in their original Italian language. The DVD offered both English and Italian audio tracks as well.\n\nBlue Underground obtained the rights to the film in 2008{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} and released it as a standard DVD. Their Blu-ray release, released in 2011, contains the US version of the film (which is referred to as \"The Director's Cut\") and the original edit (referred to as \"Uncut\" and contains option to watch it in either language).\n\n[[Arrow Films]], a distributor of the United Kingdom, acquired the rights to the film and released it on January 3, 2011.

Their leader [[Claudio Simonetti]] impressed Argento by producing two compositions within just one night. Argento signed them immediately, and they ended up composing most of the film's musical score<ref name=\"Danish DVD\"/> (three Gaslini compositions were retained in the final version). Subsequently, Goblin composed music for several other films by Dario Argento.\n\nThe soundtrack was made available for the first time ever on vinyl after Waxwork Records released the complete score by Goblin on a triple LP.

Most US versions remove 22 minutes' worth of footage, including the most graphic violence, all humorous scenes, almost all of the romantic scenes between David Hemmings and Daria Nicolodi, and part of the subplot regarding the house of the screaming child.\n* The US video release by [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] is mostly restored, reinstating gore shots and scenes with dialogue that were cut from the initial US release. It was likely that these scenes were cut before the English dub was prepared, so they now only exist with an Italian dub (English subtitles are provided for these scenes). In the original theatrical version, the end credits are displayed over a shot of Marcus' reflection in a pool of blood. The image is moving (blood drips into the pool, Hemmings' face changes expression, etc.) while the credits are displayed. Anchor Bay's release features the credits over a freeze-frame of the original shot. Other than this change, the Anchor Bay [[VHS]]/[[DVD]] is the full, uncut version of the film.\n* The later DVD release from [[Blue Underground]] is the exact version mentioned above. Also, Blue Underground released an \"Uncensored English Version\" on DVD on 17 May 2011. This cut of the film runs no more than 105 minutes, with the gore from the original Italian version intact but the other cuts from the edited English version again excised.<ref>{{cite web |title=DEEP RED (Uncensored English Version) |url=http://www.blue-underground.com/product.php?product=200 |publisher=[[Blue Underground]] |access-date=2014-08-26}}</ref>\n* The film had no UK theatrical release. The 1993 Redemption video was cut by 11 seconds to remove a brief scene of two dogs fighting and shots of a live lizard impaled with a pin. The 2005 Platinum DVD issue was pre-cut (to exclude the shot of the lizard) and restored the dog sequence (as it was evident that they were playing rather than fighting). It was finally passed uncut for the 2010 Arrow DVD release.\n* The full-length Italian version (with English subtitles and one small cut by UK censors) is available on video in the UK in [[pan and scan]] format from Redemption Films. The only known [[widescreen]] print of this version can be found in Australia on both [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS TV]] and its pay-TV channel World Movies, completely uncut. (Note that the widescreen [[laserdisc]] release is in English language and was cut by director Argento himself by about 12 minutes).\n* Some releases of the film incorporate a still from the film, revealing the murderer.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Profondo Rosso (store)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"broken\">{{cite book\n|last=McDonagh|first=Maitland\n|title=Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento\n|year=2010\n|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis\n|isbn=978-0-8166-5607-3\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0073582}}\n* {{Amg movie|89073|Deep Red}}\n* {{Internet Archive film|id=DeepRed1975}} \u2013 98 minute edited U.S. theatrical version (101 minutes with credits) in pan-and-scan format\n* [http://whiggles.landofwhimsy.com/writings/commentaries.html ''Commentary by DVD Talk critic Michael Mackenzie'']\n\n{{Dario Argento}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1975 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:1970s thriller films]]\n[[Category:1975 films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Goblin (band)]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Dario Argento]]\n[[Category:Giallo films]]\n[[Category:Italian LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Italian horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:1970s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:Home invasions in film]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related horror films]]\n[[Category:Paranormal films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Dario Argento]]\n[[Category:Italian serial killer films]]\n[[Category:Women and death]]\n[[Category:Films set in country houses]]\n[[Category:Films set in Turin]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Turin]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Rome]]\n[[Category:1970s Christmas horror films]]\n[[Category:Italian exploitation films]]\n[[Category:Italian splatter films]]\n[[Category:1970s Italian films]]"}]}}}}
