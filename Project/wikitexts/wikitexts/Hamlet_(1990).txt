The film also features [[Glenn Close]], [[Alan Bates]], [[Paul Scofield]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], [[Stephen Dillane]], and [[Nathaniel Parker]]. An international co-production between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Italy, the film was the first produced by [[Icon Productions]], a company co-founded by Gibson.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film largely follows the plot of the [[Hamlet#Plot|original play]], albeit omitting certain dialogue and minor characters to fit the average length of a feature film. This version also makes no modern day adaptations.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as [[Prince Hamlet]]\n* [[Glenn Close]] as [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Queen Gertrude]]\n* [[Alan Bates]] as [[King Claudius]]\n* [[Paul Scofield]] as the ghost of [[King Hamlet]]\n* [[Ian Holm]] as [[Polonius]]\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]]\n* [[Stephen Dillane]] as [[Horatio (character)|Horatio]]\n* [[Nathaniel Parker]] as [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]]\n* [[Michael Maloney]] and Sean Murray as [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]\n* [[Trevor Peacock]] as the Gravedigger\n* [[Pete Postlethwaite]] as the Player King\n* [[Christopher Fairbank]] as the Player Queen\n* [[John McEnery]] as [[Characters in Hamlet#Osric|Osric]]\n* [[Richard Warwick]] as [[Characters in Hamlet#Elsinore sentries|Bernardo]]\n* [[Christien Anholt]] as [[Characters in Hamlet#Elsinore sentries|Marcellus]]\n\n==Production==\nZeffirelli announced production of the film in April 1989 at a press conference in Los Angeles. Mel Gibson was at that same press conference, where it was announced that he would play Hamlet. Zeffirelli had set out to make a Shakespearian adaptation that would be accessible and appealing to younger viewers, and casting Gibson was considered an intent to lure said audience into seeing it.<ref name=\"ear\" /> Glenn Close was another obvious choice, having had recent box-office success with such Hollywood thrillers as ''[[Jagged Edge (film)|Jagged Edge]]'' and ''[[Fatal Attraction]]''.\n\nFinancing was provided on loan from a Dutch bank by [[Carolco Pictures]], [[Barry Spikings]]' Nelson Entertainment, and Sovereign Pictures for approximately $16&nbsp;million. Filming was set to begin on 23 April 1990, with an 11-week shooting schedule.<ref name=\"ear\">{{Cite web |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/58533-HAMLET |title=Detail view of Movies Page \u2013 HAMLET (1990) |publisher=afi.com |access-date=20 September 2020 }}</ref>\n\nGibson, who had grown up idolizing one of his costars, legendary Shakespearean actor [[Paul Scofield]], compared the experience of performing Shakespeare alongside him to being, \"thrown into [[boxing ring|the ring]] with [[Mike Tyson]]\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Paul Scofield's career highlights |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1582308/Paul-Scofields-career-highlights.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=20 March 2008 |access-date= 16 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Dunnottar Castle]], [[Stonehaven]] and [[Blackness Castle]] were used as locations in the film. [[Dover Castle]] provided the main location for Elsinore Castle, the home of Hamlet and his family.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=https://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/filmed-in-kent/1990/11/hamlet-1990/|title=Kent Film Office Hamlet Film Focus}}</ref> Interiors were filmed at [[Shepperton Studios]] in London.<ref name=\"ear\" />\n\n[[Norma Moriceau]] was the project's initial costume designer, but quit for unknown reasons, to be replaced by [[Maurizio Millenotti]]. Tailors from Shepperton assembled the costumes.<ref name=\"ear\" />\n\nThe film attracted little attention from major Hollywood studios, until post-production, when companies such as [[Warner Bros.]], [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], and [[Orion Pictures|Orion]] expressed interest in purchasing the film. Nelson Entertainment, which held the North American distribution rights, licensed theatrical exhibition to Warner as part of an incentive to lure Gibson into making ''[[Lethal Weapon 3]]''. Despite Nelson owning a home video arm, they sold the video rights to Warner as well. Warner Bros. attempted to attract high schools with study guides and vouchers for students. An hour-long educational video titled ''Mel Gibson Goes Back to School'' was released in conjunction with the film, showing the actor lecturing ''Hamlet'' to a group of high-school students in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"ear\" />\n\n==Adaptation and interpretation==\nFilm scholar Deborah Cartmell has suggested that Zeffirelli's Shakespeare films are appealing because they are \"sensual rather than cerebral\", an approach by which he aims to make Shakespeare \"even more popular\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Deborah|last=Cartmell|chapter=Zeffirelli and Shakespeare|editor-first=Russell|editor-last=Jackson|title=The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Film|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani00jack|url-access=limited|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge, England|date=2007|edition=Second|isbn=978-0521866002|page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani00jack/page/n222 216]}}</ref> To this end, he cast Gibson \u2013 then famous for the ''[[Mad Max]]'' and ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' films \u2013 in the title role. Cartmell also notes that the text is drastically cut, but with the effect of enhancing the roles of the women.\n\nJ. Lawrence Guntner has suggested that Zeffirelli's cinematography borrows heavily from the [[action film]] genre that made Gibson famous, noting that its average shot length is less than six seconds.<ref>{{cite book|first=J.
