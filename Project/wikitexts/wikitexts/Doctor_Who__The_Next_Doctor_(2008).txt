In the episode, the Doctor seems to meet another incarnation of himself with memory loss who apparently is the Doctor. The two of them discover a plot by the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] to create a giant-sized Cyberman called a CyberKing which is controlled by the workhouse matron Miss Hartigan ([[Dervla Kirwan]]).\n\n\"The Next Doctor\" was the last ''Doctor Who'' episode to be filmed in [[Standard-definition television|standard-definition]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Tenth Doctor]] lands his [[TARDIS]] in London on Christmas Eve, 1851. Overhearing cries for help, he encounters a man calling himself \"the Doctor\" and his companion Rosita, attempting and failing to capture a [[Cyberman#Variants|Cybershade]]. The Doctor believes the man, who is suffering from amnesia, may be a future incarnation of himself. The man, dubbed the Next Doctor, takes the Doctor to a nearby house of a recently deceased reverend, believing him tied to a series of disappearances around London and the Cybershade. Inside, they discover a pair of [[Cyberman]] data-storage infostamps, which the Next Doctor recalls holding the night that he lost his memories.\n\nThe two Doctors regroup with Rosita at the Next Doctor's base. The Doctor comes to realise that the Next Doctor is really a human, Jackson Lake, the supposed first missing person. The Doctor suspects that Jackson had encountered the Cybermen and used the infostamps, containing knowledge of the Doctor, to ward them off. Jackson's mind then entered a [[fugue state]] from the trauma of the Cybermen killing his wife, and as the infostamp had infused his mind with knowledge of the Doctor, he came to believe he was the Doctor. The Doctor and Rosita set off to try to find the source of the Cybermen.\n \nThe Doctor and Rosita find numerous children, pulled from workhouses around the city by Miss Mercy Hartigan, are being put to work at an underground facility under Cybermen guard. The Cybermen betray Miss Hartigan, and convert her into the controller for the \"CyberKing\", a giant mechanical Cyberman powered by the energy generated by the children. She also gains control over the Cybermen. Jackson remembers encountering the Cybermen on moving into his new home. The Doctor discovers another entrance to the Cybermen's base under Jackson's house. Within the complex, as the CyberKing starts to rise to the city, the three rescue the children, including Jackson's son, who was abducted in the initial attack that triggered Jackson's fugue state. The CyberKing starts to lay waste to the city. When Miss Hartigan refuses the Doctor's offer to leave the planet, the Doctor uses the infostamps to sever her connection to the CyberKing, exposing her to the raw emotion of what she has done. The emotional feedback destroys both the Cybermen and Miss Hartigan. As the CyberKing starts to topple, the Doctor draws it into the Time Vortex with technology from Jackson's cellar, saving London. The episode ends with the Doctor and Jackson heading off to attend Christmas dinner in remembrance of those they have lost.\n\n===Continuity===\nAccording to [[Neil Gaiman]], the Cybus Industries Cybermen \"zapped off into time and space\" by the Doctor at the end of this episode eventually encountered the [[Mondas]] Cybermen; their \"cross-breeding and interchange of technology\" resulted in the variety of Cybermen seen in \"[[Nightmare in Silver]]\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2013/05/07/exclusive-neil-gaiman-talks-doctor-who-and-cybermen/|title=EXCLUSIVE \u2013 Neil Gaiman Talks Doctor Who And Cybermen|magazine=[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]|last=Setchfields|first=Nick|date=7 May 2013|access-date=2 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\n[[File:DoctorWhoExhibition 089 (4262528286).jpg|right|thumb|180px|A Cybershade on display at the Doctor Who Experience]]\nPre-broadcast publicity, based on excerpts from Davies' book ''Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale'', revealed that the Doctor would meet a man played by David Morrissey who also claims to be the Doctor. In further excerpts, Davies commented, \"The best title for this episode would be ''The Two Doctors''...&nbsp;but maybe not. ''The New Doctor'', perhaps? Or ''The Next Doctor''? I quite like ''The Next Doctor''.\"<ref name=\"WritersTaleBook\">{{Cite book| last=Davies | first=Russell T | author-link=Russell T Davies |author2=Cook, Benjamin |author-link2=Benjamin Cook (journalist)  | title=The Writer's Tale | publisher=[[BBC Books]] | date=25 September 2008 | pages=500\u2013502 | isbn=978-1-84607-571-1}}</ref> The book also contained two pictures from a scene cut from the end of the previous episode, intended to segue into the special echoing the previous two series. This scene was included on the series boxset.\n\nFollowing the success of the previous year's Christmas special, \"[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]\", which guest starred pop star [[Kylie Minogue]] as one-off companion [[Astrid Peth]], Russell T Davies had initially felt tempted to copy this format with another high-profile guest star, but decided against it after jokingly offering up \"[[Cheryl Cole]] on board the ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]''\" as an example.<ref name=\"Doctor Who Confidential\" />\n\nRegarding an unanswered question (from a child) of why a gigantic robot in London 1851 \"isn't in the history books\", Davies and Gardner jokingly offer several possibilities ranging from there being alternate history of ''Doctor Who'' England, pointing out \"a spaceship didn't fly into the [[Big Ben]] in 2006 either\" (in the episode \"[[Aliens of London]]\") or that perhaps \"maybe everyone was [[List of Torchwood items#A|retconned]] by the soon-to-be-born [[Torchwood Institute|Torchwood]], or something.\"<ref name=\"Doctor Who: The Commentaries\" /> A line in [[Steven Moffat]]'s [[Doctor Who (2010 series)|series 5]] episode \"[[Flesh and Stone]]\" has the Doctor recall the Cyberking's rampage, attributing history's failure to record it to the cracks in time and space that are causing time to be unwritten.<ref>{{cite episode|title=[[Flesh and Stone]]|series=[[Doctor Who]]|credits=[[Steven Moffat]] (writer), Adam Smith (director), [[Tracie Simpson]] (producer)|airdate=1 May 2010|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC One]]|series-no=5|number=5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Steven|last=Cooper|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2010/05/doctor-who-season-5-episode-5-%E2%80%9Cflesh-and-stone%E2%80%9D/|title=Doctor Who: Season 5, Episode 5: \"Flesh and Stone\"|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=15 May 2010|access-date=4 December 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100518204446/http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2010/05/doctor-who-season-5-episode-5-%E2%80%9Cflesh-and-stone%E2%80%9D/|archive-date=18 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nDavies, from a writer's standpoint, was also unhappy with the final scene in the episode where the Doctor gets rid of the Cyberking with the convenient Dalek dimension vault but during the writing process he couldn't think of another way to stop London being crushed by a giant robot. Later, after the episode was produced, a different idea came to him. In this alternate ending Davies imagines, Miss Hartigan \"should have destroyed the Cybermen when she screamed... but she's still in the chair\", as the Cyberking falls to the Earth, the Doctor calls out to her saying \"Save them.\" This version would have Hartigan redeem herself as she is the one to cause the Cyberking to disappear, with no need for what Davies calls \"a silly Dalek continuum dimension vault\". Julie Gardner felt this would have been a superior, \"marvellous\" ending and Davies says he \"can't bear that there could have been a better ending than we actually transmitted\".<ref name=\"Doctor Who: The Commentaries\" />\n\nDavies also feels he would like to write a [[BBC Books]] novel, set in the midst of that brief scene where Jackson Lake is in the Doctor's TARDIS in which the Doctor takes Jackson to another planet, ending with the \"no no no\" scene before Jackson invites the Doctor to spend Christmas dinner with him.<ref name=\"Doctor Who: The Commentaries\" />\n\nDavies claims that he attempted to make Jackson Lake's companion Rosita a combination of Rose and Martha so that she felt like a companion before she had done anything.<ref name=\"Next Doctor Commentary Podcast\">{{Cite web|last=Davies|first=Russell T|title=The Next Doctor Commentary Podcast|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/episodes/S0_05|publisher=BBC|access-date=1 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Locations===\nFilming for this episode was conducted in April 2008 at [[Gloucester Cathedral]],<ref name=\"Hello\">{{Cite news| url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/film/2008/04/23/doctor-who-christmas/ | work=[[Hello Magazine]] | title=David films 'Dr Who' Christmas special in 'snowy' Gloucester | access-date=5 July 2008 | date=23 April 2008}}</ref> [[St Woolos Cemetery]] in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]<ref name=\"Argus\">{{Cite news| url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/swanews/display.var.2188951.0.cybermen_invade_newport.php | work=[[South Wales Argus]] | access-date=5 July 2008 | author=David Deans | date=4 April 2008 | title=Cybermen invade Newport}}</ref> and the streets of Gloucester, where shooting was hampered by up to 1,000 onlookers.

A lot of her characterisation goes unstated, but Russell discussed it in long conversations with Dervla Kirwan and fellow executive producer Julie Gardner. Davies characterises Miss Hartigan as \"a victim of abuse\", for whom the [[subtext]] suggests a \"terrible [[back-story|backstory]]\" which is symptomatic of her being \"part of [this] Victorian Age.\" Davies describes this as being \"a powerless woman who's been in servitude or far worse all her life\", but holds his tongue from saying her precise profession, relaying: \"I'm talking quite discreetly around this because there are children listening and watching and there's only so far I should go.\" He does however explain that \"She's had terrible things done to her\" which is responsible for her \"really twisted character where she sexualises everything.\" In terms of costume, \"she wears red\" because \"everything's inflammatory with her\". \"And in the end, actually\" Davies discusses how to escape her male oppression she \"becomes a man, she becomes the CyberKing. She has to go through this extraordinary process because she's so damaged.\"<ref name=\"Doctor Who: The Commentaries\"/> Kirwan would later go on to voice Miss Quill, replacing the original actress [[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]], in the audio dramas of Doctor Who spin-off [[Class (2016 TV series)|\"Class\"]] produced by [[Big Finish Productions]] in 2019.\n\n===Design===\nMillennium FX's Neil Gorton's original design for the Cybershade took the existing Cyberman design and \"refurbished\" it by adding rivets and a copper finish. The design was cost-effective but Russell T Davies did not believe it was the right approach. He sketched a new design for the Cybershade that was \"a crude version of a Cyberman, all angular and blocky, with its trademark handlebars set at a jaunty angle and shrouded in flowing black robes\". Gorton used Davies' sketch to create a fibreglass mask that the Cybershade actors wore over their heads. Costume designer Louise Page made the flowing robes, that were \"light enough to not restrict movement\" to complete the Cybershade costume.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Gorton | first = Neil | date= 10 December 2008 | title= How I... designed the Cybershade | url= http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/technology/indepth/2008/12/how_i_designed_the_cybershade.html | work= Broadcastnow | publisher= Emap Media | access-date= 11 December 2008}}</ref> A new head design for the Cyber Leader was also introduced, sporting a black face and handles and an exposed brain similar to the one of the Cyber Controller from \"[[The Age of Steel]]\" (2006).\n\nOriginally, Gardner relayed that there was a widespread dissatisfaction with Hartigan's CyberKing crown. The original helmet, he remarked \"was like the Cyberwoman's head from ''[[Torchwood]]''\" (referring to the episode \"[[Cyberwoman]]\"), literally \"a Cyberman's head on Dervla Kirwan\" or \"as if Dervla Kirwan decided to go to a [fancy dress] party as a Cyberman.\" Davies' response was \"Oh my lord, no.\" The production team however worked hard, and in two days produced the final headpiece seen in the episode which Davies described as \"beautiful\", because it's \"Victorian and it fits the design.\" In the scene after the headpiece is placed on her, Dervla wore black contact lenses and SFX company The Mill helped to get rid of \"any traces of white\" in post-production.<ref name=\"Doctor Who: The Commentaries\"/>\n\n==Broadcast==\nPreliminary figures show that the episode had a viewing audience of 11.71 million during its original airing, with a peak at 12.58 million viewers, and a 50.5% share of the 18:00 timeslot it was shown.
