Starring [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Nick Stahl]], [[Claire Danes]], and [[Kristanna Loken]], it is the third installment in the [[Terminator (franchise)|''Terminator'' franchise]] and a sequel to ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991). In its plot, the malevolent artificial intelligence [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]] sends a [[T-X|Terminator]] (Loken)\u2014a highly advanced killing machine\u2014back in time to ensure the rise of machines by killing top members of the future human resistance as [[John Connor]]'s (Stahl) location is unknown. The resistance sends back a less-advanced reprogrammed [[Terminator (character)|Terminator]] (Schwarzenegger) to protect John and Kate.\n\nWhile ''Terminator'' creator [[James Cameron]] was interested in directing the third film, he ultimately had no involvement with ''Terminator 3''. [[Andrew G. Vajna]] and [[Mario Kassar]], who had produced ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' through their company [[Carolco Pictures]], obtained the rights for the franchise through both Carolco's [[liquidation]] auction and negotiations with producer [[Gale Ann Hurd]]. In 1999, [[Tedi Sarafian]] was hired to write the first draft of the script. Mostow joined the project as director in 2001, and he brought on [[John Brancato and Michael Ferris]] to rewrite Sarafian's script. The $187 million budget included a $5 million salary for Mostow and a record $30 million salary for Schwarzenegger. Filming took place in California from April to September 2002. [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) and [[Stan Winston]] created the special effects, as they did for the previous film.\n\n''Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines'' premiered in [[Westwood, Los Angeles]], on June 30, 2003, and was released on July 2, 2003, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in the United States and by [[Sony Pictures Releasing|Columbia TriStar Film Distributors International]] in worldwide territories. It received generally positive reviews and earned $433.4{{nbsp}}million worldwide, finishing its theatrical run as the [[2003 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh-highest-grossing film of 2003]]. A sequel, ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'', was released in 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nSeveral years after destroying [[Cyberdyne Systems]],{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991)}} [[John Connor]] has been living as a nomad following the death of his mother, [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah]], to hide from the malevolent artificial intelligence [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]], despite a war between humans and machines not happening in 1997, as foretold. Unable to locate John in the past, Skynet sends the [[T-X]], an advanced prototype shapeshifting [[Terminator (character concept)|Terminator]] made of virtually impervious liquid metal, back in time to John's present <!-- Date is not explicitly mentioned in the film -->in Los Angeles, to instead kill his future allies in the human resistance. The human resistance sends back another reprogrammed [[Terminator (character)|T-101 Terminator]], a less-advanced metal endoskeleton covered in living human flesh, to protect John and his future wife Kate Brewster.\n\nAfter killing other targets, the T-X locates the pair at an animal hospital where Kate works. John becomes the T-X's primary target, but the Terminator helps him and Kate escape, taking them to a [[mausoleum]] where John's mother is supposedly interred. Inside her vault, they find a weapons cache left at Sarah's request in case [[Terminator (franchise)#Judgment Day|Judgment Day]] was not averted and the Terminators returned. They escape from an armed battle with the police and fend off the pursuing T-X. The Terminator reveals that John and Sarah's actions only delayed Judgment Day and that Skynet's attack will occur that day; the Terminator intends to drive John and Kate to Mexico to escape the fallout when Skynet begins its [[nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]] at 6:18&nbsp;p.m. John orders the Terminator to take Kate and him to see her father, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Robert Brewster. The Terminator refuses, however when Kate also demands to see her father, the Terminator obeys. It is revealed that in the future, the Terminator killed John, after which Kate captured and reprogrammed the Terminator and sent it back in time.\n\nMeanwhile, General Brewster is supervising the development of Skynet for Cyber Research Systems (CRS), which also develops autonomous weapons. The [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]]{{efn|The Chairman is referred to as ''Admiral James T. Morrison'' in the novelization by [[David Hagberg]]. In the film the character is unnamed.}} pressures him to activate Skynet to stop an anomalous [[computer virus]] from invading [[Server (computing)|servers]] worldwide. General Brewster discovers too late that the virus was Skynet slowly becoming [[self-awareness|self-aware]]. John and Kate arrive too late to stop Skynet from being activated. The T-X fatally injures General Brewster and activates the CRS weaponized machines, which kill the employees. Before he dies, General Brewster gives Kate and John the location of what John believes is Skynet's system core. The pair head for the tarmac to take General Brewster's single-engine plane to Crystal Peak, a facility built inside the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. After a battle, the T-X severely damages the Terminator, reprogramming it to kill John, and pursues John and Kate through the CRS facility. When a [[particle accelerator]] is activated, it magnetically binds the T-X to the equipment. The still-conscious Terminator struggles to control its outer functions. As it prepares to kill John, he urges the Terminator to choose between its conflicting programming; it deliberately forces a shutdown of its corrupted system, enabling the pair's escape. Shortly after they leave, the Terminator's system [[reboot]]s. Meanwhile, the T-X escapes the accelerator and resumes pursuit.\n\nAfter John and Kate reach Crystal Peak, the T-X arrives by helicopter. Before it can attack, the Terminator arrives in a second helicopter and crashes into and crushes the T-X. The T-X pulls itself from the wreckage, losing its legs, and attempts to drag itself inside the bunker to follow the pair. The Terminator holds the bunker door open long enough for the pair to lock them inside then uses its last hydrogen fuel cell to destroy both itself and the T-X.\n\nJohn and Kate discover that Crystal Peak is not Skynet's core, but rather a nuclear [[fallout shelter]] and command facility for government and military officials. Having no core, Skynet has become a part of [[cyberspace]] after becoming self-aware. Judgment Day begins as Skynet fires nuclear missiles worldwide, starting a [[nuclear holocaust]] that kills billions. The pair begin receiving radio transmissions on the emergency equipment; John tentatively assumes command by answering radio calls, and they reluctantly accept their fate.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Terminator (franchise) characters|l1=List of ''Terminator'' characters}}\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as the [[Terminator (character)|Terminator]].\n* [[Nick Stahl]] as [[John Connor]].

Instead, he wanted to talk to the producers about his political interests, including a potential candidacy as [[Governor of California]] in the [[California gubernatorial election, 2002|2002 election]]. However, pre-production was rolling along, with the screenplay nearly finished and set deals for both merchandising and distribution. Schwarzenegger postponed his gubernatorial plans, which eventually came into fruition with the [[2003 California gubernatorial recall election]]. Instead, the actor combined production of the film with the promotion of [[California Proposition 49 (2002)|Proposition 49]], which advocated increased [[extracurricular activity]] in California schools.

During the scene, Schwarzenegger's Terminator hangs on to the crane arm as it is swung around, smashing him into a glass building and a passing fire truck. Fourteen cameras were used for the shot in which he crashes through a glass building, as the film crew would only have one chance to film it, which was the case with many of the film's stunts.

The scene required several repeated shots of the same area with the use of controlled camera movements that were the same for each take.<ref name=CR/> Another difficult scene depicts the T-X's liquid metal exterior peeling off to reveal her endoskeleton. The visual effects team took six months to develop a method that would adequately simulate the scene. [[Pablo Helman]], visual effects supervisor for ILM, said, \"We had no application for creating and controlling streams of liquid metal, so we had to begin by determining the density, weight, shape and mass of this material, and how it would move under these conditions.
