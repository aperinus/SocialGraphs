Directed by [[Kelly Makin]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy|url=https://www.timeout.com/movies/kids-in-the-hall-brain-candy|access-date=2021-04-11|website=Time Out Worldwide|language=en}}</ref> and filmed in [[Toronto]], it followed the five-season run of their television series ''[[The Kids in the Hall (TV series)|The Kids in the Hall]]'', which had been successful in both [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].\n\n== Premise and characters ==\nThe five-man team plays all of the major characters and many of the bit parts. The film was written by four of the five members of the troupe, along with [[Norm Hiscock]]; the troupe's fifth member, [[Dave Foley]], had quit the troupe and was already working as a cast member on ''[[NewsRadio]]'', but was contractually obligated to be in the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/entertainment/movies/the-kids-in-the-hall-prepare-to-revisit-their-darkest-chapter-with-brain-candy-live-read-in-toronto|title=The Kids in the Hall prepare to revisit their 'darkest chapter' with Brain Candy live read in Toronto|website=nationalpost}}</ref> Foley also plays fewer characters in the film than the other four members. [[Brendan Fraser]] and [[Janeane Garofalo]] have cameos in the film, Garofalo's being almost entirely absent from the final cut.\n\nThe film is about the introduction of a powerful [[antidepressant]], GLeeMONEX. The drug is rushed into production to help the ailing Roritor Pharmaceuticals and becomes an overnight media sensation. Those involved in the early stages of GLeeMONEX \u2013 the scientists, marketing arm and several early users \u2013 are followed, right up through the troubling [[coma]]-like side effect of being stuck in their happiest memory.\n\n* Marv (Dave Foley) is Roritor's assistant. Despite their seemingly close relationship, he actually dislikes Roritor to the point that his happiest memory is urinating into his boss's latte (Roritor's happiest moment, ironically, is drinking the concoction).\n* Alice ([[Bruce McCulloch]]) is a fellow scientist and apparent love interest of Chris. She eventually watches from a distance as he slips away into celebrity.\n* Grivo (Bruce McCulloch) is a rock star famous for his bleak and pessimistic rock as well as a general indifference toward his audience, fame, and music. After taking the drug, Grivo switches to jangly, upbeat [[pop music]]; his new song \"Happiness Pie\" becomes an anthem for the post-GLeeMONEX world and wins a \"World Music Video Award\" for it (much to the disappointment of the former fans of his moody angst music).\n* Chris Cooper ([[Kevin McDonald]], Jason Barr, younger) is the inventor of the drug and main protagonist of the film. He is motivated by the clumsy [[suicide]] of his father (also played by McDonald) to create a cure for [[clinical depression]] but quickly gets swept up in the resulting fame.\n* Don Roritor ([[Mark McKinney]]) heads Roritor Pharmaceuticals, founded on his invention of the drug Stummies (likely a play on [[Tums]] or [[Rolaids]]). He has a close but contentious relationship with his spineless assistant, Marv. (Roritor's speaking style is openly derived from McKinney's impersonation of producer [[Lorne Michaels]].)\n* Mrs. Hurdicure ([[Scott Thompson (comedian)|Scott Thompson]]) is an old woman who initially is severely depressed and an early test subject for GLeeMONEX (referred to as \"Patient 957\"). Her happiest memory is shown to be a brief and obligatory [[Christmas]] visit from her son, played by [[Dave Foley]]. The drug quickly whips her out of the depression, but she inevitably becomes the first victim of its side effect. She is also the test subject for its antidote, a depressant.\n* Wally Terzinsky (Scott Thompson) is a husband, father, and [[the closet|closeted]] [[homosexual]]. Wally [[masturbation|masturbates]] to [[gay pornography]], frequents public [[gay bathhouse|bath houses]], and was sexually active with men during his military service \u2013 but remains unaware of his [[sexual orientation]]. He is prescribed GLeeMONEX by a frustrated therapist, (Dave Foley) (\"You're gay. I know it, your family knows it... ''dogs'' know it!\"). His happiest memory is a [[homoeroticism|homoerotic]] [[Canadian Army|Army]] mission fantasized by Wally while being chewed out by his [[drill instructor]] (Mark McKinney). Wally finds himself standing considerably closer to his drill instructor when through fantasizing. Shortly after this, he finally admits (via song and dance) that he is in fact, homosexual.\n\nSome characters from the television series appear briefly in ''Brain Candy''. Among those who do are the \"[[white trash]] couple,\" the cops, Cancer Boy (see below), talk show host Nina Bedford (introduced in the show as \"Nina Spudkneeyak\"), Raj & Lacey, Melanie, Bellini, and the bigoted cab driver (who narrates the film).\n\n* Ginny Hurdicure ([[Kathryn Greenwood]])\n* Raymond's kid (Amy Smith)\n* Raymond's kid ([[Lachlan Murdoch (actor)|Lachlan Murdoch]])\n* Cooper's groupie ([[Nicole de Boer]])\n* Cooper's groupie ([[Krista Bridges]])\n* Wally Jr. (Christopher Redman)\n\n== Controversy ==\nThe movie received negative feedback due to the Cancer Boy character. Originally appearing in the final episode of the TV show, in a sketch that satirized the idea of being as offensive as possible, Cancer Boy is played by [[Bruce McCulloch]] dressed in a bald cap, with pale white makeup, using a wheelchair. He relays depressing information with a cheerful smile and releases a hit pop single entitled \"Whistle When You're Low\". Many found the character to be in exceedingly poor taste.<ref name=\"Maslin\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mrcranky.com/movies/kidsinthehall.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060610103518/http://mrcranky.com/movies/kidsinthehall.html|url-status=dead|title=Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy : Mr. Cranky Rates the Movies : Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy |archive-date=June 10, 2006}}</ref>  [[Paramount Pictures]] had fought extensively with the troupe to cut the character from the film, to no avail.

Bruce McCulloch came up with ''Brain Candy'' at the studio's request for something more marketable.\n\nTwo endings were filmed, with the relatively more upbeat conclusion making the final cut. In the alternate version, [[Dave Foley]] plays a crazed activist who leads a militant movement against GLeeMONEX. Chris Cooper, unable to cope with the mayhem his drug has created, decides to take it himself, and ends up lapsing into a coma. The unused ending has not been officially released, but a leaked workprint was widely traded among fans on the internet during the late 1990s.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Brain Candy - Music From the Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     =\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = April 9, 1996\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Movie Soundtrack\n| length     = 52:28\n| label      = [[Matador Records|Matador]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}} [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r233516|pure_url=yes}} link]\n}}\nA soundtrack album was released the Tuesday prior to the film's release.
