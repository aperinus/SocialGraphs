The screenplay by [[Peter Morgan]] was adapted from [[Philippa Gregory]]\u2019s [[The Other Boleyn Girl|2001 novel of the same name]]. It is a fictionalised account of the lives of 16th-century aristocrats [[Mary Boleyn]], one-time mistress of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]], and her sister, [[Anne Boleyn|Anne]], who became the monarch's ill-fated second wife, though the film does not represent history accurately.\n\nProduction studio [[BBC Films]] also owns the rights to adapt the 2006 sequel novel, ''[[The Boleyn Inheritance]]'', which tells the story of [[Anne of Cleves]], [[Catherine Howard]] and [[Jane Boleyn, Viscountess Rochford|Jane Parker]].<ref>Mitchell, Wendy (9 March 2007). \"[http://www.screendaily.com/united-kingdom-a-royal-welcome/4031354.article A royal welcome]\". ''Screen International'' (Emap Media).</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]'s marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]] is troubled as she has not produced a living male heir to the throne, having only one surviving child, [[Mary I of England|Princess Mary]]. [[Mary Boleyn]] marries [[William Carey (courtier)|William Carey]]. After the festivities, [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk]] and his brother-in-law [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn]] plot to install Thomas' eldest daughter, [[Anne Boleyn|Anne]], as the king's mistress, with the hope that she will bear him a son and improve the family's wealth and status, much to the disgust of Anne's mother, Lady [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Elizabeth]]. Despite knowing that being a mistress will damage her chances of a high-ranking marriage, a reluctant Anne agrees to please her father and uncle.\n\nWhile visiting the Boleyn estate, Henry is injured in a hunting accident indirectly caused by Anne. Urged by her scheming uncle, Mary nurses Henry. Henry becomes smitten and invites her to court, to which Mary and her husband reluctantly agree, fully aware of what will be expected of her. Mary and Anne become [[lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]] to Queen Catherine, and Henry sends William Carey abroad on an assignment. Separated from her husband, Mary begins a passionate affair with the king and finds herself falling in love with him. Anne secretly marries the nobleman [[Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland|Henry Percy]], although he is already betrothed to Lady [[Mary Percy, Countess of Northumberland|Mary Talbot]]. Anne confides in her brother, [[George Boleyn, 2nd Viscount Rochford|George Boleyn]], about the marriage. Overjoyed, George proceeds to tell Mary. Fearing Anne will ruin their family, Mary alerts her father and uncle. They confront Anne, forcibly annul the marriage, and exile her to France.\n\nMary eventually becomes pregnant with Henry's child. Her family receives new grants and estates, their debts are paid, and Henry arranges George's marriage to [[Jane Boleyn, Viscountess Rochford|Jane Parker]]. When Mary nearly suffers a miscarriage, she is confined to bed until the child is born. Norfolk recalls Anne to England and is tasked to keep Henry's attention from wandering to another rival while Mary is confined. Believing that Mary betrayed her solely to increase her status, a revenge-driven Anne starts seducing Henry herself. When Mary gives birth to a son, [[Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon|Henry Carey]], Thomas and Norfolk are thrilled, but the celebration is short-lived as Anne tells the king that the boy is still a bastard who can never inherit the throne. She also states that for her to accept his advances, he must no longer bed his wife and stop talking to Mary completely. This infuriates Norfolk, as Henry refuses to acknowledge the baby as his heir, but later changes his mind when Anne reveals her intent to give the king a legitimate son. At her request, Henry has Mary exiled to the countryside, leaving her heartbroken. Her grief only grows when her husband dies of the [[sweating sickness]], leaving her a widow.\n\nAnne further manipulates Henry into breaking from the Catholic Church when the Pope refuses to annul his marriage to Queen Catherine. A smitten Henry succumbs to her demands, declares himself [[Supreme Head]] of the Church of England, gets [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Thomas Wolsey]] to annul the marriage and Catherine is banished from court. Having fulfilled her requests, Henry comes to Anne's chambers, but she still refuses to have sex with him until they are married (not wanting to give birth to a son out of wedlock). Overcome with both rage and lust, Henry brutally rapes her. While deeply traumatized by the assault, a now pregnant Anne marries Henry to please her family and becomes the new Queen of England. Mary is recalled to court to serve Anne and the sisters form an uneasy truce for the sake of their family. Later on, Mary meets [[William Stafford (courtier)|William Stafford]], a financially modest, but kind soldier and a romance eventually blossoms between the two.\n\nDespite the birth of a healthy daughter, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], Henry blames Anne for not immediately producing a son. As queen, she is greatly hated by the public who denounce her as a witch while as a wife, Henry starts to despise her and begins courting [[Jane Seymour]] in secret. As her marriage falls apart, Anne becomes increasingly depressed and paranoid.\n\nAfter she miscarries a son, a hysterical Anne begs George to impregnate her again out of fear of being burned at the stake for witchcraft. At first, George reluctantly agrees, seeing it not only as Anne's only chance for survival, but their entire family's. However, the pair do not go through with the act. Unbeknownst to them though, George's neglected wife, Jane, under orders from Norfolk to spy on Anne, witnesses enough of the encounter to become suspicious. She reports her findings and the two are arrested. Despite the lack of any solid evidence, Anne and George are immediately found guilty by a biased jury and sentenced to death for treason, adultery and incest. A devastated Lady Elizabeth disowns both her husband and brother, vowing never to forgive them for the pain and destruction they brought upon all of her children solely out of their own quest for power.\n\nLeaving her children with Stafford, Mary rushes back to London but arrives too late to save George, who is beheaded in front of their horrified father. Henry agrees to meet with her and she pleads with him to spare Anne's life, stating that her sister is her other half. Due to him saying he would never harm any part of her, Mary believes Anne has been spared and leaves to see her right before the scheduled execution. The two sisters truly reconcile and Anne asks Mary to look after Elizabeth if anything should happen to her.\n\nAs the execution begins, Mary watches Anne make her final speech, waiting for the cancellation. A messenger then delivers a letter from the king to her, revealing his decision to have Anne executed after all and warning her to never return to his court again. Mary can only watch in horror as her sister is beheaded. She fulfills her final promise to Anne and immediately leaves court with the toddler Elizabeth.\n\nA textual epilogue reveals Thomas died two years after Anne and George's executions while Norfolk was imprisoned and the [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey|next]] [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|three]] generations of his family executed for treason; Mary married Stafford and lived out her days away from court, and Elizabeth went on to rule England for over forty years as queen.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as [[Anne Boleyn]]. Portman was attracted to the role because it was a character that she \"hadn\u2019t played before\", and describes Anne as \"strong, yet she can be vulnerable and she's ambitious and calculating and will step on people but also feels remorse for it\". One month before filming began, Portman started taking daily classes to master the English accent under dialect coach Jill McCulloch, who also stayed on set throughout the filming.<ref>{{cite web | title = Natalie Portman The Other Boleyn Girl Interview | publisher = Girl.com.au | url = http://www.girl.com.au/natalie-portman-the-other-boleyn-girl-interview.htm | access-date = June 7, 2009}}</ref> This was her second film to use her English accent after ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]''. Natalie Portman wore hair extensions for the long hair because her hair was short at the time after shaving her head for ''V for Vendetta''.\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Mary Boleyn]].\n* [[Eric Bana]] as [[Henry VIII of England]]. Bana commented that he was surprised upon being offered the role, and describes the character of Henry as \"a man who was somewhat juvenile and driven by passion and greed\", and that he interpreted the character as \"this man who was involved in an incredibly intricate, complicated situation, largely through his own doing\".<ref>{{cite web | last = Fischer | first = Paul | title = Bana Takes on Kings and Icons | publisher = Film Monthly.com | url = http://www.filmmonthly.com/paul_fischer_exclusive/bana_takes_on_kings_and_icons.html | access-date = June 7, 2009}}</ref> In preparation for the role, Bana relied mostly on the script to come up with his own version of the character, and he \"deliberately stayed away\" from other portrayals of Henry in films because he found it \"too confusing and restricting\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview: Eric Bana, The other Boleyn Girl |publisher=Get Frank |url=http://www.getfrank.co.nz/interview-eric-bana-the-other-boleyn-girl/ |access-date=June 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221095627/http://getfrank.co.nz/interview-eric-bana-the-other-boleyn-girl/ |archive-date=February 21, 2009 }}</ref>\n* [[Jim Sturgess]] as [[George Boleyn, 2nd Viscount Rochford|George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford]]. Though the three siblings are all very tight-knit, George and Anne are closest. George supports and loves Anne for her rebellious and unconventional attitude. He is forced to marry [[Jane Boleyn, Viscountess Rochford|Jane Parker]]. George is often viewed as the most vulnerable and probably the kindest of the siblings.\n* [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] as [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire and Ormond]]\n* [[Mark Rylance]] as [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn, Earl of Wiltshire and Ormond]]\n* [[David Morrissey]] as [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk]]\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as [[William Carey (courtier)|William Carey]]\n* [[Oliver Coleman]] as [[Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland|Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland]]\n* [[Ana Torrent]] as [[Catherine of Aragon]]\n* [[Eddie Redmayne]] as [[William Stafford (courtier)|William Stafford]]\n* [[Juno Temple]] as [[Jane Boleyn, Viscountess Rochford|Jane Parker]]\n* Iain Mitchell as [[Thomas Cromwell]]\n* Corinne Galloway as [[Jane Seymour]]\n* Constance Stride as [[Mary I of England|young Mary Tudor]]\n* [[Maisie Smith]] as [[Elizabeth I of England|young Elizabeth Tudor]]\n* [[Alfie Allen]] as the King's Messenger\n* [[Andrew Garfield]] as [[Francis Weston]]\n\n== Production ==\nMuch of the filming took place in [[Kent]], England, though [[Hever Castle]] was not used, despite being the original household of Thomas Boleyn and family from 1505 to 1539. The Baron's Hall at [[Penshurst Place]] featured, as did [[Dover Castle]], which stood in for the [[Tower of London]] in the film, and [[Knole House]] in [[Sevenoaks]] was used in several scenes.<ref name=\"Kent Film Office\">{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/2008/02/the-other-boleyn-girl-2008/|title=Kent Film Office The Other Boleyn Girl Film Focus}}</ref><ref name=\"knole\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/content/image_galleries/the_other_boleyn_girl_2008_gallery.shtml Gallery: The Other Boleyn Girl] BBC Kent website, accessed 7 April 2019</ref> The home of the Boleyns was represented by [[Great Chalfield Manor]] in [[Wiltshire]], and other scenes were filmed at locations in [[Derbyshire]], including [[Cave Dale]], [[Haddon Hall]], [[Dovedale]] and North Lees Hall near [[Hathersage]].<ref name=\"derbyshire\">[http://www.visitpeakdistrict.com/be-inspired/boleyn-girl.aspx ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219173747/http://www.visitpeakdistrict.com/be-inspired/boleyn-girl.aspx |date=2011-02-19 }} Ely cathedral was a major location for the film</ref>\n\nDover Castle was transformed into the Tower of London for the execution scenes of George and Anne Boleyn. Knole House was the setting for many of the film's London night scenes and the inner courtyard doubles for the entrance of Whitehall Palace where the grand arrivals and departures were staged. The Tudor Gardens and Baron's Hall at Penshurst Place were transformed into the interiors of Whitehall Palace, including the scenes of Henry's extravagant feast.<ref name=\"Kent Film Office\"/>\n\n== Historical accuracy ==\n{{Main|The Other Boleyn Girl#Historical accuracy}}\n\nHistorian [[Alex von Tunzelmann]] criticised ''The Other Boleyn Girl'' for its portrayal of the Boleyn family and Henry VIII, citing factual errors. She stated, \"In real life, by the time Mary Boleyn started her affair with Henry, she had already enjoyed a passionate liaison with his great rival, King [[Fran\u00e7ois I]] of France. Rather ungallantly, Fran\u00e7ois called her 'my hackney', explaining that she was fun to ride. Chucked out of France by his irritated wife, Mary sashayed back to England and casually notched up her second kingly conquest. The film's portrayal of this Boleyn girl as a shy, blushing damsel could hardly be further from the truth.\"<ref name=\"Tunzelmann\">{{Cite web |last=von Tunzelmann |first=Alex |title=The Other Boleyn Girl: Hollyoaks in fancy dress |work=The Guardian |date=August 6, 2008 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/07/1 |access-date=May 31, 2013}}</ref> She further criticised the depiction of Anne as a \"manipulative vixen\" and Henry as \"nothing more than a gullible sex addict in wacky shoulder pads\".<ref name=\"Tunzelmann\"/> The film presents other historical inaccuracies, such as the statement by a character that, through marrying Henry Percy, Anne Boleyn would become Duchess of Northumberland, a title that was only created in the reign of Henry's son, Edward VI. Also, it places Anne's time in the French court after her involvement with Percy, something that occurred before the affair. On top of that, Anne was portrayed inaccurately  as the older sister in the movie, in real life she was Mary's younger sister.\nIn the film, Thomas Boleyn stated Anne was in France for a couple months. In real life Anne was in France for seven years.\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== Theatrical ===\nThe film was first released in theatres on February 29, 2008, though its world premiere was held at the 58th [[Berlin International Film Festival]] held on February 7\u201317, 2008.<ref>{{cite web | title = Berlinale Archive Annual Archives 2008 Programme | publisher = [[Berlin International Film Festival]] | url = http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2008/02_programm_2008/02_Filmdatenblatt_2008_20082226.php | access-date = June 17, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last = Blaney |first = Martin | title = Berlinaleadds world premieres including The Other Boleyn Girl |date = January 18, 2008 | publisher = [[Screen International]] | url = http://www.screendaily.com/berlinaleadds-world-premieres-including-the-other-boleyn-girl/4036663.article | access-date = June 17, 2009}}</ref> The film earned $9,442,224 in the United Kingdom,<ref name=bomojo>{{cite web | title = The Other Boleyn Girl (2008) - International Box Office Results | publisher = [[Box Office Mojo]] | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&id=otherboleyngirl.htm | access-date = May 16, 2009}}</ref> and $26,814,957 in the United States and Canada.

Mining relatively familiar material here, and dramatising highly dubious scenarios, [Peter Morgan] is unable to make the set-pieces seem revelatory or tart ... In the end, ''The Other Boleyn Girl'' is more anodyne than it has any right to be. It can't decide whether to be serious or comic. It promises an erotic charge that it never carries off, inducing dismissive laughs from the audience for its soft-focus love scenes soundtracked by swooning violins. It is tasteful, but unappetising.\"<ref>{{cite web | last = Sandhu | first = Sukhdev | title = Film reviews: The Other Boleyn Girl and Garage | publisher = The Daily Telegraph | date = March 7, 2008 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/03/07/bfboleyn107.xml | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080310161449/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/03/07/bfboleyn107.xml | url-status = dead | archive-date = March 10, 2008 | access-date = May 16, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[The Other Boleyn Girl (2003 film)]]''\n* [[Anne Boleyn in popular culture]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/theotherboleyngirl}}\n* {{IMDb title|0467200|The Other Boleyn Girl}}\n* {{Tcmdb title|650314|The Other Boleyn Girl}}\n* {{Amg movie|353424|The Other Boleyn Girl}}\n* {{Mojo title|otherboleyngirl|The Other Boleyn Girl}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|other_boleyn_girl|The Other Boleyn Girl}}\n\n{{Justin Chadwick}}\n{{Peter Morgan}}\n{{Philippa Gregory}}\n{{Anne Boleyn}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Other Boleyn Girl, The}}\n[[Category:2008 biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s historical drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s historical romance films]]\n[[Category:2008 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:2008 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:2008 films]]\n[[Category:American biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:American historical drama films]]\n[[Category:American historical romance films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:BBC Film films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about English royalty]]\n[[Category:British biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:British historical drama films]]\n[[Category:British historical romance films]]\n[[Category:British romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Anne Boleyn]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Catherine of Aragon]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Elizabeth I]]\n[[Category:Films about Henry VIII]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Alison Owen]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Paul Cantelon]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Elstree Film Studios]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Berkshire]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Cambridgeshire]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Derbyshire]]\n[[Category:Films shot in East Sussex]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Gloucestershire]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Kent]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Somerset]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Wiltshire]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Peter Morgan]]\n[[Category:Focus Features films]]\n[[Category:Incest in film]]\n[[Category:Mary Boleyn]]\n[[Category:Relativity Media films]]\n[[Category:Romance films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films about sisters]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Justin Chadwick]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]"}]}}}}
