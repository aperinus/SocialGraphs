It is the first installment of the ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'' tetralogy, based on the anime television series ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]''. The story, which  is set in the futuristic city of Tokyo-3 fifteen years after a planetary catastrophe known as the Second Impact, focuses on [[Shinji Ikari]], a boy who is recruited by the special agency Nerv to pilot a giant mecha known as an [[Evangelion (mecha)|Eva]] unit and fight, along with fellow pilot [[Rei Ayanami]], against a mysterious species named [[List of Angels in Neon Genesis Evangelion|Angels]]. The film features the same cast of voice actors from the original series, including [[Megumi Ogata]] as Shinji Ikari, [[Megumi Hayashibara]] as Rei Ayanami, and [[Kotono Mitsuishi]] as [[Misato Katsuragi]].\n\n''Evangelion: 1.0'' was planned to be the first installment of a three-part remake of ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' with about one hundred fifty new cuts; during the production, however, the staff could not reuse the original drawings from the series and had to begin production from scratch. As production went on, the project began to deviate from the original series, introducing differences to the plot and characterization of the characters. Hideaki Anno was joined in the direction by [[Kazuya Tsurumaki]] and Masayuki, both of whom were assistant directors of the original series. The storyboards were handled by [[Shinji Higuchi]] and [[Tomoki Kyoda]].\n\nThe film, which retraces the plot of the first six episodes of the series, enjoyed a positive reception in [[Japan]], grossing about two billion yen and generating considerable revenue for the home video market. Abroad, ''Evangelion: 1.0'' received a more polarized reception, although generally positive; critics described it as too derivative of the classic series and claimed that it cut important details, while others praised its direction, soundtrack and plot, with particular attention to its use of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] graphics. The feature film also won accolades, receiving awards at, among others, the [[Animation Kobe]] and [[Tokyo International Anime Fair]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2015, fifteen years after a global cataclysm known as the Second Impact, fourteen-year-old [[Shinji Ikari]] is summoned to Tokyo-3 by his estranged father [[Gendo Ikari|Gendo]], the commander of the paramilitary organization Nerv. Shinji gets caught in the crossfire between [[United Nations|UN]] forces and a mysterious being called an [[List of Angels in Neon Genesis Evangelion#Sachiel|Angel]], but is rescued by Captain [[Misato Katsuragi]], who brings him to Nerv headquarters. There, Gendo demands Shinji to pilot [[Evangelion (mecha)#Evangelion Unit-01|Evangelion Unit 01]], a giant, humanoid bio-machine, against the Angel. Shinji concedes when Gendo has [[Rei Ayanami]], a wounded Evangelion pilot, prepared to be sent out instead. Shinji loses consciousness during the fight due to injuries inflicted by the Angel on Unit 01, as Evangelion units sympathetically reflect the pain of injuries they sustain onto their pilots. Unit 01 autonomously reactivates and wins the fight, destroying the Angel. After the battle, Misato becomes Shinji's guardian and he is enrolled in a local middle school. When [[List of Angels in Neon Genesis Evangelion#Shamshel|another Angel]] arrives, Shinji's classmates [[List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters#Toji Suzuhara|Toji Suzuhara]] and [[List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters#Kensuke Aida|Kensuke Aida]] sneak out of their emergency shelter to watch the battle, but the Angel throws Unit 01 onto a mountainside, nearly crushing them. Misato has the two take cover in Unit 01's cockpit and orders Shinji to retreat, but he ignores the orders and destroys the enemy with Unit 01's knife. After Misato scolds him for insubordination, Shinji wanders off and is recovered by Nerv agents before being brought back to her.\n\nThe [[List of Angels in Neon Genesis Evangelion#Ramiel|Sixth Angel]] appears, but when Shinji is sent out to attack it in Unit 01, the Angel fires a powerful laser, critically injuring him, before beginning to drill into Tokyo-3 to reach Nerv headquarters. He wakes up from a coma several hours later, and Rei tells him that she will take his place for the operation to stop the Angel, and leaves to do it alone. Misato shows Shinji what the Angels are trying to reach: a white anthropomorphic giant kept at the bottom of Nerv headquarters, the [[List of Angels in Neon Genesis Evangelion#Lilith|Second Angel, Lilith]], which upon contact with one of the attacking Angels will result in the deaths of all of the life on Earth. Shinji agrees to pilot Unit 01 alongside Rei in [[Evangelion (mecha)#Evangelion Unit-00|Unit 00]], wielding an experimental [[positron]] cannon, which requires the entire electrical power output of Japan to power, like a [[sniper rifle]], and successfully destroys the Angel. Rei is nearly killed defending Shinji from the Angel's return fire, but he saves her by cooling Unit 00 in water and prying open its cockpit using Unit 01's knife. Rei, normally cold and emotionless, shares a smile with him.\n\nOn the surface of the Moon, a boy named [[Kaworu Nagisa]] awakens from one of nine coffin-like containers arranged on the ground. In a pit in front of him, surrounded by construction equipment and scaffolding, is [[Evangelion (mecha)#Evangelion Mark.06|an unidentified giant]] wearing a purple seven-eyed mask and wrapped in white bandages. A black monolith appears through which he and [[List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters#Keel Lorenz|Seele 01]] engage in a cryptic conversation. Looking towards Earth, Kaworu says that \"the third one\" has not changed and that he looks forward to meeting Shinji.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Character\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Japanese<ref name=BVA>{{cite web|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/movies/Evangelion-1-0-You-Are-Not-Alone/|title=Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone (2008)|publisher=Behind The Voice Actors|access-date=21 November 2021}}</ref>\n! colspan=\"2\"|English\n|-\n!

He gave himself the purpose of ''Gundamizing'' ''Evangelion'', expanding the franchise, possibly with the contribution of new and young authors; initially having in mind a title in the wake of ''G Evangelion'', he tried to create a work capable of completely overturning the entire concept of ''Evangelion'', similar to what ''[[G Gundam]]'' did for Tomino's franchise.<ref name=\"Anno1\" /> He believed that animation was at a standstill, perceiving the need to produce \"a work that would appeal to middle and high school-aged men, who quickly grow away from anime\", and raise the general level of animated productions.<ref name=Booklet>{{cite book|language=ja|publisher=Khara|date=2008|title=Evangelion: 1.0 Official Booklet}}</ref> In children's animation, Anno found a wide range of content available, such as [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s and [[Studio Ghibli]]'s films, but for the older age groups he only noted ''Gundam''; as Tomino's franchise had reached popularity beyond the boundaries of the [[otaku]] fanbase, Anno set himself the goal of doing something similar.<ref name=\"Anno1\" />\n\nAnno did not rely on [[Gainax]], the studio that produced ''Evangelion'' ten years earlier, to make the film.

At the beginning of production, Anno asked Tsurumaki what he would like to do after finishing ''[[Diebuster]]'': work on an ''Evangelion''-related project, or work on a new project about a famous anime. While confused by the question, he instinctively answered ''Evangelion''. If Tsurumaki had refused, Anno was prepared to offer the role of assistant director to someone else, but Tsurumaki eventually accepted, albeit with reservations. Tsurumaki had regrets about the sixth episode of ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'', which after the storyboard \"was ordered by another company, and Gainax had no control over it\", and felt he could address the issues he had with the episode.<ref name=Tsurumaki1>{{harvp|Khara|2008|loc=\u9db4\u5dfb \u548c\u54c9 interview: \u53c2\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u304b\u3089\u306b\u306f\u4fa1\u5024\u3042\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3092}}</ref> Meanwhile, \u014ctsuki contacted Masayuki in February 2006.

The initial project also called for a film to be released every six months, though the films would be a quick, easily produced year and a half time commitment.

During this time, Higuchi spoke with [[Kenji Kamiyama]], director of ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]''. During the production, Higuchi drew heavily from Kamiyama's work, inspired by the camera tricks and directorial style Kamiyama used in digital animation.

As elements from this original vision could be seen in the episodes of the series which were centered in the film, Tsurumaki elected to not write those elements back in. It was particularly difficult to introduce elements of surprise, as ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth]]'' (1997) already served as a recap film of the series. Instead, he had to devise ways to make the audience understand that ''Evangelion: 1.0'' and the ''Rebuild'' tetralogy set out to tell a different story.<ref name=Tsurumaki6>{{harvp|Khara|2008|loc=\u9db4\u5dfb \u548c\u54c9 interview: \u30c8\u30fc\u30bf\u30eb\u306a\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u306e\u5370\u8c61\u3068\u306e\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9}}</ref> He and Anno also made it their goal to correctly represent Shinji and Misato's story, as well as Misato and Ritsuko's generation.<ref name=Suzuki3>{{harvp|Khara|2008|loc=\u9234\u6728 \u4fca\u4e8c interview: \u610f\u56f3\u3092\u304f\u307f\u3064\u3064\u5168\u4f53\u3092\u7d71\u4e00\u3059\u308b\u4f5c\u696d}}</ref>\n\nDuring the writing process, staff introduced more changes: passages or details were cut to streamline the plot, new scenes were introduced, and the characterization of certain characters had changed. For example, the Angels are not named; Masayuki stated that their names were excluded from the script because they simply were not used during the production and the staff had a hard time remembering them.<ref>{{harvp|Khara|2008|loc=\u6469\u7802\u96ea interview: Masayuki \u30ef\u30a4\u30c9\u3067TV\u306e\u5207\u308a\u8fd4\u3057\u306f\u6210\u7acb\u3057\u306a\u3044}}</ref> An example of a major change in characterization is Misato: after the initial scene, in which she behaves childishly under the influence of alcohol, she becomes more serious. Tsurumaki, however, thought that that would make her look boring, so he gave a more comic touch to the scenes in which she is present at the Nerv strategy meetings. In the scene where she shows the Angel Lilith to Shinji, Tsurumaki tried to represent her mature and adult side. This sequence was inserted to clarify the differences between ''Evangelion'' and the ''Rebuild'': in the original anime, the characters rarely touch each other's hands, since this would have complicated the work of the animators.<ref name=\"Tsurumaki6\" />\n\nTo Tsurumaki, ''Evangelion: 1.0'' was a story of growth, painting in the storyboard a clear picture of Shinji's evolution and adding a happy ending to the story. However, Anno changed the plot again, adding nuance because he thought Tsurumaki's idea went too far.<ref name=\"Tsurumaki2\" /> In its first half, ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' maintained a normal mecha story setting and then became mature and serious in the second half; to balance this, Anno added an adult and serious tone by introducing mature conversations between Ritsuko and Misato during all parts of the tetralogy. According to Tsurumaki, however, Shinji's character was not changed much compared to the classic series. He described the ''Rebuild'' as a kind of \"virtual war\", a type of game in which hypothetical scenarios are imagined from historical facts.<ref name=Tsurumaki6/> The scene in which Shinji escapes and gets on a train, introduced in the fourth episode of the series, was initially cut from the script; however, Tsurumaki pushed to introduce it again to better represent Tokyo-3.<ref name=Tsurumaki7>{{harvp|Khara|2008|loc=\u9db4\u5dfb \u548c\u54c9 interview: \u90fd\u5e02\u98a8\u666f\u63cf\u5199\u3068\u5f15\u3044\u305f\u753b\u3065\u304f\u308a}}</ref> Instead of the sequence in which Shinji meets his friend [[Kensuke Aida]] in the middle of the fields, also present in the fourth episode, a sequence in which Shinji wanders on a deserted highway at night was inserted, conceived by Kyoda.<ref name=Anno6/>\n\n===Design and scenography===\nHiroshi Kato, who had previously worked on ''Evangelion'', returned to work on the franchise as an art director in ''Evangelion: 1.0''. Kat\u014d also worked as production designer alongside Tatsuya Kushida of Bishou Inc. According to Kato, ideas set aside during the production of the television series due to lack of time were revived for the film. For example, the hatches of the Nerv Operations Command Center were originally marked with letters, such as W, X, and Y, to indicate the order to close in case of emergency, and this was recovered for the ''Rebuild'' saga.<ref name=Kato1>{{harvp|Khara|2008|loc=\u52a0\u85e4 \u6d69 interview: \u521d\u671f\u7a3f\u96c6\u306b\u6e96\u3058\u3066\u3044\u308bEVA\u306e\u65b0\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0}}</ref> Anno also had a particular eye on pylons, telephone poles, and traffic lights.<ref>{{harvp|Khara|2008|loc=\u52a0\u85e4 \u6d69 interview: \u63cf\u304d\u3053\u307f\u3088\u308a\u306f \u5149\u3001\u7a7a\u6c17\u611f\u3092\u91cd\u8996\u3059\u308b}}</ref> Khara called in Takeshi Takakura for design work; when he joined the staff, the content or structure of the work had not yet been decided, and Anno and the others did not know who to assign what to at first.

Given Shinji's characterization as a passive boy who simply reacts to the information or actions of other characters, Ogata found it difficult to act without the other performers in the other incarnations; however, she found it easier during the production of the ''Rebuild'' tetralogy as other voice actors returned to the room. Unlike the other performers, Anno did not give her instructions, instead telling her to act how she pleased. The performance was not easy, taking time for the voice actress to get into the spirit of the film. The first day in particular was tiring, and by the end she felt exhausted. In the scene where Shinji is attacked by the sixth Angel and is burned by the enemy, for example, she recorded a scream which caused a slight burn in her windpipe.<ref>{{harvp|Kadokawa Shoten|2007|pp=40-41}}</ref>\n* [[Akira Ishida]] reprised the character of Kaworu Nagisa. In the original series, Kaworu appeared only in the twenty-fourth episode, so his early presence served to make people understand that the ''Rebuild'' did not correspond to the ''Neon Genesis Evangelion''. During the recordings Anno gave him an explanation about Shinji and Kaworu's roles in the new tetralogy, so he based his interpretation on what he understood from the information he received from the director.<ref>{{harvp|Khara|2010|p=47}}</ref>\n* [[Megumi Hayashibara]] reprised the character of Rei Ayanami. The order of recording did not follow the order of events, but was done according to a very precise arrangement of scenes. Hayashibara had continued to dub Rei in the years between the classic series and the ''Rebuild'', but only for limited readings. The voice actress was therefore indifferent to the announcement of the ''Rebuild'' tetralogy, and only afterward did she enter the project. After an initial embarrassment, she was able to record quietly, without any hiccups or disturbances whatsoever. Anno gave her no specific instructions, exchanging only a few words with him during lunch breaks.<ref>{{harvp|Kadokawa Shoten|2007|pp=42-43}}</ref>\n* [[Kotono Mitsuishi]] returned to play Misato Katsuragi. Misato's character is twenty-nine years old, and due to the passage of time between recording lines for ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' and the ''Rebuild'' tetralogy was instructed to adopt a more youthful tone than in the series.<ref>{{harvp|Khara|2012|p=58}}</ref> Mitsuishi had also continued to voice her character, who died in the feature film ''The End of Evangelion,'' in video games''.'' According to Mitsuishi, this created another Misato in her mind, one that was far from the director's vision of the characters. Given the time that elapsed between the two interpretations of Misato, the actress initially tried to avoid a simple copy of the original version of the character, trying to recreate the spirit of the original one. In the end, despite the differences and different nuances, there were no major changes in terms of acting.<ref>{{harvp|Kadokawa Shoten|2007|p=44}}</ref>\n* [[Fumihiko Tachiki]] returned to play Gendo Ikari. At the time of recording lines for ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'', Tachiki had difficulty getting in touch with his character. With ''Evangelion: 1.0'', however, since his age was closer to Gendo's, he found things easier than before. The voice actor compared the feeling he experienced to a feeling of happiness, a happiness \"that only parents can feel for their children\".<ref>{{harvp|Khara|2012|p=63}}</ref>\n\n[[Sayaka \u014chara]] also participated in the film voicing background ads by unnamed operators, and would later continue acting in the ''Rebuild'' tetralogy by playing Sumire Nagara in ''[[Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo]]'' (2012).<ref>{{harvp|Khara|2012|p=72}}</ref>\n\n===Photography and sound===\nThe photography department was a key element in the film's production system.<ref name=Fukushi1>{{harvp|Khara|2008|loc=\u798f\u58eb \u4eab interview: \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u3067\u518d\u73fe\u81f3\u96e3\u306a\u5341\u4e8c\u5e74\u524d\u306e\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6}}</ref> T2 Studio's Toru Fukushi was chosen as the director of photography. He felt it was impossible to compete with ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'', which he watched for the first time while working on the ''Rebuild'' tetralogy and felt was the pinnacle of the celluloid era. He had difficulties during the photography process, feeling that despite his efforts much of the atmosphere and flavor of the original anime was lost as if there was \"an impassable wall\".<ref name=Fukushi1/> According to Fukushi, digital technology has the advantage of controlling all the elements, while eliminating chance, which he said was an important component of the process.<ref name=Fukushi1/> The digital format allowed for easier implementation of drawings, joining them to the backgrounds and superimposing the camera work done by the director. The characters and mecha processed through CG also went through a compositional stage with materials similar in type to rhodium-glass.<ref name=Booklet/> In the compositing stage, the staff made use of various types of effects, mostly filters and lighting effects such as blurring, wave glass (or irregular distortion), and multiple exposures. Other effects that were used were transmitted light, which strikes a subject from the top, para, and flare: with para, a portion of the surface appears to be coated with kerosene, while flare involves the insertion of diffused light.<ref name=Booklet/> The director did not initially give any particular guidelines on photography. For particular cuts, however, Fukushi went to Khara, where Anno and Tsurumaki sat next to him and made adjustments cut-by-cut without any clear policy.<ref>{{harvp|Khara|2008|loc=\u798f\u58eb \u4eab interview: \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u306e\u826f\u3055\u306f\u898b\u305f\u76ee\u3067\u716e\u8a70\u3081\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068}}</ref> Anno's tastes eventually emerged, and in the end, Fukushi spent most of his time in the director's presence adjusting paras and flares.<ref name=\"Fukushi3\">{{harvp|Khara|2008|loc=\u798f\u58eb \u4eab interview: \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u3067\u7d30\u304b\u304f\u8abf\u6574\u3067\u304d\u308b\u5149\u306e\u51e6\u7406}}</ref> Fukushi had to pay particular attention to the luminescent parts of the Eva-01, as they required a photographic effect inserted as a digital mask, with transmitted light and multiple exposures.<ref name=\"Booklet\" /> The upper part of the screen in the night battles was made darker, to emphasize the sense of immensity.

Noguchi had already worked on ''[[Renewal of Evangelion]]'', which entailed remastering the audio of the original series to [[5.1 surround sound]]. For the ''Renewal'' tetralogy, however, there were difficulties due to Anno's typical style of overlapping dialogue and sound information. At the beginning, Noguchi tried to subtract some sound information for ''Evangelion: 1.0'' to make the sound more understandable for viewers.<ref name=\"Noguchi1\">{{harvp|Khara|2008|loc=\u91ce\u53e3 \u900f interview: \u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u8d64\u304f\u632f\u308a\u304d\u3063\u305f\u30c0\u30d3\u30f3\u30b0\u4f5c\u696d}}</ref> He also fielded different requests from Anno, so he worked and edited until the last minute.<ref>{{harvp|Khara|2008|loc=\u91ce\u53e3 \u900f interview: \u7d30\u90e8\u3082\u5168\u4f53\u3082\u4e21\u65b9\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u5165\u308b}}</ref> At first, Noguchi thought he would simply copy the sounds of the TV series and extend them for a film release, but his plans lead to a much different result.

He based much of the material off of the sounds already present in ''Neon Genesis Evangelion''; for example, he gave the Angel Ramiel feminine vocals.
