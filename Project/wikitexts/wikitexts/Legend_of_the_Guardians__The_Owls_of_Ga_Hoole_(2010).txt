Based on the ''[[Guardians of Ga'Hoole]]'' book series by [[Kathryn Lasky]], the film was written by [[John Orloff]] and Emil Stern and features the voices of [[Helen Mirren]], [[Geoffrey Rush]], [[Jim Sturgess]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Emily Barclay]], [[Abbie Cornish]], [[Ryan Kwanten]], [[Anthony LaPaglia]], [[Miriam Margolyes]], [[Sam Neill]], [[Richard Roxburgh]], and [[David Wenham]]. An [[international co-production]] between the United States and Australia, the film was produced by [[Village Roadshow Pictures]] and [[Animal Logic]], following their success with the 2006 film ''[[Happy Feet]]''. In ''Legend of the Guardians'', Soren, who loves listening to stories, is kidnapped and brought by the Pure Ones to St. Aegolious Home for Orphaned Owls led by Metal Beak and Nyra where the owlets are brainwashed to becoming soldiers. Soren befriended Gylfie, and later escape the facility to find the Island of Ga'Hoole with new-found friends and together fight against the evil army.\n\n''Legend of the Guardians'' was theatrically released in [[RealD 3D]] and [[IMAX 3D]] in North America on September 24, 2010, and in Australia on September 30, 2010, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]; it was accompanied by a new 3D [[Looney Tunes]] cartoon entitled ''[[Fur of Flying]]''. The film grossed over $140 million worldwide against a budget of $80 million.  Critics praised its dark tone, visuals and voice acting, but criticized the screenplay and said it failed to live up to its potential.<ref name=rt/>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nSoren, a young owl, lives in the Tyto Forest with his family. Soren enjoys listening to his father's stories of the \"Guardians of Ga'Hoole,\" valiant warrior owls who fought the evil Pure Ones. Kludd, Soren's older brother, becomes jealous of Soren after they are taught how to fly and pushes him off a branch, causing them both to fall to the ground. The brothers are kidnapped by Jatt and Jutt, two owls who work for the Pure Ones, and taken to the St. Aegolius Home for Orphaned Owls. \n\nThe Pure Ones' queen, Nyra, announces that the owls will either become soldiers or pickers (owls who find \" flecks,\" bits of magnetic metal that are used to build a superweapon). While Kludd becomes a soldier, Soren and another owl named Gylfie become pickers and are put through a brainwashing process called \"moon-blinking,\" but they resist. A [[boreal owl]] named Grimble teaches them to fly and tells them to find the Great Tree of Ga'Hoole, but Nyra finds out and kills him. Soren and Gylfie escape and soon meet two more owls named Digger and Twilight. In their hollow, Soren reunites with Mrs. P, a blind snake who is his family's nest maid. She agrees to go with them and find the Guardians.\n\nThe owls fly towards the sea of [[Bass Strait|Hoolemere]] and reach the legendary shrine of the Guardians, guarded by an oracular [[echidna]] who helps the owls find the Island of Ga'Hoole. While flying, the band encounters a fierce storm and Digger's wings freeze, causing him to fall into the sea, but they are saved by Boron and Barran, the king and queen of the Guardians. They lead the party to the Great Tree of Ga'Hoole, where Soren tells the Guardians about the Pure Ones' plans. Boron sends a great grey owl called Allomere out with two scouts to investigate St. Aegolius.\n\nThe owls stay in the Tree of Ga'Hoole for a long time and are looked after by a young [[short-eared owl]] named Otulissa. One day, Soren learns that Ezylryb is really Lyze of Kiel, who fought and defeated Metal Beak, Nyra's mate. Allomere returns from his scouting mission with news that his two wingmen were killed in an ambush. He brings back two moon-blinked owlets, one of which is Soren's younger sister Eglantine. The Guardians prepare for battle and fly out towards St. Aegolius. When she finally snaps out of her trance, Eglantine tells Soren that it was Kludd who moon-blinked her and gave her to Allomere, confirming that Allomere is a traitor and that the Guardians are actually flying into a trap. The owls fly back to St. Aegolius where they find Metal Beak holding the Guardians captive in a machine powered by flecks and guarded by bats.\n\nWhile Twilight, Gylfie and Digger fend off the bats sent by Metal Beak, Soren navigates his way through a forest fire  and manages to disable the fleck trap. Upon returning, he sees Kludd, who attacks him. The brothers fight until Kludd falls into the fire below. Soren grabs a flaming branch and stabs Metal Beak to death, causing Nyra to retreat with the remaining Pure Ones. \n\nWhen they return to the tree, Soren and the others are initiated as new Guardians. Later, Soren tells the story to a group of owlets, revealing that Nyra is still out there and that Kludd's body was never retrieved. The film ends with the owls flying off into another storm.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{div col}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jim Sturgess]] as Soren, a [[barn owl]]et and the main [[protagonist]] who loves telling the stories about the Guardians.\n* [[Emily Barclay]] as Gylfie, an [[elf owl]]et who becomes Soren's best friend.\n* [[Ryan Kwanten]] as Kludd, a [[barn owl]]et and Soren's jealous and bitter older brother who becomes a soldier for the Pure Ones.\n* [[David Wenham]] as Digger, a [[burrowing owl]] who becomes friends with Soren and Gylfie.\n* [[Anthony LaPaglia]] as Twilight, a [[great grey owl]] and Digger's hollowmate who also becomes friends with Soren and Gylfie.\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as Nyra, a [[barn owl]] who is the [[queen regnant|queen]] of the Pure Ones.\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as Ezylryb/Lyze of Kiel, a [[whiskered screech owl]] and the legendary [[retired]] [[soldier]] leader of the Guardians of Ga'Hoole who's Soren's idol.\n* [[Joel Edgerton]] as Metal Beak, a [[greater sooty owl]], Ezylryb's archnemesis and Nyra's mate who is [[king]] of the Pure Ones.\n* [[Hugo Weaving]] as: \n** Noctus, a [[barn owl]], and Soren's father. \n** Grimble, a [[boreal owl]] who helps Soren and Gylfie escape St Aegolius and is killed by Nyra.\n* Adrienne DeFaria as Eglantine, a [[barn owl]]et and Kludd and Soren's younger sister who is moon blinked and given to Allomere for the Great Tree of Ga'Hoole.\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Mrs. Plithiver, a [[snake]] and the Alba family [[nursemaid]].\n* [[Sam Neill]] as Allomere, a [[great grey owl]] and a [[spy]] for Metal Beak.\n* [[Sacha Horler]] as Strix Struma, a [[short-eared owl]] and a Guardian.\n* [[Abbie Cornish]] as Otulissa, a [[short-eared owl]] and resident of the Great Tree of Ga'Hoole who Soren develops a crush on at first sight.\n* [[Richard Roxburgh]] as Boron, a [[snowy owl]] and the king of Ga'Hoole.\n* [[Essie Davis]] as Marella, a [[barn owl]] and Soren's mother.\n* [[Deborra-Lee Furness]] as Barran, a [[snowy owl]] and the queen of Ga'Hoole who is Boron's mate.\n* [[Barry Otto]] as The Echidna, an [[echidna]] who helps the Band get to Ga'Hoole.\n* [[Leigh Whannell]] and [[Angus Sampson]] as Jatt and Jutt, two [[long-eared owl]] cousins who work for the Pure Ones.\n* [[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]] as Bubo, a [[great horned owl]] and [[blacksmith]] of the Great Tree.\n* Gareth Young as Pete, a [[screech owl]]et who gets kidnapped by the Pure Ones and taken to St Aggie's but gets rescued by the end of the film.\n}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n[[Warner Bros.]] acquired the rights to produce a [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] film to the book series ''[[Guardians of Ga'Hoole]]'' by Kathyrn Lasky in June 2005.

A team of over 500 artists, technicians and support staff were amassed to design and animate 15 unique species of owls, as well as other forest creatures such as snakes, crows, bats, centipedes, bees, beetles, moths, a hermit crab, a [[Tasmanian devil]], and an [[echidna]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.animallogic.com/ |title=Animal Logic \u00bb Our Work \u00bb Film |work=[[Animal Logic]] |access-date=June 27, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe animated [[Closing credits|end credits]] sequence shows the adventures of Soren, Gylfie, Digger and Twilight as told by the young owls as if they were putting on a [[shadow play]] performance in the Great Tree. This idea was conceived by Felicity Coonan and took around three months to animate. Coonan wanted the sequence to be a playful experiment in 2D and 3D, as the classic storytelling form of [[shadow puppets]] is a 2D medium.

The rest of the cast was announced in November 2009, including [[Emily Barclay]], [[Abbie Cornish]], Jay Laga\u2019aia, [[Miriam Margolyes]], [[Helen Mirren]], and [[Sam Neill]] who replaced Jackman as the role of Allomere. However, like Jackman, both Taylor and Ravin were also no longer in the film. Laga\u2019aia was also going to voice Twilight but was replaced by [[Anthony LaPaglia]].\n\n== Release ==\n''Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole'' was theatrically released in the United States on September 24, 2010, and in Australia on September 30, 2010.
