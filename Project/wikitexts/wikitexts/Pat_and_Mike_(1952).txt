The movie was written by [[Ruth Gordon]] and [[Garson Kanin]], and directed by [[George Cukor]]. Cukor directed ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940) with Hepburn, and Cukor, Gordon and Kanin teamed with Hepburn and Tracy again for ''[[Adam's Rib]]'' (1949). Gordon and Kanin were nominated for the 1952 [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]]. for their work on ''Pat and Mike.'' (They had been similarly honored for ''Adam's Rib''.)\n\nHepburn was nominated in the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress]] category at the [[10th Golden Globe Awards]], while Ray was nominated for \"New Star of the Year\".<ref>[https://www.goldenglobes.com/person/aldo-ray Aldo Ray]</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nPat Pemberton ([[Katharine Hepburn]]) is a brilliant athlete who loses her confidence whenever her charming but overbearing fianc\u00e9 Collier ([[William Ching]]) is around. Women's golf and tennis championships are within her reach; however, she gets flustered by his presence at the contests. He wants her to give up her goal and marry him, but Pat does not give up on herself that easily. She enlists the help of Mike Conovan ([[Spencer Tracy]]), a slightly shady sports promoter. Together they face mobsters, a jealous boxer ([[Aldo Ray]]), and a growing mutual attraction.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Spencer Tracy]] as Mike Conovan\n* [[Katharine Hepburn]] as Pat Pemberton\n* [[Aldo Ray]] as Davie Hucko\n* [[William Ching]] as Collier Weld\n* [[Sammy White (actor)|Sammy White]] as Barney Grau\n* [[George Mathews (actor)|George Mathews]] as Spec Cauley\n* [[Loring Smith]] as Mr. Beminger\n* [[Phyllis Povah]] as Mrs. Beminger\n* [[Charles Bronson|Charles Buchinski]] as Hank Tasling\n* [[Frank Richards (actor)|Frank Richards]] as Sam Garsell\n* [[Jim Backus]] as Charles Barry \n* [[Chuck Connors]] as Police Captain\n* [[Joseph E.

She was an avid golfer and tennis player, and indeed performed all the sports footage in the film herself.\n\n===Filming===\n''Pat and Mike'' was filmed partly on location in [[California]]. The golfing scenes were filmed at the [[Riviera Country Club]] and [[Ojai, California|Ojai]] Valley Inn.  Tennis scenes were filmed at the [[Cow Palace]] in [[Daly City, California|Daly City]], near [[San Francisco]].  The opening scenes were filmed at [[Occidental College]], standing in as fictional Pacific Technical College.\n\n===Casting===\nMany notable athletes appear in [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] roles as themselves in the film, including golfers [[Babe Didrikson Zaharias]], [[Betty Hicks]], and [[Helen Dettweiler]], and tennis champions [[Don Budge]], [[Gussie Moran]] and [[Alice Marble]]. Other notables in the cast include [[Charles Bronson]] (credited as Charles Buchinski) in his second credited movie role, [[Carl \"Alfalfa\" Switzer]], [[Jim Backus]], and, in his acting debut, former athlete [[Chuck Connors]], later known as the star of ''[[The Rifleman]]'' television series.\n\n==Music==\nThe score for the film was composed and conducted by [[David Raksin]], with orchestrations by Robert Franklyn and Ruby Raksin.<ref name=Bradford>{{cite journal\n| title      = David Raksin at MGM (1950-1957)\n| others    = David Raksin\n| date      = 2009\n| url       = http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/notes/pat_and_mike.html\n| last      = Bettencourt\n| first     = Scott\n| type    = CD online notes\n| journal = [[Film Score Monthly]]\n| volume=12 |issue=2\n| location  = Los Angeles, California, U.S.A.\n}}</ref>  Of his music, Raksin said \"My music was sly and a mite jazzy, and despite the fact that everyone seemed to like it, so did I.\"<ref>{{cite journal\n| title      = David Raksin at MGM (1950-1957)\n| others    = David Raksin\n| date      = 2009\n| last      = Bradford\n| first     = Marilee\n| pages     =18\n| type    = CD liner notes\n| journal = [[Film Score Monthly]]\n| volume=12 |issue=2\n| location  = Los Angeles, California\n}}</ref>\n\nThe complete score was issued on CD in 2009, on [[Film Score Monthly]] records.\n\n==Reception==\nAccording to MGM records the film earned $2,050,000 in the US and Canada and $646,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $74,000.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/>\n\nIn his June 19, 1952 review in [[The New York Times]], [[Bosley Crowther]] praised the film as  \u201ca pleasing blue-plate of al fresco warm-weather fare\u2026 a shaky combination of, let us say, ''[[Woman of the Year]]'' and (if you can imagine without music) the theatrical ''[[Guys and Dolls]]''. But, withal, it is a likable fable about a highly coordinated dame who moves in upon and takes over a positive, authoritative guy, with slight overtones of honor triumphing over shadiness and greed. And it is smoothly directed by George Cukor and slyly, amusingly played by the whole cast, especially by its due of easy, adroit, experienced stars. Mr. Ray, as a dumb, moody fighter; Sammy White, as a shifty hanger-on, and William Ching, as the stuffed-shirt fianc\u00e9, are outstanding in support. George Mathews and Charles Buchinski are also fun as \"the kind of types that have been known to act very hot-headed in their day and age.\" (They are neatly manhandled by Miss Hepburn, using judo, in one scene.) And, as for the real professional athletes and the exhibitions they give, they are credible, colorful and exciting. That's enough in these hot summer days.\u201d<ref>{{Cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|date=1952-06-19|title=' Pat and Mike,' With Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn, New Film at Capitol|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1952/06/19/archives/pat-and-mike-with-spencer-tracy-katharine-hepburn-new-film-at.html|access-date=2021-07-12|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote: \u201cThe smooth-working team of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn spark the fun\u2026 Hepburn is quite believable as a femme athlete taken under the wing of promoter Tracy.

[[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] notes: \u201cHusband and wife screenwriters Kanin and Gordon wrote Pat and Mike specifically for their actor friends, tailoring the script to the streak of devilish humor lurking beneath Tracy's solid, consummately male persona and taking advantage of Hepburn's natural athletic abilities as a superior golfer and one of the best tennis players in Hollywood\u2026. The combination of Tracy's gruff, working-class demeanor and Hepburn's ladylike, patrician bearing provides ''Pat and Mike'' with some of its best comic moments, as when Mike, watching Pat walk across a golf course green, remarks to his partner in a thick Brooklyn accent \u201cThere's not much meat on 'er, but what there is, is cherce.\"  (The [[American Film Institute]] says it is a Bronx accent.)<ref>{{Cite web|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/50612|access-date=2021-07-12|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref> Such earthy humor endeared Pat and Mike to both critics and audiences and undoubtedly helped win...(the) nomination.... (The) witty script also took great advantage of the cozy, intimate rapport between Hepburn and Tracy who were an off-screen couple as well, and played upon the apparently mismatched but sizzling chemistry between the two lovers...As with ''Adam's Rib'', ''Pat and Mike'' is an honest, amusing account of the battle between the sexes, but also a celebration of male-female chemistry made all the more exciting when the romantic leads are also equals, a specialty of the Kanin-Gordon writing style. \u201d<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pat and Mike|url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/812/pat-and-mike#articles-reviews?articleId=457|url-status=live|access-date=2021-07-12|website=www.tcm.com|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Film}}\n* [[List of American films of 1952]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{AllRovi movie|37394}}\n* {{IMDb title|0045012}}\n* {{tcmdb title |812}}\n* {{AFI film|id=50612|title=Pat and Mike}}\n\n{{George Cukor}}\n{{Tracy Hepburn films}}\n{{Garson Kanin}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pat And Mike}}\n[[Category:1952 films]]\n[[Category:1952 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American sports comedy films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:1950s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by George Cukor]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Raksin]]\n[[Category:Films about women's sports]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Colorado]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Golf films]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]]\n[[Category:Occidental College]]\n[[Category:1950s American films]]"}]}}}}
