Justin notices that his grandfather's sword is missing and decides to find it as his first [[quest]]. His grandmother gives him a key which originally belonged to his grandfather and tells him to go to an [[abbey]], where three wise [[monk]]s will train him. After saying goodbye to his crush Lara, Justin embarks on his quest to become a knight. Along the way he meets Talia, a weary [[Bartender|barmaid]] who works at the Broken Eagle Inn, and a quirky [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] called Melquiades.\n\nJustin finds the abbey and trains with the monks, Braulio, Legantir and Blucher. During the training, the monks receive news that Sir Heraclio, the banished former knight who killed Justin's grandfather has returned from exile and is rounding up an army to seek retribution on the Queen for outlawing knights. After a near-fatal accident, the monks end the training. Blucher gives Justin his sword, telling him that he will need it.\n\nBack at home, Talia is disheartened when she learns that Justin has feelings for Lara. Justin finds out that Lara has fallen in love with Sir Clorex, who no one knows is really an armor polisher posing as a knight. Sir Clorex and Lara share a seemingly romantic moment together, until he kidnaps Lara and rides off with her. After some encouragement and persuasion, Reginald accepts his son's desire to become a knight and allows Justin to stand up against Heraclio. Justin, Talia and Melquiades go to Heraclio's hideout, where they find Lara being held captive by Sir Clorex and Heraclio. The three effect a daring rescue.\n\nThe Queen then gives Justin the title of Sir Justin and praises him for his bravery. She decides to re-establish the knights by signing a new contract. Justin tells Talia that he wants her to continue accompanying him on quests, as he has realized that she is the girl of his dreams. Talia happily accepts and kisses him, much to Lara's dismay. At the abbey, the monks create a statue of Justin in the newly expanded Hall of Knights.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Freddie Highmore 2013 (Straighten Crop).jpg\n| width1     = 100\n| image2    = Antonio Banderas 2014.jpg\n| width2     = 100\n| image3    = James Cosmo 2014 (cropped).jpg\n| width3     = 100\n| image4    = Charles Dance 2012 (cropped).jpg\n| width4     = 100\n| image5    = RupertEverett cropped-2.jpg\n| width5     = 100\n| footer      = [[Freddie Highmore]], [[Antonio Banderas]], [[James Cosmo]], [[Charles Dance]] and [[Rupert Everett]] starred in the movie.\n}}\n* [[Freddie Highmore]] as Justin, a teenage boy who dreams of becoming a knight like his grandfather before him.
