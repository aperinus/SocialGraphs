The film also stars Chaplin in his [[The Tramp|Little Tramp]] persona, [[Georgia Hale]], [[Mack Swain]], [[Tom Murray (actor)|Tom Murray]], [[Henry Bergman]], and [[Malcolm Waite]].\n\nChaplin drew inspiration from photographs of the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] as well as from the story of the [[Donner Party]] who, when snowbound in the [[Sierra Nevada]], were driven to [[cannibalism]] or eating leather from their shoes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charliechaplin.com/en/films/2-The-Gold-Rush/articles/5-Filming-The-Gold-Rush|title=Filming The Gold Rush|website=charliechaplin.com|access-date=January 20, 2018}}</ref> Chaplin, who believed tragedies and comics were not far from each other, decided to combine these stories of deprivation and horror in comedy. He decided that his famous rogue figure should become a gold-digger who joins a brave optimist determined to face all the pitfalls associated with the search for [[gold]], such as sickness, hunger, cold, loneliness, or the possibility that he may at any time be attacked by a grizzly. In the film, scenes like Chaplin cooking and dreaming of his shoe, or how his starving friend Big Jim sees him as a chicken could be seen.\n\n''The Gold Rush'' was critically acclaimed upon its release, and continues to be one of Chaplin's most celebrated works; Chaplin himself cited it several times as the film for which he most wanted to be remembered.<ref>{{cite book|title=1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die|language=sv| isbn= 978-9146213307| page= 60|last1=Schneider|first1=Steven Jay|year=2006}}</ref> In 1942, Chaplin re-released a version with sound effects, music, and narration, which received [[Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound Recording]]. In 1958, the film was voted number 2 on the prestigious [[Expo 58#International film poll|Brussels 12]] list at the 1958 World Expo, by a margin of only 5 votes behind [[Battleship Potemkin]]. In 1992, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nIn 1953, the original 1925 version of the film entered the [[List of films in the public domain in the United States|public domain in the United States]] because the claimants did not renew its [[copyright registration]] in the 28th year after publication.\n\n== Plot ==\n''The following is the plot of the 1942 re-release:''\n\nBig Jim, a [[Gold prospecting|gold prospector]] during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], in [[District of Alaska|Alaska]], has just found an enormous gold deposit on his parcel of land when a [[blizzard]] strikes. [[The Tramp|The Lone Prospector]] gets lost in the same blizzard while also prospecting for gold. He stumbles into the cabin of Black Larsen, a wanted criminal. Larsen tries to throw the Prospector out when Jim also stumbles inside. Larsen tries to scare both out using his shotgun but is overpowered by Jim, and the three agree to an uneasy truce allowing them all to stay in the cabin.\n\nWhen the storm is taking so long that food is running out, the three draw lots for who will have to go out into the blizzard to obtain something to eat. Larsen loses and leaves the cabin. While outside looking for food, he encounters Jim's gold deposit and decides to ambush him there when Jim returns.\n\nMeanwhile, the two remaining in the cabin get so desperate that they cook and eat one of the Prospector's shoes. Later, Jim gets delirious, imagines the Prospector as a giant chicken and attacks him. At that moment, a bear enters the cabin and is killed, supplying them with food.\n\n[[File:The Gold Rush (1925).webm|left|thumb|thumbtime=1|''The Gold Rush'' 1925<br>(full movie, public domain)]]\nAfter the storm subsides, both leave the cabin, the Prospector continuing on to the next gold boom town while Jim returns to his gold deposit. There, he is knocked out by Larsen with a shovel. While fleeing with some of the mined gold, Larsen is killed by an [[avalanche]]. Jim recovers consciousness and wanders into the snow, having lost his memory from the blow. When he returns to the town, his memory has been partly restored and he remembers that he had found a large gold deposit, that the deposit was close to a certain cabin, and that he had stayed in the cabin with the Prospector. But he knows neither the location of the deposit nor of the cabin, and so goes out looking for the Prospector, hoping that he can lead him to the cabin.\n\nThe Prospector arrives at the town and encounters Georgia, a dance hall girl. To irritate Jack, a ladies' man who is making aggressive advances toward her and is pestering her for a dance, she instead decides to dance with \"the most deplorable looking tramp in the dance hall\", the Prospector, who instantly falls in love with her. After encountering each other again, she accepts his invitation for a [[New Year's Eve]] dinner, but does not take it seriously and soon forgets about it. On New Year's Eve, while waiting for her to arrive to the dinner, the Prospector imagines entertaining her with a dance of [[bread roll]]s on forks. When she does not arrive until midnight, he walks alone through the streets, desperate. At that moment, she remembers his invitation and decides to visit him. Finding his home empty but seeing the meticulously prepared dinner and a present for her, she has a change of heart and prepares a note for him in which she asks to talk to him.\n\nWhen the Prospector is handed the note, he goes searching for Georgia. But at the same moment, Jim finds him and drags him away to go search for the cabin, giving the Prospector only enough time to shout to Georgia that he soon will return to her as a millionaire. Jim and the Prospector find the cabin and stay for the night. Overnight, another blizzard blows the cabin half over a cliff right next to Jim's gold deposit. The next morning the cabin is rocking dangerously over the cliff edge while the two try to escape. At last Jim manages to get out and pull the Prospector to safety right when the cabin falls off the cliff.\n\nOne year later both have become wealthy, but the Prospector never was able to find Georgia. They return to the [[contiguous United States]] on a ship on which, unknown to them, Georgia is also traveling. When the Prospector agrees to don his old clothes for a photograph, he falls down the stairs, encountering Georgia once more. After she mistakenly thinks he is a [[stowaway]] and tries to save him from the ship's crew, the misunderstanding is cleared up and both are happily reunited.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Charlie Chaplin|Charles Chaplin]] (as [[The Tramp]]) as The Lone Prospector\n* [[Mack Swain]] as Big Jim McKay\n* [[Tom Murray (actor)|Tom Murray]] as Black Larsen\n* [[Malcolm Waite]] as Jack Cameron\n* [[Georgia Hale]] as The Girl, Georgia\n* [[Henry Bergman]] as Hank Curtis\n* [[Tiny Sandford]] as Barman (uncredited)\n* [[Sam Allen (actor)|Sam Allen]] as Man in Dance Hall (uncredited)\n\n== Production ==\nChaplin attempted to film many of the scenes on location near [[Truckee, California]], in early 1924. He abandoned most of this footage, which included the Lone Prospector being chased through snow by Big Jim, instead of just around the hut as in the final film, retaining only the film's opening scene. The final film was shot on the back lot and stages at Chaplin's Hollywood studio, where elaborate Klondike sets were constructed.\n\n[[Lita Grey]], whom Chaplin married in November 1924, was originally cast as the leading lady but was replaced by [[Georgia Hale]] due to her pregnancy; she appeared in the film as an extra.\n\nDiscussing the making of the film in the documentary series ''Unknown Chaplin'', Hale revealed that the marriage had collapsed during production of the film; the final scene of the original version, in which the two kiss, reflected the state of his relationship with Hale by that time.\n\n== Box office ==\n''The Gold Rush'' was a huge success in the US and worldwide. It is the fifth-highest-grossing silent film in cinema history, earning more than $4,250,001 at the box office in 1926.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Chaplin proclaimed at the time of its release that this was the film for which he wanted to be remembered.<ref>Vance, Jeffrey.

Vance writes, \"The Gold Rush is arguably his greatest and most ambitious silent film; it was the longest and most expensive comedy produced up to that time.  The film contains many of Chaplin's most celebrated comedy sequences, including the boiling and eating of his shoe, the dance of the rolls, and the teetering cabin.  However, the greatness of ''The Gold Rush'' does not rest solely on its comedy sequences but on the fact that they are integrated so fully into a character-driven narrative. Chaplin had no reservations about the finished product.  Indeed, in the contemporary publicity for the film, he is quoted, 'This is the picture that I want to be remembered by.'\"<ref>Vance, Jeffrey (2003). ''Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema''.
