Distributed by [[Universal Pictures]] in the United States and [[Columbia Pictures]] internationally, the film stars [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] and [[Raul Julia]] (in his final film) along with supporting performances by [[Byron Mann]], [[Damian Chapa]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Ming-Na Wen]] and [[Wes Studi]]. Loosely following the plot of ''[[Street Fighter II: The World Warrior]]'', the film focuses on the efforts of [[Guile (Street Fighter)|Colonel Guile]] (Van Damme) to bring down General [[M. Bison]] (Juli\u00e1), the military dictator and drug kingpin of Shadaloo City who aspires to conquer the world with an army of genetic supersoldiers, while enlisting the aid of street fighters [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]] (Mann) and [[Ken Masters|Ken]] (Chapa) to infiltrate Bison's empire and help destroy it from within.\n\nThe film was commercially successful, with a worldwide box office gross approximately three times its production costs, and its [[home video]] releases and television broadcasts were also profitable, with the film earning Capcom a return of {{JPY|15.5 billion}} ({{US$|{{#expr:15500/94.06 round 0}} million|long=no}}) from the box office and home media. It was not well-received by critics for its campy tone, unfaithfulness to the source material and overblown effects. Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1's performance as M. Bison, was praised and garnered him a posthumous nomination for [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] at the [[Saturn Awards]], while the film was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film. The film was Julia's final theatrical performance, as he died of a stomach cancer two months before the film's release; the film is dedicated to his memory.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the Southeast Asian nation of [[Shadaloo]], civil war has erupted between the forces of drug lord-turned General [[M. Bison]] and the Allied Nations led by Colonel [[William F. Guile]]. Bison has captured several A.N. relief workers, and via a live two-way radio broadcast, demands Guile secure a US$20 billion ransom in three days. Guile refuses and vows to track Bison down and place him on trial for his crimes, but his assistant, Sergeant [[Cammy White]], is only partially able to pinpoint Bison's location to the river-delta region outside the city. One hostage is Guile's friend Sergeant [[Carlos \"Charlie\" Blanka]], who Bison orders taken to his lab for his captive doctor and scientist, [[Dhalsim]], to turn into the first of his supersoldiers. Though Charlie is severely disfigured by the procedure, Dhalsim secretly alters his cerebral programming to maintain Charlie's humanity.\n\nAmerican con artists [[Ryu Hoshi]] and [[Ken Masters]] attempt to swindle arms dealer [[Viktor Sagat]] by providing him with fake weaponry. Sagat sees through the ruse and has Ryu fight his cage champion, [[Vega (Street Fighter)|Vega]], but Guile bursts in and arrests everyone present for violating a curfew. In the prison grounds, Guile witnesses Ryu and Ken fighting Sagat's men, and recruits them to help him find Bison in exchange for their freedom, since Sagat is Bison's arms supplier. They are given a homing device and win Sagat's trust by staging a prison escape and faking Guile's death. However, news reporter [[Chun-Li]], whose father was killed by Bison, and her crew, former sumo wrestler [[Edmond Honda]] and boxer [[Balrog (Street Fighter)|Balrog]], who are out for revenge against Sagat for ruining their careers, stumble across the plan. Over Guile's objections, they attempt to assassinate the two warlords at a party. To maintain Bison's trust, Ryu and Ken stop the assassination and reveal the conspirators to Bison.\n\nReturning to his base, Bison inducts Ryu and Ken into his organization and orders Honda and Balrog imprisoned and Chun-Li taken to his quarters. Ryu and Ken break Balrog and Honda out of confinement and rush to confront Bison, who is fighting Chun-Li, but Bison escapes and releases sleeping gas, sedating them all. Guile plans his assault on Bison's base. He is impeded by the Deputy Secretary of the A.N., who informs Guile that the decision has been made to pay Bison the ransom, but Guile and his loyal troops nevertheless proceed with the mission. At the base, Dhalsim is found out by a security guard; during the ensuing fight, Charlie is released, and he kills the guard to protect Dhalsim. Guile arrives and sneaks into the lab, where he encounters Charlie. Guile prepares to shoot Charlie to end his suffering, but Dhalsim stops him. Bison prepares to kill the hostages by unleashing Charlie on them, but Guile emerges and engages Bison's guards until the remaining A.N. forces arrive. After Bison makes it clear that he will not surrender peacefully, Guile orders his allies to rescue the hostages and engages Bison in a personal duel. As Guile and Bison fight, Ryu and Ken defeat Sagat and Vega. Bison's computer expert [[Dee Jay]] flees through a secret passage, joined by Sagat. Bison's bodyguard, [[Zangief]], engages Honda in a fight until learning from Dee Jay that Bison was the true enemy, and sides with Ryu and Ken to save the hostages.\n\nGuile gains the upper hand against Bison and kicks him into a bank of hard drives, electrocuting him. A revival system restores Bison and he reveals that his suit includes advanced automatic first-aid mechanisms and electrical weaponry, including [[superconducting]] boots that enable him to fly. These gadgets allow Bison to gain the upper hand and beat Guile viciously. As he moves to deal the death blow, Guile counters by kicking Bison into his monitor wall which explodes, apparently killing him and overloading the base's superconducting energy storage system. The hostages are rescued, but Guile stays behind to convince Dhalsim and Charlie to return with him. They refuse, with Dhalsim wishing to atone for his responsibilities in mutating Charlie. Guile flees the exploding base and reunites with his comrades.\n\n<!-- [[WP:FILMPLOT]] Mid- and post-credit scenes should generally not be included in the plot summary.

This led to an environment where the cast would be trained only right before their scenes\u2014sometimes only hours ahead.<ref name=polygon/>\n\nDe Souza stated that he did not want to make a generic [[martial arts movie]] and described the film as cross between ''[[Star Wars]]'', [[James Bond in film|James Bond]] and a [[war film]]. In addition, he indicated that he also did not want to shoehorn in elements from the games, citing the previous year's poorly received [[Super Mario Bros.

De Souza said that he avoided the supernatural elements and powers from the games but would hint at their use for a sequel.<ref>{{cite news|title=Street Fighter 2 The Movie Secrets|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=60|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=July 1994|pages=40\u201341}}</ref>\n\n''Street Fighter'' was filmed mostly in [[Queensland, Australia]] along the famous [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] during the second and third quarters of 1994 with most of the interiors and exteriors filmed on soundstages in [[Brisbane]].

Upon its release on home video in the United Kingdom, the soundtrack was given away free with every purchase of the VHS tape at branches of [[Tesco]] for a limited period.

The music differs from Revell's more popular style,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} most notably with the absence of pervasive electronic elements, and is entirely orchestral as the score is performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]].  The campy style of the film is reflected in the score's parody cues. The music during the scene where Ryu faces Vega in the cage fight quotes Georges Bizet's Habanera from the opera [[Carmen (opera)|Carmen]], and a theme heard throughout the score, particularly in the track \"Colonel Guile Addresses the Troops\", is reminiscent of [[Bruce Broughton]]'s main theme for ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n==Release==\n''Street Fighter'' had opened in New York and Los Angeles on December 23, 1994.<ref name=\"afi\">{{cite web|url=http://afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=60247|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|title=Street Fighter|access-date=February 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film earned $3,124,775 on its opening day.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=daily&id=streetfighter.htm |title=Street Fighter |work= [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= October 24, 2013}}</ref> It grossed $9,508,030 on its opening weekend, ranking at #3 behind ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'' and ''[[The Santa Clause]]'' at the box office.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&yr=1994&wknd=51a&p=.htm |title= Weekend Box Office Results for December 23\u201326, 1994 | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= May 27, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Dumb and Streetfighter Doing Up the Holidays : Box office: Jim Carrey's film takes in an estimated $15.7 million, while Jean-Claude Van Damme's movie earns $11.8 million.|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 27, 1994|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-12-27-ca-13429-story.html|access-date=December 28, 2021|first=Richard|last=Natale}}</ref> On its second weekend it grossed $7,178,360 and dropped down to #7.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&yr=1994&wknd=52a&p=.htm |title= Weekend Box Office Results for December 30-January 2, 1995 | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] |date=January 2, 1995 |access-date=May 27, 2012}}</ref> The film grossed $33,423,521 at the domestic box office and $66,000,000 at the international box office, making a total of $99,423,521 worldwide.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on the [[VHS]] format in 1995, initially for [[video rental]] stores.
