The film follows a [[fat camp]] for kids that is taken over by a fitness [[guru]] named Tony Perkis ([[Ben Stiller]]).\n\n==Plot==\nWhen school ends for the summer, Gerry Garner\u2019s parents send him to Camp Hope, a [[weight loss]] camp for boys. Initially reluctant, Gerry meets enthusiastic camp counselor Pat, and befriends the other campers, who have smuggled in enough [[junk food]] for the entire summer. The first night at Camp Hope brings the revelation that the original owners, the Bushkins, have declared bankruptcy and the camp has been bought by [[physical fitness|fitness]] entrepreneur Tony Perkis Jr, who plans to transform the camp\u2019s weight loss program into a best-selling [[infomercial]].\n\nTony replaces the camp\u2019s beloved activities, including [[go-kart]]s and [[blobbing|\u201dthe Blob\u201d]], with a punishing exercise regimen. Pat is replaced by the strict new counselor Lars, and the campers endure a painful [[softball]] game against their more athletic, over-competitive rivals, Camp [[MVP]]. When Tony purges the [[Summer camp#Organization|cabins]]\u2019 hidden food caches, camper Josh stands up for Gerry by taunting Tony, and is sent home without a refund, which prompts the other campers to theorize about what happened to Josh after this. Tony arranges a dance with Camp Magnolia, a girls\u2019 summer camp, to humiliate the boys into losing weight, but counselors Tim, Pat, and camp nurse Julie convince everyone to enjoy themselves together. Josh returns to Camp Hope, revealing that his father, a lawyer, threatened to sue Tony for kicking his son out without a refund.\n\nGerry and his friends sneak into Tony\u2019s office in search of their confiscated snacks, and learn that Tony has intercepted all the campers\u2019 letters to their families, including the letter that Gerry wrote to his grandmother. They discover a secret food stash used by most of the camp, leading them to gain weight, and Tony forces the boys on a twenty-mile hike, preparing to endanger their lives for the sake of fitness. The boys trick Tony into falling into a pit, and imprison him at camp in a makeshift cell, electrified with a [[bug zapper]]. With Pat, Julie, and Tim on their side, the campers take back control of Camp Hope, tying up Lars in the woods with Tony\u2019s other counselors, and celebrating with a [[binge eating]] bonfire party. Tony's counselors, who are foreign, ultimately side with the campers due to threats of deportation.\n\nThe next morning, Pat rallies the campers to take responsibility for themselves and start losing weight, and they all start a healthier regimen while making Camp Hope fun again. The boys\u2019 parents arrive for visiting day and are shown a video documenting Tony\u2019s cruelty, which is interrupted by Tony, having escaped his cell. Exchanging blows with Gerry\u2019s father, he attempts a series of backflips but knocks himself out. As Tony is taken away, his own father (a [[Western Pennsylvania]] lamp store guru whose fortune Tony uses to buy and fund the camp) arrives and promises to refund everyone\u2019s money, but announces that the camp will be closed. The boys ask for the camp to stay open, and Pat \u2013 with eighteen years\u2019 experience and the support of Gerry and the others \u2013 agrees to assume responsibility for Camp Hope.\n\nUnder Pat\u2019s leadership, the campers restore their favorite activities, and prepare to face Camp MVP in their annual competition. Camp MVP takes the lead in the first event, an obstacle course, but Camp Hope catches up in the second round, a test of knowledge. In the final go-kart race, Gerry wins the competition for Camp Hope. Demonstrating that having fun is more important than winning, Pat throws the trophy in the lake, and seals his romance with Julie with a kiss. As Camp Hope celebrates their victory, Gerry thanks Pat for the best summer of his life.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Tony has become an unsuccessful door-to-door salesman selling [[Crystal healing|healing crystals]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aaron Schwartz (American actor)|Aaron Schwartz]] as Gerald \"Gerry\" Garner\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Tony Perkis Jr. / Tony Perkis Sr., Tony's father\n* [[Tom McGowan]] as Patrick \"Pat\" Finley\n* [[Tim Blake Nelson]] as Roger Johnson\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Maury Garner\n* [[Joseph Wayne Miller]] as Samuel \"Salami Sam\" Dampier\n* [[Jerry Stiller]] as Harvey Bushkin\n* [[Anne Meara]] as Alice Bushkin\n* [[Shaun Weiss]] as Josh Birnbaum\n* [[Kenan Thompson]] as Roy Murphy\n* [[David Bowe (actor)|David Bowe]] as Chris Donnelly\n* [[Leah Lail]] as Julie Belcher\n* [[Paul Feig]] as Tim Orford\n* [[Tom Hodges (actor)|Tom Hodges]] as Lars\n* [[Max Goldblatt]] as Phillip Grubenov\n* Robert Zalkind as Michael Simms\n* Patrick La Brecque as Dawson\n* Nancy Ringham as Mrs. Garner\n* [[Allen Covert]] as Kenny Parry, the cameraman\n* [[Cody Burger]] as Cody Farley\n* David Goldman as Nicholas Wales\n* [[Judd Apatow]] as Homer Schulz\n* [[Lauren Michelle Hill]] as Josie, the angelic girl\n* [[Peter Berg]] as the chef (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n''Heavyweights'' was filmed over the course of two months in North Carolina at 2 separate camps, Camp Pinnacle<ref name=people>{{cite web |last1=Garner |first1=Glenn |title=Judd Apatow Marks 27th Anniversary of His First Movie Heavyweights with '90s Throwbacks |url=https://people.com/movies/judd-apatow-marks-heavyweights-27th-anniversary/ |website=[[PEOPLE.com]] |access-date=24 July 2022 |date=February 20, 2022}}</ref> and Camp Ton-A-Wandah.<ref>{{cite web|title=Summer Camp!|url=https://roadtrippers.com/trips/15364854|website=Roadtrippers|access-date=July 2, 2017 }}</ref>\nFilming started on March 28, 1994 and finished on May 25, 1994.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe film's original score was composed by [[J.A.C.
