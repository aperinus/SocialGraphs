The story revolves around a boy who receives a [[cupboard]] as a gift on his ninth birthday. He later discovers that putting toy figures in the cupboard, after locking and unlocking it, brings the toys to life. The film stars [[Hal Scardino]] as Omri, [[Litefoot]] as Little Bear, [[Lindsay Crouse]], [[Richard Jenkins]], [[Rishi Bhat]] as Omri's friend Patrick, [[Steve Coogan]] as Tommy Atkins, and [[David Keith (actor)|David Keith]] as Boone the Cowboy.\n\n== Plot ==\nOn his ninth birthday, Omri receives an old cupboard from his brother and a toy [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] from his best friend Patrick. Omri gets a special key from his mom, which she got from her grandmother, and locks the toy in the cupboard. The next morning, he hears a small tapping noise coming from the cupboard, and finds that the toy has magically come to life. Frightened by Omri's size, the tiny man pulls out a dagger and points it at Omri. Omri closes and locks the cupboard and decides to keep it a secret.\n\nThe next day, the living toy eventually reveals himself as an English-speaking, 18th-century [[Iroquois]] (specifically [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]]<ref name=\"osteen\"/>) man named Little Bear ([[Litefoot]]) who was fighting in the [[French and Indian War]] on the side of the [[British Empire|British]]. During Little Bear's stay with Omri, Omri learns a lot about the Iroquois, and the two develop a friendship. Omri also learns that Little Bear is a widower.\n\nWhen Omri brings to life another Native American figure (resembling a [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] chieftain), saying Little Bear can have the chieftain's longbow, the chieftain suffers a heart attack out of fear after looking at Omri. Omri's shocked reaction causes Little Bear to realize that Omri really is a child, and not a spirit.\n\nEventually, Omri reveals his secret to Patrick, who immediately wants to bring to life a toy of his own, which becomes a cowboy from 1879 called \"Boohoo\" Boone. Boone and Little Bear are initially hostile toward one another, but are forced to behave themselves when Omri and Patrick bring them to school.\n\nThat night, Omri and Patrick, along with Little Bear and Boone, watch a program on TV that shows a relentless slaughter of [[Apache people|Apaches]] by cowboys. Boone is enthusiastic at the sight of his \"boys\" killing the helpless Native Americans, while Little Bear watches in horror at the sight of his people being massacred. Upon hearing Boone fire his gun into the air with delight, Little Bear becomes confused and shoots an arrow into Boone's chest.\n\nThe key to the cabinet is lost, and Little Bear goes under the floor to retrieve it, nearly getting killed by an escaped pet rat in the process. With the key back, Omri brings a World War I medic toy to life to treat Boone's wounds. Omri realizes it is time to return Little Bear and Boone to their respective time periods.  Later that night, as Patrick sleeps, Omri goes to bring a female Native American toy to life, but Little Bear realizes what Omri is doing and stops him. Omri says he doesn't want Little Bear to be alone when he goes back, but Little Bear says that the woman probably has people of her own, maybe even her own family. Omri agrees not to bring her to life.\n\nThe next morning, Omri and Patrick say their goodbyes to the two tiny men before locking them back in the cupboard and sending them home. Just before saying goodbye, Omri has a vision of a life-sized Little Bear telling him that he takes Omri on as his nephew.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Hal Scardino]] as Omri\n* [[Gary \"Litefoot\" Davis|Litefoot]] as Little Bear\n* [[David Keith (actor)|David Keith]] as Boohoo Boone\n* [[Lindsay Crouse]] as Jane\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Victor\n* [[Rishi Bhat]] as Patrick\n* Lucas Tejwani and Leon Tejwani as Baby Martin\n* [[Steve Coogan]] as Tommy Atkins\n* [[Sakina Jaffrey]] as Lucy\n* [[Vincent Kartheiser]] as Gillon\n* [[Nestor Serrano]] as Teacher\n* Ryan Olson as Adiel\n* [[Michael Papajohn]] as Cardassian\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Special Vocal Effects\n\n== Production ==\nLitefoot was discovered after performing a rap concert in Rome organized by the [[American Indian College Fund]], who recommended him to the producers.<ref name=\"davis\">{{cite news|date=1995-07-09|first=Sandi|last=Davis|title=American Indian Actor Uses Role to Educate Others|work=[[The Oklahoman]]|url=https://oklahoman.com/article/2507828/american-indian-actor-uses-role-to-educate-others|access-date=2020-10-10}}</ref> When he joined the film, Litefoot convinced the filmmakers to hire an Onondaga adviser, Jeanne Shenandoah,<ref>{{cite news|date=1995-07-09|first=Amy|last=Longsdorf|title=Native American Rapper Becomes Warrior Against Film Stereotypes|work=[[The Morning Call]]|url=https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1995-07-09-3055322-story.html|access-date=2020-10-10}}</ref> instead of the Mohawk adviser they had, and the adviser helped make his character Little Bear culturally authentic: \"From the bottom of my feet to the top of my bald head, all the tattooing, the dropped earlobes, the leggings, the moccasins, were all Onondaga in 1761.\"<ref name=\"osteen\">{{cite news|date=1995-07-02|first=Kathleen|last=O'Steen|title=Life Lessons, via Indians|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-07-02-ca-19356-story.html|access-date=2020-10-10}}</ref> Each day of shooting, it took 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours to apply his tattoos with permanent markers.<ref name=\"davis\"/>\n\nThe filming was marred by the death of technician Pat Tanner, who fell while riding a motorized hoist used to lift scenery on the sound stage at Sony Pictures in Culver City.<ref>{{cite news|title=Movie Technician Plunges to His Death on Stage|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-09-24-me-42304-story.html|access-date=2020-05-12}}</ref> Tanner's death led to a change in motion picture safety rules on IATSE union film sets to prevent similar accidents.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a score of 71% based on reviews from 24 critics, with an average rating of 6.4/10.
