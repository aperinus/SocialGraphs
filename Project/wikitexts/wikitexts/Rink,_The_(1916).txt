The film co-starred [[Edna Purviance]], [[Eric Campbell (actor)|Eric Campbell]], [[Henry Bergman]], and [[Albert Austin]], and is best known for showcasing Chaplin's [[roller skating]] skills.\n\n==Synopsis==\nCharlie plays an inept and sometimes clumsy waiter at a restaurant. One of his customers is the hot-tempered Mr. Stout. Charlie determines his bill by examining what he has spilled on his suit. While he is not a great server, Charlie is an excellent skater at the nearby roller rink. He meets a girl there and saves her from the unwanted attentions of the same Mr. Stout he earlier encountered at the restaurant. The grateful girl invites Charlie to a skating party. Charlie accepts and attends the party in top hat and tails. He again encounters the volatile Mr. Stout and runs afoul of Mrs. Stout. While skating, Charlie accidentally falls on her and pulls down her skirt. The skating party quickly descends into a riot. The police are called to restore order, but Charlie escapes by deftly rolling away with his cane hooked to the back of a moving automobile.\n\nChaplin's obvious skill on roller skates surprised many of his fans, but Charlie was an experienced performer. As a touring vaudevillian with Fred Karno's pantomime troupe, Chaplin appeared in a roller-skating skit in which he displayed talent for comedic falls\u2014and the ability to cause other skaters to topple.\n\n==Review==\nA reviewer from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' positively wrote, \"There is plenty of fun provided by [Chaplin] on the rollers and he displayed a surprising cleverness on them. A number of funny falls occurred as was looked for, with Charlie outshining and outwitting any of the others on the floor.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Charles Chaplin]] - A Waiter.
