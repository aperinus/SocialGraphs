It takes place on the [[Endor (Star Wars)|moon of Endor]], and features the [[Ewok]]s, who help two young human siblings as they try to locate their parents.\n\nThe film was given a limited international theatrical run, for which it was retitled '''''Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure'''''. It was followed by a sequel, ''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]'', in 1985.\n\n== Plot ==\nOn the forest [[Endor (Star Wars)|moon of Endor]], the Towani family starcruiser lies wrecked. The Towani family (Catarine, Jeremitt, Mace and Cindel) are stranded. When Catarine and Jeremitt vanish (having been captured by the [[List of Star Wars races (F-J)#Gorax|Gorax]]), the children are found by the [[Ewok]] Deej. After Mace tries to kill them, the Ewoks subdue him and take both children to the Ewoks\u2019 home. There, Cindel and [[Wicket W. Warrick|Wicket]] become friends. Shortly thereafter, the Ewoks kill a boar wolf only to find a life-monitor from one of the Towani parents with the creature.\n\nThey seek out the Ewok [[Logray]] who informs them that the parents have been taken by the monstrous Gorax, which resides in a deserted, dangerous area. A caravan of Ewoks is formed to help the children find their parents. They meet up with a boisterous Ewok woodsman named Chukha-Trok, Kaink the Ewok priestess, and a wistie named Izrina before finally reaching the lair of the Gorax after a few mishaps on the way. They engage the Gorax in battle, freeing Jeremitt and Catarine, but Chukha-Trok is killed. The Gorax is thought destroyed when it is knocked into a chasm, but it takes a final blow from Mace (using Chukha-Trok's axe) to kill the creature, which tries to climb back up after them. Thus reunited, the Towanis decide to stay with the Ewoks until they can repair the starcruiser, and Izrina leaves to go back to her family.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Warwick Davis]] as [[Wicket W.

During their time on the set, Lucasfilm decided that it might be an educational and rewarding experience for the older children, Eric Walker (Mace) and Warwick Davis (Wicket), to be given their own camera to use between takes. Calling themselves ''W&W Productions'', Walker and Warwick shot a documentary of the making of the film, which was released to Walker's YouTube channel in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last=Walker|first=Eric|title=Star Wars Ewok Adventures Making Of Teaser|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMLlKmrhfLM |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/KMLlKmrhfLM |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|via=YouTube|access-date=December 9, 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nWhen the film was released on DVD in 2004 it contained nothing but the film itself.

The release was a double-sided disc, with one film on each side. For this release, the film bore the theatrical release title, ''Caravan of Courage''.\n\nPrior to 2021, Disney announced no plans to add the Ewok films to its streaming service, [[Disney+]].
