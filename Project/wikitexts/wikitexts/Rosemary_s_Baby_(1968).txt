It is based on the 1967 [[Rosemary's Baby (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Ira Levin]].\n\nThough set in [[New York City]], the majority of principal photography of ''Rosemary's Baby'' took place in [[Los Angeles]] throughout late 1967. It was released in June 1968 by [[Paramount Pictures]], and was a [[box office]] success, grossing over $30 million in the United States. The film received numerous accolades, including multiple [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] nominations and two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations. Ruth Gordon won both the Academy Award for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] as well as the Golden Globe in the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture|same category]].\n\n''Rosemary's Baby'' deals with themes related to [[paranoia]], [[women's liberation]], [[Christianity]] ([[Catholicism]]), and the [[occult]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ward |first=Sarah |title=All of them witches: Individuality, conformity and the occult on screen |journal=Screen Education |issue=83 |year=2016 |pages=34\u201341 |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&sw=w&v=2.1&id=GALE%7CA467335921&it=r&asid=23711336d4c3b97545d608fe155564c9 |archive-date=June 25, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210605021459/https://galeapps.gale.com/apps/auth?userGroupName=&origURL=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.gale.com%2Fps%2Fi.do%3Fp%3DAONE%26sw%3Dw%26v%3D2.1%26id%3DGALE%257CA467335921%26it%3Dr%26asid%3D23711336d4c3b97545d608fe155564c9&prodId=AONE |url-status=live }}</ref> The film earned almost universal acclaim from film critics and won numerous nominations and awards. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest horror movies of all time. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]], being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\n==Plot==\nGuy Woodhouse, a [[stage actor]], and his wife, Rosemary, move into the Bramford, a large [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]] apartment building in [[New York City]]. They disregard their friend Hutch's warning about the Bramford's dark past with [[witchcraft]] and murder.\n\nIn the laundry room, Rosemary meets a young woman, Terry Gionoffrio, a recovering drug addict whom Minnie and Roman Castevet, the Woodhouses' elderly neighbors, have taken in. One night, Terry apparently jumps to her death from the Castevets' 7th-floor apartment, distressing the Castevets. While Guy grows close to the couple, Rosemary finds them annoying and meddlesome. Minnie gives Terry's pendant to Rosemary as a [[good luck charm]], saying it contains \"tannis root\".\n\nGuy is cast in a prominent play after the lead actor inexplicably goes blind. With his acting career flourishing, Guy wants to have a baby with Rosemary. On the night that they plan to conceive, Minnie brings over individual cups of [[chocolate mousse]] for their dessert. When Rosemary complains that it has a chalky \"under-taste\" and does not finish it, Guy criticizes her as being ungrateful. Rosemary consumes a bit more to mollify him, then discreetly discards the rest. Soon after, she grows dizzy and passes out. In a dreamlike state, Rosemary hallucinates being raped by a demonic presence ([[Satan]]) as Guy, the Castevets, and other Bramford tenants, all nude, watch. The next morning, Guy explains the scratches covering Rosemary's body by claiming that he did not want to miss \"[[Menstrual cycle|baby night]]\" and had sex with her while she was unconscious. He says he has since cut his nails.\n\nRosemary becomes pregnant, with the baby due the last week of June. The elated Castevets insist that Rosemary goes to their close friend, Dr. Abraham Sapirstein, a prominent obstetrician, rather than her own physician, Dr. Hill. During her [[first trimester]], Rosemary suffers severe abdominal pains and loses weight. By [[Christmas]]time, her gaunt appearance alarms her friends and also Hutch, who has been researching the Bramford's history. Before sharing his findings with Rosemary, he falls into a mysterious [[coma]]. Rosemary, unable to withstand the pain, insists on seeing Dr. Hill, while Guy argues against it, saying Dr. Sapirstein will be offended. As they argue, the pains suddenly stop and Rosemary feels the baby move.\n\nThree months later, Hutch's friend, Grace Cardiff, informs Rosemary that Hutch is dead. Before dying, he briefly regained consciousness and said to give Rosemary a book on witchcraft, ''All of Them Witches'', along with the cryptic message: \"The name is an [[anagram]]\". Rosemary eventually deduces that ''Roman Castevet'' is an anagram for ''Steven Marcato'', the son of a former Bramford resident and a reputed [[Satanism|Satanist]]. She suspects that the Castevets and Dr. Sapirstein belong to a Satanic [[coven]] and have sinister intentions for her baby. Guy discounts this and later throws the book away, upsetting Rosemary and making her suspicious of him.\n\nTerrified, she goes to Dr. Hill for help. Assuming that she is delusional, he calls Dr. Sapirstein, who arrives with Guy to take her home, threatening if she resists, to have her sent to a mental hospital. Rosemary locks herself into the apartment, but coven members somehow infiltrate and restrain her. Dr. Sapirstein sedates a hysterical Rosemary, who goes into labor and gives birth. When she awakens, she is told the baby was [[stillborn]]. As Rosemary recovers, she notices her pumped [[breast milk]] appears to be saved instead of disposed of. She stops taking her prescribed pills, becoming less groggy. When Rosemary hears an infant crying, Guy claims new tenants with a baby have moved into an apartment one floor up.\n\nBelieving her baby is alive, Rosemary discovers a hidden door in the bedroom closet leading directly into Minnie and Roman's apartment. Guy, the Castevets, Dr. Sapirstein, and other coven members are there, gathered around a [[bassinet]] draped in black with an [[upside down cross]] hanging over it. Peering inside, Rosemary is horrified and demands to know what is wrong with her baby's eyes. Roman proclaims that the child, Adrian, [[Antichrist|Satan's son]], \"has his father's eyes\". He urges Rosemary to mother her child, promising her she will not have to join the coven. When Guy attempts to calm her, saying they will be rewarded and will conceive their own children, she spits in his face. After hearing the infant's cries, however, Rosemary gives in to her maternal instincts and gently rocks the cradle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Mia Farrow]] as Rosemary Woodhouse\n* [[John Cassavetes]] as Guy Woodhouse\n* [[Ruth Gordon]] as Minnie Castevet\n* [[Sidney Blackmer]] as Steven Marcato / Roman Castevet\n* [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]] as Hutch\n* [[Ralph Bellamy]] as Dr. Abraham Sapirstein\n* [[Victoria Vetri|Angela Dorian]] as Terry Gionoffrio\n* [[Patsy Kelly]] as Laura-Louise McBirney\n* [[Elisha Cook Jr.|Elisha Cook]] as Mr. Nicklas\n* [[Emmaline Henry]] as Elise Dunstan\n* [[Charles Grodin]] as Dr. Hill\n* [[Hanna Landy]] as Grace Cardiff\n* [[Phil Leeds|Philip Leeds]] as Dr. Shand\n* [[D'Urville Martin]] as Diego\n* [[Hope Summers]] as Mrs. Gilmore\n* [[Marianne Gordon]] as Rosemary's girlfriend\n* [[Wende Wagner|Wendy Wagner]] as Rosemary's girlfriend\n* [[Tony Curtis]] as Donald Baumgart (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn ''Rosemary's Baby: A Retrospective'', a featurette on the DVD release of the film, screenwriter/director Roman Polanski, [[Paramount Pictures]] executive [[Robert Evans]], and [[production designer]] [[Richard Sylbert]] reminisce at length about the production. Evans recalled [[William Castle]] brought him the [[galley proof]]s of the book and asked him to purchase the film rights even before [[Random House]] published the book in April 1967. The studio head recognized the commercial potential of the project and agreed with the stipulation that Castle, who had a reputation for [[Low-budget film|low-budget]] [[horror film]]s, could produce but not direct the film adaptation. He makes a cameo appearance as the man at the phone booth waiting for Mia Farrow's character to finish her call.\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] claimed that [[Alfred Hitchcock]] was first offered the chance to direct the film but declined.<ref name=\"afi\" /> Evans admired Polanski's European films and hoped he could convince him to make his American debut with ''Rosemary's Baby''.{{sfn|Sandford|2009|pages=109\u2013110}} He knew the director was a ski buff who was anxious to make a film with the sport as its basis, so he sent him the script for ''[[Downhill Racer]]'' along with the galleys for ''Rosemary's Baby''.{{sfn|Sandford|2009|p=109}} Polanski read the latter book non-stop through the night and called Evans the following morning to tell him he thought ''Rosemary's Baby'' was the more interesting project, and would like the opportunity to write as well as direct it.{{sfn|Sandford|2009|p=110}} After negotiations, Paramount agreed to hire Polanski for the project, with a tentative budget of $1.9&nbsp;million, $150,000 of which would go to Polanski.{{sfn|Sandford|2009|p=110}}\n\nPolanski completed the 272-page screenplay for the film in approximately three weeks.{{sfn|Sandford|2009|p=110}} Polanski closely modeled it on the original novel and incorporated large sections of the novel's dialogue and details, with much of it being lifted directly from the source text.<ref name=avclub>{{cite web|url=https://aux.avclub.com/in-adapting-rosemary-s-baby-polanski-traded-ambiguity-1798253865|work=[[The A.V.

[[Mia Farrow]], with a supporting role in ''[[Guns at Batasi]]'' (1964) and the yet-unreleased ''[[A Dandy in Aspic]]'' (1968) as her only feature film credits, had an unproven box office track record; however, she had gained wider notice with her role as [[Allison MacKenzie]] in the popular television series ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]],'' and her unexpected marriage to noted singer [[Frank Sinatra]].{{sfn|Sandford|2009|pages=111\u2013115}} Despite her waif-like appearance, Polanski agreed to cast her.{{sfn|Sandford|2009|pages=111\u2013115}} Her acceptance incensed Sinatra, who had demanded she forgo her career when they wed.{{sfn|Sandford|2009|p=114}}\n\n[[Robert Redford]] was the first choice for the role of Guy Woodhouse, but he turned it down.{{sfn|Sandford|2009|p=112}} [[Jack Nicholson]] was considered briefly before Polanski suggested [[John Cassavetes]], whom he had met in London.{{sfn|Sandford|2009|p=112}} In casting the film's secondary actors, Polanski drew sketches of what he imagined the characters would look like, which were then used by Paramount casting directors to match with potential actors.{{sfn|Sandford|2009|p=113}} In the roles of Roman and Minnie Castevet, Polanski cast stage actors Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon.{{sfn|Sandford|2009|p=113}} Ralph Bellamy, also primarily a stage actor, was cast in the role of Dr. Abraham Sapirstein.{{sfn|Sandford|2009|p=113}}\n\nWhen Rosemary calls Donald Baumgart, the actor who goes blind and is replaced by Guy, the voice heard on the phone is actor [[Tony Curtis]]. Farrow, who had not been told who would be reading Baumgart's lines, recognized his voice but could not place it. The slight confusion she displays throughout the call was exactly what Polanski hoped to capture by not revealing Curtis' identity in advance.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Dakota Building (98553522).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|[[The Dakota (Manhattan)|The Dakota]] served as a stand-in for exterior shots of the fictional Bramford Building]]\n[[Principal photography]] for ''Rosemary's Baby'' began on August 21, 1967, in New York City, where location shooting commenced.<ref name=afi/> When Farrow was reluctant to film a scene that depicted a dazed and preoccupied Rosemary wandering into the middle of [[Fifth Avenue]] into oncoming traffic, Polanski pointed to her pregnancy padding and reassured her, \"no one's going to hit a pregnant woman\".
