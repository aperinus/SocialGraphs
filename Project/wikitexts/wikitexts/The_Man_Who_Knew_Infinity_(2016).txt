While performing his menial labor, his employers notice that he seems to have exceptional skills in mathematics and they begin to make use of him for rudimentary accounting tasks. It becomes equally clear to his employers, who are college-educated, that Ramanujan's mathematical insights exceed the simple accounting tasks they are assigning to him and soon they encourage him to make his personal writings in mathematics available to the general public and to start to contact professors of mathematics at universities by writing to them. One such letter is sent to [[G.H. Hardy]], a famous mathematician at [[University of Cambridge]], who begins to take a special interest in Ramanujan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/29/movies/the-man-who-knew-infinity-review.html|title=Review: 'The Man Who Knew Infinity' Gives a Mathematical Genius His Due|last=Webster|first=Andy|date=2016-04-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nHardy soon invites Ramanujan to Cambridge to test his mettle as a potential theoretical mathematician. Ramanujan is overwhelmed by the opportunity and decides to pursue Hardy's offer, even though this means he must leave his wife Janaki for an extended period. He parts lovingly with Janaki and promises to keep up his correspondence with her.\n\nUpon arrival at Cambridge, Ramanujan encounters various forms of racial prejudice and finds his adjustment to life in England more difficult than expected. Hardy, though much impressed by Ramanujan's abilities, remains concerned about Ramanujan's ability to communicate effectively due to his lack of experience in writing [[Mathematical proof|proofs]], but with perseverance, he manages to get Ramanujan published in a major journal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/the-man-who-knew-infinity/review/|title=The Man Who Knew Infinity is a by the numbers biopic \u2013 review|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-08-12}}</ref> In the meantime, Ramanujan is diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and his frequent letters home to his wife remain unanswered after many months. Hardy continues to see much more promise in Ramanujan. However, he remains unaware of the personal difficulties his student is having with his housing and with his lack of contact with his family back home in India. Ramanujan's health worsens while he continues delving into deeper and more profound research interests in mathematics under the guidance of Hardy and others at Cambridge.\n\nJanaki, after much elapsed time, wonders why she has not heard from Ramanujan and eventually discovers that his mother has been intercepting his letters, and withholding hers to him. Hardy makes special efforts to get Ramanujan's now recognizably exceptional mathematical skills accepted by the university, by nominating Ramanujan for a fellowship of Trinity College. At first, Hardy fails for reasons related to college politics and racial prejudice. By gaining the support of key members of the college, Hardy again successfully nominates Ramanujan as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]], thereby forcing his acceptance as a fellow of Trinity. Ramanujan is eventually reunited with his family in India, though his declining health, exacerbated by poor housing and harsh winter weather in England, ultimately takes its toll and leads to his death aged 32, soon after his recognition as a mathematician of international merit and importance.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Dev Patel]] as [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]]\n* [[Jeremy Irons]] as [[G.
