It is the [[sequel]] to the 2002 [[boxing film]] ''[[Undisputed (film)|Undisputed]]''. White portrays ex-boxer George \"Iceman\" Chambers, a role originally played by [[Ving Rhames]] in the first film. It was followed by two sequels: ''[[Undisputed III: Redemption]]'' (2010) and ''[[Boyka: Undisputed]]'' (2017), which continue the story of [[Russian people|Russian]] prison fighter Yuri Boyka, played by Adkins.\n\n==Plot==\nSome years after fighting Monroe \"Undisputed\" Hutchen in prison, former boxing champion George \"Iceman\" Chambers visits the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] for a series of boxing matches, where he is subsequently framed for [[Possession of drug paraphernalia|possession]] of [[cocaine]] and once again sent to prison. There, he discovers a series of [[Illegal sports|illegal]] [[mixed martial arts]] matches dominated by inmate Yuri Boyka. The prison officials arrange these fights and place large side-bets to make a personal profit, often at the expense of the fighters. Chambers shares a cell with Steven Parker, a British junkie.\n\n[[Russian mob|Mob boss]] Gaga and Warden Markov tell Chambers that if he fights Boyka, he will likely get an expedited appeal and early release. Chambers initially refuses, but after spending time in demeaning physical labor in the prison's sewer system and experiencing firsthand the brutality of the guards, he reluctantly agrees. He is rescued from both forms of humiliation by an inmate named Crot, who uses a wheelchair. Both fighters train hard for the match, though Chambers still relies on his boxing background while Boyka prepares a series of deadly kicks, throws, and grappling combinations designed to humiliate his opponent in the ring. Prior to the fight however, Boyka's gang force Steven, who is acting as Chambers' cornerman, to spike his water with a light sedative during the fight.\n\nDuring the fight, Chambers is somewhat taken by surprise at the flurry and variety of Boyka's attacks, but manages to hold his own through the first round by keeping his distance, staying calm, and dealing out painful punching combinations whenever possible. At the end of the first round, Chambers takes a few sips of the spiked water, causing him to lose on the second round when he loses consciousness and falls to Boyka's [[flying kick]]. Following the match, Steven hangs himself out of guilt. Later, Chambers confronts Boyka over the sedative incident; after Boyka learns that his gang spiked Chambers' water behind his back, Chambers demands a rematch to ensure his release. Chambers receives training in mixed martial arts from Crot, who was a [[Soviet Armed Forces|former soldier]] and the one who trained Boyka in his [[Sambo (martial art)|fighting style]].\n\nOnce the rematch begins, it is apparent to all the viewers that the combatants are evenly matched and Chambers is more impressive in his style. The fight is long and intense, with flurries of combinations, grapples, and throws traded between the two. Eventually, Chambers realizes that Boyka will not lose consciousness, will not submit, and will likely knock him out if the fight goes on too long. Chambers alters his strategy and manages to get Boyka in a [[joint lock]] and ends the fight by breaking Boyka's leg, proving that he is the undisputed new champion of the prison. Shortly thereafter, Chambers is released from prison and uses his winnings to buy Crot's freedom as well. In a final scene, he wheels Crot to a train station to meet with his estranged niece in a happy reunion. Crot thanks Chambers for giving him the remainder of the winnings to start his life again, while Chambers expresses his gratitude for the help and training. Crot then meets with his long lost niece and the two embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Michael Jai White]] as George \"The Iceman\" Chambers\n* [[Scott Adkins]] as Yuri Boyka\n* [[Eli Danker]] as Nikolai \"Crot\"\n* [[Ben Cross]] as Stevie Parker\n* [[Mark Ivanir]] as Gaga\n* [[Ken Lerner]] as Phil Gold\n* [[Daisy Lang]] as Svetlana \n* Silvio Simac as Arkady Davic\n* Ivaylo Geraskov as Alexi\n* [[Valentin Ganev]] as Warden Markov\n* Atanas Srebrev as Dmitri \n* Michail Elanov as Sergei\n* Velizar Binev as Kiril\n}}\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtracks===\n1. \"The Eyewitness of the World Had To See\" Performed by Male Choir of Valaam Conducted by Igor Ushakov Courtesy of 5 Alarm Music. <br />\n2. \"Mi Smo Za Lovu\" (We In The Money) Written by Dekembe Tutu Poku and Nathaniel Dawkins Translated, adapted and performed by Aleksandar Sasha Panich Published by Engine Co 35/Source in Sync Music (ASCAP) \ncourtesy of 5 Alarm Music.<br />\n3. \"Runnin'\" Written by Tom Erba and Nathaniel Dawkins Performed by Nathaniel Dawkins Published by Engine Co 30/Sync Source Music (BMI) Engine Co 35/Source in Sync Music (ASCAP) Courtesy of 5 Alarm Music.<br />\n4. \"Cocktail Lullaby\" Written and Performed by Stephen Edwards Published by Engine Co 35/Source in Sync Music (ASCAP) Courtesy of 5 Alarm Music.<br />\n5. \"Drug Dealer\" Written by Mike Mutantoff Performed by Mike Mutantoff and the Killektive Published by Killective records (ASCAP) Courtesy of NOMA Music.<br /> \n6. \"Krush You\" Written by Tom Erba Published by Engine Co 30/Sync Source Music (BMI) Courtesy of 5 Alarm Music. <br />\n7. \"Till I Die\" Written by Tom Erba and Nathaniel Dawkins Performed by Nathaniel Dawkins Published by Engine Co 30/Sync Source Music (BMI) Engine Co 35/Source in Sync Music (ASCAP) Courtesy of 5 Alarm Music. <br />\n8. \"Adrenaline Junkie\" Written by [[Dalibor Andonov]] (as Dalibor Andonov [[Gru (rapper)|Gru]]) Performed by Gru Published by SOKOJ (BMI) Courtesy of Centroscena.<br /> \n9. \"Bring It On\" Written by Tom Erba and Nathaniel Dawkins Performed by Nathaniel Dawkins Published by Engine Co 30/Sync Source Music (BMI) Engine Co 35/Source in Sync Music (ASCAP) Courtesy of 5 Alarm Music.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nMark Pollard of ''Kung Fu Cinema'' gave ''Undisputed II: Last Man Standing'' four out of five stars, calling it \"the first great martial arts movie of 2007 and Isaac Florentine\u2019s best to date.\"<ref name=\"KFCinema\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kungfucinema.com/reviews/undisputed-2-last-man-standing-2007 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140527180101/http://www.kungfucinema.com/reviews/undisputed-2-last-man-standing-2007 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-05-27 |title=Review: ''Undisputed II: Last Man Standing'' |author=Pollard, Mark |publisher=Kung Fu Cinema |access-date=2014-05-26 }}</ref>\n\n==Sequel==\n{{Main|Undisputed III: Redemption}}\nA sequel titled ''Undisputed III: Redemption'', was released in 2010.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0443676}}\n* {{AllRovi movie|339663}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|undisputed_2}}\n\n{{Undisputed}}\n{{Isaac Florentine |state=autocollapse}}\n{{Gru}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Undisputed Ii: Last Man Standing}}\n[[Category:2006 direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:2000s action films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American martial arts films]]\n[[Category:American prison films]]\n[[Category:2000s sports films]]\n[[Category:American boxing films]]\n[[Category:Direct-to-video sequel films]]\n[[Category:Films about suicide]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Isaac Florentine]]\n[[Category:Films set in Moscow]]\n[[Category:Films set in Russia]]\n[[Category:Films set in Saint Petersburg]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:Martial arts tournament films]]\n[[Category:Mixed martial arts films]]\n[[Category:Underground fighting films]]\n[[Category:2006 martial arts films]]\n[[Category:2006 films]]\n[[Category:Undisputed (film series)]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Boaz Davidson]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Boaz Davidson]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
