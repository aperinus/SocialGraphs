The film stars [[Heath Ledger]] as William Thatcher, a peasant squire who poses as a knight and competes in tournaments, winning accolades and acquiring friendships with such historical figures as [[Edward the Black Prince]] ([[James Purefoy]]) and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] ([[Paul Bettany]]). Its 14th-century story is intentionally anachronistic, with many modern pop culture references and a soundtrack featuring 1970s music.<ref name=\"screenrant.com\">{{cite web |title=20 Crazy Behind-The-Scenes Details About A Knight's Tale |website=screenrant.com |url= https://screenrant.com/details-knights-tale-behind-the-scenes/}}</ref> The film takes its name from Chaucer's \"[[The Knight's Tale]]\" in his ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', and also draws several plot points from Chaucer's work.\n\n''A Knight's Tale'' was released by [[Columbia Pictures]] in the United States on May 11, 2001. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $117.5&nbsp;million against a budget of $65&nbsp;million.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Plot summaries must be 400 to 700 words; see [[WP:FILMPLOT]] -->\nAt a [[jousting]] tournament in [[Middle Ages|14th&nbsp;century Europe]], squires William Thatcher, Roland, and Wat discover that their master, Sir&nbsp;Ector, has died. With one more pass, he could have won the tournament. Destitute, William wears Sir&nbsp;Ector's armour to impersonate him, taking the prize.\n\nAlthough only nobles are allowed in tournaments, William is inspired to compete and win more prizes. Roland and Wat would rather take their winnings and leave, but William convinces them to stay and help him train. While traveling, they encounter a young [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], who is also destitute and agrees to forge a [[patent of nobility]] so William can enter, [[assumed name|assuming the name]] of \"Sir&nbsp;[[Ulrich von Liechtenstein]]\" from [[Guelders|Gelderland]]. But William is brought before Simon the Summoner and Peter the Pardoner: Chaucer has a gambling problem and is in their debt. William demands Chaucer be released and promises payment.\n\nDuring the competition, William's armour is badly damaged; he goads Kate, a female blacksmith, into repairing it without payment. He wins the tournament's sword event, enabling him to pay Chaucer's debt. In the joust, he faces Sir&nbsp;Thomas Colville, who withdraws from the tournament after being injured by William, though they exchange a ceremonial pass so that Colville can retain the honour of never having failed to complete a match. The proceedings are observed by Jocelyn, a noblewoman with whom William has become infatuated, and Count Adhemar of [[County of Anjou|Anjou]], a rival both in the joust and for Jocelyn's heart. In the final joust, Adhemar defeats William. William vows revenge, but Adhemar taunts him, \"You have been weighed, you have been measured, and you have been found wanting.\"\n\nKate joins William's party and forges new lightweight armour. In the following tournament, Adhemar and William are both assigned to tilt against Sir&nbsp;Thomas Colville, but they learn that he is actually [[Edward the Black Prince|Prince Edward]], the future King of England. Unwilling to risk harming him, Adhemar withdraws; but William chooses to joust against Edward anyway and then addresses him by name, further earning his respect.\n\nAdhemar is called away to the [[Battle of Poitiers]], and William achieves several victories in his absence. William proves his love for Jocelyn by complying when she first asks him to deliberately lose (in contrast to knights who promise to win \"in her name\"), and then, just before he would be eliminated, to win the tournament after all.\n\nThe group travels to London for the World Championship. William recalls leaving his father to squire for Sir&nbsp;Ector and learn to become a knight, hoping to \"change his stars\". Adhemar has also arrived in London and announces that he is in negotiations with Jocelyn's father for her hand in marriage. William dominates at the tournament, but is seen visiting his now-blind father. Adhemar alerts the authorities to William's true identity.\n\nWilliam is arrested and placed in the [[pillory]], but is defended from the hostile crowd by his friends. Just as the mob reaches its frenzy, Prince Edward reveals himself. He acknowledges William's honour and an ability to inspire his friends' dedication that is in the best traditions of knighthood. Edward then announces that William is in fact descended from an ancient noble family, and knights him \"Sir&nbsp;William\". He asserts that as Prince-royal, his declaration is \"beyond contestation\".\n\nWilliam returns to the tournament to face Adhemar in the final match, but Adhemar cheats with an illegally sharpened lance, seriously injuring William. Entering the final pass, William is losing by two lances and must unhorse Adhemar to win. He demands to be stripped of his armour while Chaucer buys time by performing the introduction of William that he omitted earlier. William, unable to hold the lance due to his injuries, asks Wat to strap it to his arm. Finally, he tilts against Adhemar, with his father and Jocelyn in attendance. Bellowing his true name as he charges, he knocks Adhemar to the ground with a crushing blow; Adhemar experiences a vision of William and his friends mockingly telling him that ''he'' has been \"weighed, measured, and found wanting\". With this final blow, William wins the world championship. In the ensuing celebration, as Jocelyn and William embrace, Chaucer remarks that he should [[The Knight's Tale|write an account of these events]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Heath Ledger]] as William Thatcher, the protagonist who is a brave and loyal peasant who has dreamt of being a knight since childhood.\n** Leagh Conwell as Young William Thatcher\n* [[Shannyn Sossamon]] as Jocelyn, a lady of noble birth, bound to the church and encouraged to be faithful to God but enjoys the fun and tricks in life.\n* [[Rufus Sewell]] as Count Adhemar, the antagonist who is a wealthy, battle hardened knight. Thatcher offends Adhemar by intruding upon a conversation between Adhemar and Jocelyn, leading to their rivalry and antagonism. Adhemar believes Sir Ulrich (Thatcher) would be a \"lesser\" knight, \"not worth more than a peasant\", and starts taunting Thatcher in front of Jocelyn and the public.\n* [[Mark Addy]] as Roland, a squire to the late Sir Ector and a loyal friend of William.\n* [[Alan Tudyk]] as Wat, a violent, young squire who is obsessed with the greater things in life. He grows desperate but is a good friend of William. \n* [[Paul Bettany]] as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], who is portrayed as a big-headed writer and [[ring announcer]].

He has a terrible gambling habit, losing everything from his money to his clothes.\n* [[Laura Fraser]] as Kate, a hard-working widowed blacksmith who joins William to prove that her armor is as good, if not better, than her competitors.
