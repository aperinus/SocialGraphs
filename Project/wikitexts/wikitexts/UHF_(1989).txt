The film was directed by Jay Levey, Yankovic's manager, who also co-wrote the screenplay with him. The film was originally released by [[Orion Pictures]] and is currently owned by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Yankovic and Levey struggled to find a production company to finance the film, but were eventually able to get Orion's support after stating they could keep the film costs under $5&nbsp;million. Principal photography took place around [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].\n\nYankovic stars as George Newman, a shiftless dreamer who stumbles into managing a low-budget television station and, surprisingly, finds success with his eclectic programming choices, spearheaded by the antics of a janitor-turned-children's television host, Stanley Spadowski (Richards). He provokes the ire of a major network station that dislikes the competitive upstart. The title refers to the [[UHF television broadcasting|ultra high frequency]] (UHF) analog television broadcasting band on which such low-budget television stations were often placed in the United States. Yankovic and Levey wrote the film after Yankovic's [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic in 3-D|second studio album]], and chose the approach of George having a vivid imagination to support the inclusion of parodies within the film.\n\n''UHF'' was a financial disappointment, as it was overshadowed by several major Hollywood blockbusters that were released at the same time. The film also received mixed critical reviews, which left Yankovic in a slump that would last until the surprise success of [[Off the Deep End|his next album]] in 1992. Despite being considered a failure, ''UHF'' went on to become a [[cult film]] thanks to home video and cable TV. The [[VHS]] of the film was rare and [[out of print]] for many years, with copies going for high prices online. In 2002, the film was released on [[DVD]] for the first time, and [[Shout! Factory]] released a special 25th-anniversary edition of ''UHF'' on November 11, 2014, on DVD and [[Blu-ray]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nGeorge Newman, a dreamer who bounces between jobs, is put in charge of Channel 62, a [[Ultra-high frequency|UHF]] [[television station]], when his uncle Harvey wins ownership of it in a poker game. George and his friend Bob realize the station is nearly bankrupt, subsisting on reruns of old shows like ''[[Green Acres]]'' and ''[[Mister Ed]]''. When a package meant for their competitor, [[VHF]] station Channel 8, is misdelivered to George at Channel 62, he decides to deliver it himself, only to be rudely thrown out by RJ Fletcher, Channel 8's CEO. Outside, George meets Stanley, a janitor unfairly fired by RJ, and offers him a job at Channel 62.\n\nGeorge and Bob create new programs, including \"Uncle Nutzy's Clubhouse\", a live children's show hosted by George. The new shows fail to increase viewership with the station days from bankruptcy. While fretting over their finances, George forgets his girlfriend Teri's birthday dinner and Teri breaks up with him. George laments about his life during the \"Uncle Nutzy\" broadcast, then abandons the set, tells Stanley he can host the show, and goes to a bar with Bob. At the bar they find the patrons eagerly watching Stanley's slapstick antics on Channel 62. Inspired by Stanley's popularity, George and Bob create a range of bizarre shows to fill the schedule, headlined by the re-titled \"Stanley Spadowski's Clubhouse\".\n\nRJ, infuriated that Channel 62's ratings now rival those of Channel 8, discovers Harvey owns the station and owes his bookie $75,000 by the end of the week. RJ offers to pay off Harvey's debt in exchange for the deed to Channel 62. George launches a [[telethon]] to sell stock in the station, which would not only save it from RJ but also make it publicly owned. RJ's henchmen stall the telethon by kidnapping Stanley, whom George and several staff members rescue. RJ again attempts to stall the telethon with a televised public statement, but Channel 62 engineer Philo [[broadcast signal intrusion|hijacks]] it with secretly-recorded footage of RJ (during a confrontation with Teri in which she defends George and Channel 62) insulting the town's population.\n\nThe telethon ends $2,000 short of its goal. Harvey concedes victory to RJ who, instead of immediately taking ownership, gloats to the crowd. Meanwhile, a homeless man approaches George, asking to buy the rest of the stock with money obtained by selling a [[1955 doubled die cent|rare coin]] that RJ had given him, unaware of its true value. George pays off Big Louie, Harvey signs the ownership transfer, and the station officially becomes publicly owned. RJ learns that due to Channel 8 filing late for renewal of their broadcast license and the tirade Philo had broadcast, the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] is revoking their license. George and the Channel 62 staff and their audience celebrate and George and Teri rekindle their romantic relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] as George Newman, a daydreaming slacker who becomes the program director of Channel 62 at the behest of his aunt Esther. \n* [[David Bowe (actor)|David Bowe]] as Bob Steckler/Bobbo the Clown, George's best friend and roommate.\n* [[Fran Drescher]] as Pamela Finklestein, a secretary at Channel 62 who longs to be an on-air reporter.  \n* [[Michael Richards]] as Stanley Spadowski, the [[janitor]] at Channel 62 who also serves as the host of its highest-rated show.  \n* [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]] as R.J.

Club]] }}</ref> The story concept they created was based on Yankovic's approach to his music videos, making parodies of other works. After sketching out a number of such parodies for a film, the concept of Yankovic being the owner of a small-time UHF station broadcasting these parodies as shows was born, as this would not require having any significant plot to string the parodies together, in a manner similar to ''[[Airplane!]]'' (1980).<ref name=\"avclub\"/>\n\nThe two attempted to shop the script around Hollywood film agencies for about three years without luck. They were surprised when one of their agents had shown the script to the founders of a new production company, Cinecorp, who were interested in the script and had given it to producers Gene Kirkwood and [[John W. Hyde]]; Kirkwood stated he had previously seen Yankovic's videos and wanted to make a movie with him.<ref name=\"avclub\"/> Kirkwood and Hyde had connections with [[Orion Pictures]], who offered to fund the production as long as they could keep it under $5&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"avclub\"/>\n\nThe title of the film was selected to refer to, at the time of the film's writing, the predominance of local television stations operating on [[UHF television broadcasting|ultra-high-frequency broadcasts]] in the United States, which were typically known for quirky, low-cost production shows, which the film spoofed.<ref name=\"avclub\"/> Yankovic suggested the title '''''The Vidiot''''' for the film's international release, but the studio eventually went with '''''The Vidiot from UHF''''' in an effort to connect the international and American versions, with which Yankovic has expressed dissatisfaction.<ref name=\"avclub\"/><ref>DVD audio commentary, menus, etc.</ref>\n\n===Locations===\nPrimary filming for ''UHF'' occurred in [[Tulsa]]; the film's executive producer [[Gray Frederickson]] had earlier finished shooting of ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]'' in Oklahoma, and found the ease and the cost to film in the state to suit the needs of ''UHF''.<ref name=\"avclub\"/> They found several favorable factors that made the city suitable for filming. At the time of filming, the Kensington Galleria (71st and Lewis) was being closed down to convert the mall into office space, allowing the production team to use it for both sound stage and interior scenes including those for both Channels 8 and 62; the mall was also situated near a hotel making it ideal for housing the cast and crew during filming.<ref name=\"avclub\"/> The area and close proximity to Dallas allowed them to recruit additional local talent for some of the acts during the telethon scenes.<ref name=\"avclub\"/>\n\nThe Burger World location was Harden's Hamburgers at 6835 East 15th Street in Tulsa, and \"Bowling for Burgers\" was filmed at Rose Bowl Lanes on East 11th Street. The bar location was Joey's House of the Blues at 2222 East 61st Street. The building used for Kuni's Karate School belongs to Welltown Brewery and is located at 114 West Archer in Tulsa, while \"Crazy Ernie's Used Car Emporium\" was filmed on the lot of [[Pontiac (automobile)|Ernie Miller Pontiac]] at 4700 South Memorial.<ref>[http://www.robohara.com/uhf UHF - My 15 Year Pilgrimage], [[Rob O'Hara]]</ref> The dead fish in the [[game show]] \"Wheel of Fish\" were real, obtained from the White River Fish Market. The news desk was located at [[Oklahoma Educational Television Authority|OETA]], a local [[PBS]] member station. The steps of City Hall are actually First Christian Church at 913 S. Boulder, built in 1920. Channel 8's exterior is an office block (6655 South Lewis Building) occupied by [[Hewlett-Packard]]. The \"U-62\" building was constructed around [[KGTO]] 1050's [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]] [[transmitter]] site (5400 West Edison Street); the real KGTO studios had been moved elsewhere in 1975. Just the tower itself remains at this location today.<ref>[http://tulsatvmemories.com/kfmj.html A little history of KFMJ 1050 AM], Wayne McCombs, Tulsa TV Memories</ref> The airport scenes were taken at [[Tulsa International Airport]].\n\n===Casting===\nYankovic was always envisioned to be the central character of the film George Newman, written as a [[straight man]] with a vivid imagination as to allow the insertion of the parodies into the film's script in a manner similar to the film ''[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947 film)|The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]'' (1947).<ref name=\"avclub\"/> As the focus of the film was to be on the parodies, George was not fleshed out beyond enough character development to drive the principal storyline.<ref name=\"avclub\"/> The name \"Newman\" was selected as homage to ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine's mascot, [[Alfred E. Neuman]], further referenced by the name of \"Uncle Nutsy's Clubhouse\".<ref name=\"avclub\"/>\n\nThe role of Stanley Spadowski was written by Yankovic with Michael Richards in mind; at the time, Yankovic had been impressed with Richards' stand-up comedy and performance on the show ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]''.<ref name=\"avclub\"/> Yankovic had also considered that Stanley's role was influenced by [[Christopher Lloyd]]'s performance on ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'', and had considered reaching out to Lloyd to offer him the role, but decided to stay with Richards due to their original premise.<ref name=\"avclub\"/> Richards' agents had told Yankovic that he was not interested in the role as Richards at the time was suffering a bout of [[Bell's palsy]], but when they reached out to Richards again, Richards came to the set, dropping right into the character of Stanley for the test read.<ref name=\"avclub\"/>\n\nOther principal roles were cast through normal auditions, with most of the choices based on how well the actor fit the role. For George's girlfriend Teri Campbell, they did not feel that they needed to spend a significant amount of time developing this side as they did not consider Yankovic to be the type of actor for a romantic lead. Although [[Jennifer Tilly]] and [[Ellen DeGeneres]] auditioned, they found Victoria Jackson's soft demeanor to be well-suited for the role.<ref name=\"avclub\"/>\n\nFor R.J. Fletcher, they found that Kevin McCarthy was in a similar stage of his career as [[Leslie Nielsen]], one of many \"serious vintage actors who had crossed over into satire\", according to Levey, and McCarthy relished the role.<ref name=\"avclub\"/> In the DVD commentary, Yankovic noted that McCarthy struggled not to laugh during takes. McCarthy himself later described his own character as a fellow who \"makes [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] look like [[Sally Struthers]]\". Yankovic also cited one of McCarthy's best-known roles as the ageless history teacher in the classic ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' episode \"[[Long Live Walter Jameson]]\". Noting McCarthy's gray hair, Yankovic recalled a scene at the end, when Jameson aged rapidly, saying, \"For just a split second, he looked just like [he did in the movie].\"\n\n[[Fran Drescher]] was selected for the role of Pamela Finklestein, both for her established comedy and for her nasally voice that made a humorous contrast for a news anchor.<ref name=\"avclub\"/>\n\nThe producers considered [[Jerry Seinfeld]] for the role of George's friend Bob Speck, but he turned it down. David Bowe, who had been a long-time Yankovic fan, easily fit the role during auditions.<ref name=\"avclub\"/>\n\nPhilo's role was written with [[Joel Hodgson]] in mind, building on Hodgson's stand-up routines of using homemade inventions and deadpan comedy. Hodgson turned down the role, feeling at the time that he was not a good actor.<ref name=\"avclub\"/> At the time, Hodgson was also working on ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. They also approached [[Crispin Glover]] for Philo's role, but Glover said that he only wanted to play a used car salesman and no other part, turning down the offer.<ref name=\"avclub\"/> As they sought other actors, their casting agent Cathy Henderson offered up Anthony Geary, who at the time had gained popularity due to his role on ''[[General Hospital]]''. Geary wanted to perform the role both as a fan of Yankovic and seeing the role as completely opposite from his normal acting.<ref name=\"avclub\"/>\n\nKuni was written from the start with the intention of being performed by Gedde Watanabe.<ref name=\"avclub\"/>\n\nEmo Philips was a close friend of Yankovic, and Yankovic felt that he had to include Philips in the movie, eventually creating the role of the clumsy shop teacher for him.<ref name=\"avclub\"/>\n\n[[Ginger Baker]] of the rock band [[Cream (band)|Cream]] volunteered to audition for the role of the hobo, but Yankovic and the production team found Vance Colvig Jr. to be a better fit.<ref name=\"avclub\"/>\n\nLevey himself appears in the movie playing [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in the spoof segment ''Gandhi II''.<ref name=\"avclub\"/>\n\nAfter Trinidad Silva performed his primary scenes, his character was to return for the telethon scenes which had not yet been filmed; however, he died in a car accident.  The filmmakers were too grief-stricken to use body doubles and dropped Silva's appearances in the telethon. The film was dedicated to Silva.<ref name=\"avclub\"/>\n\n[[Sylvester Stallone]] had initially agreed to make a cameo appearance in the film's final act, in the dream sequence in which Yankovic's Newman imagines himself as a [[John Rambo]]-type soldier on a mission to rescue Stanley Spadowski ([[Michael Richards]]), but ultimately declined to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/uhf-movie-sylvester-stallone-rambo-cameo-rejection/|publisher=[[Screen Rant]]|author=Cotter, Padraig|title=Why Stallone Backed Out Of A Cameo In UHF's Rambo Parody Sequence|language=en-US|url-status=live|date=February 19, 2022|accessdate=March 26, 2022|archivedate=February 19, 2022|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20220219194622/https://screenrant.com/uhf-movie-sylvester-stallone-rambo-cameo-rejection/}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''UHF'' received mixed reviews.

Orion Pictures released ''UHF'' on July 21, 1989, hoping it would be a [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|summer blockbuster]] that would revive their commercial fortunes. However, critical response was negative,<ref name=\"av club retro\"/> and it was out of the theaters by the end of the month.{{citation needed|date = April 2011}} The film has been compared to ''[[Young Einstein]]'', which similarly scored well with test audiences but failed to make a critical impression.<ref name=\"av club retro\"/> Yankovic has stated that it was not a \"critic movie\". As Yankovic states in his commentary of the movie, ''UHF'' was thought to be the movie that would \"save the studio\" for Orion. He was treated very well because of this. He states in the commentary: \"Every morning I would wake up to fresh strawberries next to my bed. Then, when the movie bombed, I woke up and...no more strawberries!\"\n\nWithin the month prior, and up to the release of ''UHF'', studios released bigger movies like ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]'', ''[[Lethal Weapon 2]]'', ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', ''[[Licence to Kill]]'', ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'', ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'' and ''[[Weekend at Bernie's]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/index1989.php |title=The Numbers }}</ref> The draw of these blockbuster movies also contributed to the low attendance at ''UHF''{{'s}} premiere; ''[[The A.V.

In the several years ''UHF'' was out of print, the film developed a [[cult following]], and fans of the film and Yankovic in general pawed desperately for a copy. Prices skyrocketed, ranging from fifty to a hundred dollars or more. Finally, ''UHF'' was released on [[DVD]] in 2002 by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and, in its debut week, it became a top ten bestseller in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine.
