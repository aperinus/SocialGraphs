The film explores what Moore suggests are the primary causes for the [[Columbine High School massacre]] in 1999 and other acts of [[gun violence]]. He focuses on the background and environment in which the massacre took place and some common public opinions and assumptions about related issues. The film also looks into the nature of violence in the United States, and American violence abroad.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzzImeQS2x0 Looking Back at BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE - criterioncollection on YouTube]</ref>\n\nA critical and commercial success, the film brought Moore international attention as a rising filmmaker and won numerous awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]], the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary Feature]], a special ''55th Anniversary Prize'' at the [[2002 Cannes Film Festival]],<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3137379/year/2002.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Bowling for Columbine |access-date=2009-10-24 |work=festival-cannes.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710235222/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3137379/year/2002.html |archive-date=2011-07-10 }}</ref> and the [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Foreign Film]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310793/awards|title=Bowling for Columbine|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> The film is widely considered one of the [[list of films considered the best#Documentary|greatest documentary films of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.cwu.edu/media/intnationaldoc20.htm |title=International Documentary Association Top Twenty Documentaries of All-Time|access-date=2009-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213002531/http://www.lib.cwu.edu/media/intnationaldoc20.htm |archive-date=2008-02-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/library/weekly/aabowlingawardnews.htm|title=\"Bowling for Columbine\" Named Best Documentary Film|date=2002-12-12 |publisher=About.com|access-date=2009-09-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Top 100 Documentary Movies |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/top_100_documentary_movies/ |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=February 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306161130/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/top_100_documentary_movies/ |archive-date=March 6, 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The 25 \"Greatest\" Documentaries of All Time: 5.

Later investigations showed that this was based on mistaken recollections, and Glenn Moore of the Golden Police Department concluded that they were absent from school on the day the attack took place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.salon.com/0001137/2005/04/16.html#a1561 |title=A little unfinished business on Bowling and Columbine |first=Dave |last=Cullen |date=2005-04-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715233749/http://blogs.salon.com/0001137/2005/04/16.html |archive-date=2011-07-15}} recorded by the ''Boulder Daily Camera''</ref>\n\nMoore incorporates the concept of recreational bowling into the film in other ways as well. For example, the [[Michigan Militia]] use bowling pins for their target practice. When interviewing former classmates of the two boys, Moore notes that the students took a bowling class in place of [[Physical education class|physical education]]. He suggests that this might have very little educational value and the people he interviews generally agree, noting how Harris and Klebold led introverted lifestyles and had careless attitudes towards the game, and that nobody thought twice about it. Moore questions whether the school system is responding to the real needs of students or if they are reinforcing fear. Moore also interviews two young residents of [[Oscoda, Michigan|Oscoda]], [[Michigan]]. Moore suggests a [[culture of fear]] created by the government and the media leads Americans to arm themselves, to the advantage of gun-making companies. Moore suggests that bowling could have been just as responsible for the attacks on the school as Marilyn Manson, or even [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]], who launched [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|bombing attacks]] on [[Serbia]] at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/hey_wait_a_minute/2004/01/wesley_me.html|title=Wesley & Me|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|first=Michael|last=Hastings|date=2004-01-21}}</ref>\n\n===Free gun for opening a bank account===\n[[Image:Bowling4columbine.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Michael Moore upon receiving his free rifle at the bank.<ref name=\"cst\">Nol, Michael.

They say that the bank's policy was to conduct background checks on rifle recipients and mail the rifles to a licensed gun dealer, but Moore's agents, under the pretext of \"doing a story on unique businesses across America\", convinced bank employees to have his rifle presented to him on camera the morning after filming his account opening. Further, they counter that contrary to the film's supposition that the bank kept hundreds of guns on their premises, the gun which was handed to Michael Moore in the film was shipped overnight from a vault in a branch {{convert|300|mi}} away. Moore denied that this sequence was staged but acknowledged the timing of events was compressed for production reasons. He reminded his viewers that North Country Bank is a licensed firearms dealer and, in addition to its [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] license number, he produced out-takes where bank employee Jan Jacobson confirms on camera that rifles are secured locally on bank premises.<ref>{{cite web | title=Michael Moore responds to the wacko attacks ... | url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/books-films/facts/bowling-columbine/ | author=Michael Moore | date=September 2003 | access-date=2008-05-30 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002185200/http://michaelmoore.com/books-films/facts/bowling-columbine | archive-date=2009-10-02 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=\"Bowling for Columbine\" outtakes |url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/wackoattacko/movie.php?mov=bank-full |author=Michael Moore |date=September 2003 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313141106/http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/wackoattacko/movie.php?mov=bank-full |archive-date=2012-03-13 |access-date=2016-09-03 }}</ref>\n\n===\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\" montage===\nAbout 20 minutes into the film, the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song \"[[Happiness Is a Warm Gun]]\" plays during a [[Montage sequence|montage]] in which footage of the following is shown:\n\n* People buying guns\n* Residents of [[Virgin, Utah]], a town that passed a law requiring all residents to own guns\n* People firing rifles at [[carnival]]s and [[shooting range]]s\n* Denise Ames operating a [[rifle]]\n* [[Carey McWilliams (marksman)|Carey McWilliams]], a blind gun enthusiast from [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]], [[North Dakota]]\n* [[Gary Plauch\u00e9]] killing Jeff Doucet, who had kidnapped and [[sexual abuse|molested]] Plauch\u00e9's son\n* The suicide of [[R.

It is implied that the presence of this facility within the community, and the acceptance of [[structural violence|institutionalized violence]] as a solution to conflict, contributed to the mindset that led to the massacre.\n\nMoore conducts an interview with Evan McCollum, Director of Communications at a [[Lockheed Martin]] plant near Columbine, and asks him:\n\n{{blockquote|So you don't think our kids say to themselves, 'Dad goes off to the factory every day, he builds missiles of [[weapon of mass destruction|mass destruction]].'

On the website accompanying the film, Moore provides additional background information for this section.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/books-films/bowlingforcolumbine/library/wonderful/index.php|title=Bowling for Columbine : Library : What a Wonderful World|publisher=MichaelMoore.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628131147/http://www.michaelmoore.com/books-films/bowlingforcolumbine/library/wonderful/index.php|archive-date=2009-06-28}}</ref>\n\n===Climate of fear===\nMoore contrasts his portrayal of the U.S. attitude toward guns and violence with the attitude prevailing in areas of Canada where gun ownership is at similar levels to the U.S. He illustrates his thesis by visiting neighborhoods in Canada near the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013U.S. border]], where he finds front doors unlocked and much less concern over crime and [[security]]. In regards to the film, Farber states \"Moore's thesis, which he later elaborated in ''Fahrenheit 9/11'', is that the fear-mongering that permeates American society contributes to our epidemic of gun violence\". Moore shows news stories in Canada which do not follow the \"if it bleeds it leads\" mentality. This adds to Moore's argument that the media is driving America's fear as well as their need for protection. The cartoon \"A Brief History of the United States of America\" encompasses Moore's view of where the fear in America started and how it's progressed and changed over the years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.documentary.org/magazine/michael-moores-bowling-columbine-2002|title=Michael Moore's 'Bowling for Columbine' (2002)|last=Farber|first=Stephen|website=IDA|date=30 November 2007 |access-date=2016-05-01}}</ref>\n\nIn this section, there is a montage of several social pundits stating possible causes for gun violence. Many claim links with violence in television, cinema, and [[personal computer game|computer games]]; towards the end of the montage, however, the same people all change their claims to [[Marilyn Manson]]'s responsibility. Following this is an interview between Moore and Marilyn Manson. Manson shares his views about the United States' climate with Moore, stating that he believes U.S. society is based on \"fear and consumption\", citing [[Colgate-Palmolive|Colgate]] commercials that promise \"if you have bad breath, [people] are not going to talk to you\" and other commercials containing fear-based messages. Manson also mentions that the media, under heavy government influence, had asserted that his influence on the acts of Klebold and Harris was far greater than that of President Clinton, who ordered more bombings on [[Kosovo]] on April 20, 1999, than any other day during the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO campaign against Yugoslavia]]. When Moore asks Manson what he would say to the students at [[Columbine High School|Columbine]], Manson replies, \"I wouldn't say a single word to them; I would listen to what they have to say, and that's what no one did.\"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bowlingforcolumbine.com/media/clips/windowsmedia.php?Clip=manson1021LG|title = Marilyn Manson Interview on Bowling for Columbine|publisher = Bowling for Columbine Official Website|date = 2002-10-11|access-date = 2010-11-15|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110615135947/http://www.bowlingforcolumbine.com/media/clips/windowsmedia.php?Clip=manson1021LG|archive-date = 2011-06-15}}</ref>\n\n''[[South Park]]'' co-creator [[Matt Stone]]\u2014who grew up in Littleton\u2014agreed to talk with Moore about his hometown and the shooting in the film. Although he did not feel that Moore mischaracterized him or his statements in the film, he harbored ill feelings about the cartoon \"A Brief History of the United States of America\". Both Stone and his fellow ''South Park'' creator [[Trey Parker]] felt that the cartoon was done in a style very similar to theirs, and its proximity to Stone's interview may have led viewers to believe that they created the cartoon. \"It was a good lesson in what Michael Moore does in films. He doesn't necessarily say explicitly this is what it is, but he creates meaning where there is none by cutting things together,\" Stone remarked in a later interview.<ref>{{cite news|title=BBC - Movies - Interview - Matt Stone|work=[[BBC]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2005/01/13/matt_stone_team_america_interview.shtml|author= Anwar Brett|date=2005-01-13 |access-date=2016-03-11}}</ref> As a humorous retort to this, Stone and Parker portrayed Moore as \"a gibbering, overweight, hot-dog-eating buffoon\" who ultimately commits a suicide bombing against the protagonists in their 2004 film, ''[[Team America: World Police]]''.<ref name=\"msnbc 6228221\">[https://www.today.com/popculture/team-america-takes-moviegoers-wbna6228221 \u2018Team America\u2019 takes on moviegoers] [[msnbc.com]], October 15, 2004</ref>\n\n===Statistics===\nMoore follows up by exploring popular explanations as to why gun violence is so high in the United States. He examines Marilyn Manson as a cause, but states that more German citizens listen to Marilyn Manson (per capita) and that the country has a larger Goth population than the United States, with less gun violence (Germany: 381 incidents per year). He examines violent movies, but notes that other countries have the same violent movies, showing ''[[The Matrix]]'' with French subtitles (France: 255 incidents per year). He also examines video games, but observes that many violent video games come from Japan (Japan: 39 incidents per year). He concludes his comparisons by considering the suggestion that the United States' violent history is the cause, but notes the similarly violent histories of Germany, Japan, France, and the United Kingdom (68 incidents per year). Moore ends this segment with gun-related-deaths-per-year statistics of the following countries:\n\n* Japan: 39 (0.030/100,000)\n* Australia: 65 (0.292/100,000)\n* United Kingdom: 68 (0.109/100,000)\n* Canada: 165 (0.484/100,000)\n* France: 255 (0.389/100,000)\n* Germany: 381 (0.466/100,000)\n* United States: 11,127 (3.601/100,000)\n\n''[[The American Prospect]]'' published a piece by [[Garance Franke-Ruta]] criticizing the film for ignoring the role that [[Local government|municipal governance]] plays in crime in the United States, and ignoring [[African American|African-American]] urban victims of violence while focusing on the unusual events of Columbine. \"A decline in murders in [[New York City]] alone\u2014from 1,927 in 1993 to 643 in 2001\u2014had, for example, a considerable impact on the declining national rate.

Big Beaver Road|headquarters]] of American superstore [[Kmart (United States)|Kmart]] to claim a refund on the bullets still lodged in their bodies, which were purchased by the perpetrators at a Kmart store. Moore and the victims wait for hours in the building's lobby, speaking to several Kmart employees, who evade the issue. Moore then decides to visit a Kmart in nearby [[Sterling Heights, Michigan|Sterling Heights]], where they purchase the store's entire supply of ammunition, and the three return to the company's headquarters the following day with several members of the local media.

They go inside the large property and sit down to discuss American firearm violence. Heston's response includes the suggestions that the United States has a \"history of violence\" and more \"mixed ethnicity\" than other countries.
