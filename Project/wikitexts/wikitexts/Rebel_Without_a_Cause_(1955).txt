Filmed in the then recently introduced [[CinemaScope]] format and directed by [[Nicholas Ray]], it offered both social commentary and an alternative to previous films depicting delinquents in [[Urban area|urban]] [[slum]] environments.<ref name=\"WVrev\">''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; October 26, 1955, page 6.</ref><ref name=\"HRrev\">''[[Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews|Harrison's Reports]]'' film review; October 22, 1955, page 170.</ref> The film stars [[James Dean]], [[Sal Mineo]], and [[Natalie Wood]].\n\nThe film was a groundbreaking attempt to portray the moral decay of American youth, critique parental style, and explore the [[generation gap|differences and conflicts between generations]]. The title was adopted from psychiatrist [[Robert M. Lindner]]'s 1944 book, ''Rebel Without a Cause: The Hypnoanalysis of a Criminal Psychopath''. The film, however, does not make any references to Lindner's book in any way. [[Warner Bros.]] released the film on October 27, 1955, nearly a month after Dean's death in a car accident on September 30, 1955.\n\nOver the years the film has achieved landmark status for the performance of Dean, fresh from his [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar nominated]] role in ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]'', in his most celebrated role. This was the only film during Dean's lifetime in which he received top billing. In 1990, ''Rebel Without a Cause'' was added to the [[Library of Congress]]'s [[National Film Registry]] as being deemed \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last1=Gamarekian|first1=Barbara|date=1990-10-19|title=Library of Congress Adds 25 Titles to National Film Registry|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/19/movies/library-of-congress-adds-25-titles-to-national-film-registry.html|access-date=2020-08-06|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Image:Virginia Brissac, Jim Backus, Ann Doran, Edward Platt and James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause trailer.jpg|right|thumb|Jim Stark is in police custody.]]\nIn Los Angeles during the mid-1950s, teenager Jim Stark is arrested and taken to the juvenile division of a police station for public intoxication. At the station he crosses paths with John \"Plato\" Crawford, who was brought in for killing a litter of puppies, and Judy, who was brought in for curfew violation. The three each separately reveal their innermost frustrations to the officers; all three of them suffer from problems at home:\n*Jim feels betrayed and anguished by his constantly bickering parents, Frank and Carol, but even more so by his father's timid attitude and failure to stand up to Carol; the issues are further complicated by Frank's interfering mother. His frustrations are made manifest to officer Ray Fremick when Jim is released to their custody.\n*Judy is convinced that her father ignores her because she is no longer a little girl, so she dresses up in racy clothes to get attention, which only causes her father to call her a \"dirty tramp\".\n*Plato's father abandoned his family when he was a toddler, and his mother is often away from home, leaving Plato in the care of his housekeeper.\n\nOn the way to his first day at Dawson High, Jim again meets Judy and offers her a ride. Seemingly unimpressed by Jim at first, she declines and is instead picked up by her \"friends\", a gang of delinquents led by Buzz Gunderson. Jim is shunned by the rest of the student body but is befriended by Plato, who comes to idolize Jim as a father figure.\n\nAfter a [[field trip]] to [[Griffith Observatory]], Buzz provokes and challenges Jim to a knife fight. Jim beats Buzz in the knife fight, so to preserve his status as gang leader, Buzz suggests stealing some cars to have a \"[[chicken (game)|Chickie Run]]\" at a seaside cliff. At home, Jim ambiguously asks his father for advice about defending one's honor in a dangerous situation, but Frank advises him against confrontation of any kind. That night, during the chickie run, Buzz plunges to his death when the strap on his jacket sleeve becomes entangled with his door-latch lever, preventing him from exiting the car in time. As police approach, the gang flees, leaving Judy behind, but Jim patiently persuades her to leave with him and Plato.\n\n[[Image:Ann Doran, James Dean and Jim Backus in Rebel Without a Cause trailer.jpg|right|thumb|Jim confronts his father while his mother watches.]]\nJim later confides to his parents his involvement in the crash and considers turning himself in. When Carol declares they are moving again, Jim protests and pleads with Frank to stand up for him; but when Frank refuses, Jim attacks him in frustration, then storms off to the police station to confess, only to be turned away by the desk sergeant. Jim drives back home, and finds Judy waiting for him. She apologizes for her prior treatment of him due to peer pressure, and the two begin to fall in love. Agreeing that they will never return to their respective homes, Jim suggests they visit an old deserted mansion Plato told him about.\n\nMeanwhile, Plato is intercepted by three members of Buzz's gang, who are convinced that Jim betrayed them to the police. They steal Plato's address book and go off after Jim; Plato retrieves his mother's gun and leaves to warn Jim and Judy, finding them at the mansion. The three new friends act out a fantasy as a family. Plato then falls asleep, and Jim and Judy leave to explore the mansion, where they share their first kiss and voice their love. Buzz's gang find and wake up Plato, who, frightened and distraught, shoots and wounds one of the gang. When Jim returns, he attempts to restrain Plato, but he flees, accusing Jim of leaving him behind.\n\nPlato runs to the observatory and barricades himself inside as more police converge including Fremick who, with Frank and Carol, have been searching for Jim. Jim and Judy follow Plato into the observatory, where Jim persuades Plato to trade the gun for his red jacket; Jim quietly removes the ammunition before returning it, and then convinces Plato to come outside.  But when the police notice that Plato still has the gun they shoot Plato down as he charges them, unaware that Jim had removed the bullets. Frank comforts his grieving son, vowing to be a stronger father. Now reconciled to his parents, Jim introduces them to Judy.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[James Dean]] as Jim Stark\n* [[Natalie Wood]] as Judy\n* [[Sal Mineo]] as John \"Plato\" Crawford\n* [[Jim Backus]] as Frank Stark\n* [[Ann Doran]] as Carol Stark\n* [[Corey Allen]] as Buzz Gunderson\n* [[William Hopper]] as Judy's father\n* [[Rochelle Hudson]] as Judy's mother\n* [[Edward Platt]] as Inspector Ray Fremick\n* [[Marietta Canty]] as the Crawford family maid\n* [[Virginia Brissac]] as Grandma Stark\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as Goon\n* [[Jack Grinnage]] as Moose\n* [[Frank Mazzola]] as Crunch\n* [[Ian Wolfe]] as Dr. Minton, lecturer at planetarium\n* [[Beverly Long (actress)|Beverly Long]] as Helen\n* [[Robert Foulk]] as Gene\n* Jack Simmons as Cookie\n* Tom Bernard as Harry\n* [[Nick Adams (actor, born 1931)|Nick Adams]] as Chick\n* Steffi Sidney as Mil\n* Clifford Morris as Cliff\n}}\n\n==Production==\nWarner Brothers had bought the rights to [[Robert M. Lindner|Lindner's]] book, intending to use the title for a film. Attempts to create a film version in the late 1940s eventually ended without a film or even a full script being produced. When [[Marlon Brando]] did a five-minute [[screen test]] for the studio in 1947, he was given fragments of one of the partial scripts. However, Brando was not auditioning for ''Rebel Without a Cause'', and there was no offer of any part made by the studio. The film, as it later appeared, was the result of a totally new script written in the 1950s that had nothing to do with the Brando test. The screen test is included on a 2006 special edition [[DVD]] of the 1951 film ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]''.\n\nAccording to a biography of Natalie Wood, she almost did not get the role of Judy because Nicholas Ray thought that she did not fit the role of the wild teen character. While on a night out with friends, she got into a car accident. Upon hearing this, Ray rushed to the hospital. While in delirium, Wood overheard the doctor murmuring and calling her a \"goddamn juvenile delinquent\"; she soon yelled to Ray, \"Did you hear what he called me, Nick?!

He originally had written a number of scenes that were shot and later cut from the final version of the film. According to an AFI interview with Stewart Stern, with whom Shulman worked on the screenplay, one of the scenes was thought to be too emotionally provocative to be included in the final print of the film. It portrayed the character of Jim Stark inebriated to the point of belligerence screaming at a car in the parking lot \"It's a little jeep jeep! Little jeep, jeep!\" The scene was considered unproductive to the story's progression by head editor [[William H. Ziegler]] and ultimately was cut. In 2006, members of the [[Film at Lincoln Center|Film Society of Lincoln Center]] petitioned to have the scene printed and archived for historical preservation.\n\nSal Mineo would later note in a 1972 interview that the character of Plato Crawford was intended to have been gay. Speaking to Boze Hadleigh, he said, \"[It m]akes sense [that Plato was killed off]: he was, in a way, the first gay teenager in films. You watch it now, you ''know'' he had the hots for James Dean. You watch it now, and everyone knows about Jimmy['s bisexuality], so it's like he had the hots for Natalie [Wood] and me.

When production began, Warner Bros. considered it a B-movie project, and Ray used black-and-white film stock. When [[Jack L. Warner]] realized James Dean was a rising star and a hot property, filming was switched to color stock, and many scenes had to be reshot in color. It was shot in the widescreen [[CinemaScope]] format, which had been introduced two years previously. With its densely expressive images, the film has been called a \"landmark ... a quantum leap forward in the artistic and technical evolution of a format.\"<ref name=\"ASC\">{{cite journal|title=DVD Playback: Rebel Without a Cause (1955)|journal=American Cinematographer|date=October 2005|volume=86|issue=10}}</ref>\n\nThe 1949 Mercury two-door sedan James Dean drove in the movie is part of the permanent collection at the [[National Automobile Museum]] in Reno, Nevada.\n\n==Reception==\n\nNatalie Wood, Sal Mineo, and Nicholas Ray were nominated for Academy awards for their roles in ''Rebel Without a Cause'', which grossed $7,197,000 in domestic and overseas screenings, making it Warner Bros.' second-biggest box office draw that year.<ref name=\"Carter2008\">{{cite book|author=Graydon Carter|title=Vanity Fair's Tales of Hollywood: Rebels, Reds, and Graduates and the Wild Stories Behind the Making of 13 Iconic Films|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BdCSPtFh69EC&pg=PA71|year=2008|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-311471-0|pages=71\u201372}}</ref> The movie opened to mixed reviews when it was released on October 27, 1955, less than a month after James Dean, whose performance was praised all around by film critics, died on September 30. William Zinsser, however, wrote a scathing review of ''Rebel'' in his ''New York Herald Tribune'' column, concluding his summary of the film's plot with the words, \u201cAll this takes two hours, but it seems more like two days. The movie is written and acted so ineptly, directed so sluggishly, that all names but one will be omitted here. The exception is Dean, the gifted young actor who was killed last month. His rare talent and appealing personality even shine through this turgid melodrama.\"<ref name=\"Carter2008\"/>\n\n[[Bosley Crowther]], writing in ''The New York Times'', described  ''Rebel Without a Cause'' as \"violent, brutal and disturbing\", and as an excessively graphic depiction of teen-agers and their \"weird ways\".  He referred to a \"horrifying duel with switchblades\",  a \"brutal scene\", and  a \"shocking presentation\" of a race in stolen automobiles. Although he admitted that there are moments of accuracy and truth in the film, he found these \"excruciating\", and discerned a \"pictorial slickness\" in the production's use of the CinemaScope process and its filming in the [[widescreen]] format, a slickness he declared was at odds with the realism of Ray's directing. Crowther was not impressed by James Dean's acting, and cited the various mannerisms he believed Dean copied from Marlon Brando, asserting that \"Never have we seen a performer so clearly follow another's style\" and calling Dean's interpretation of the Jim Stark role  a \"clumsy display\".<ref name=\"Crowther1955\">{{cite news |author1=Bosley Crowther |title=The Screen: Delinquency; 'Rebel Without Cause' Has Debut at Astor |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1955/10/27/archives/the-screen-delinquency-rebel-without-cause-has-debut-at-astor.html |work=The New York Times |date=October 27, 1955}}</ref>\n\nReviewer Jack Moffitt of ''The Hollywood Reporter'', who correctly thought the film would be a money maker, wrote a less critical, more laudatory review. He found the acting of James Dean, Natalie Wood, and Sal Mineo to be \"extraordinarily good\", and the direction by Nicholas Ray to be \"outstanding\". He praised the realistic manner in which Ray depicted the police station scenes and the engaging manner, according to Moffitt, in which he captured the nihilism of the teenage subculture for his audience. Moffitt took issue with the underlying ideology of the film, however, especially its implication, as he saw it, that professional bureaucrats could better guide youth than the American family unit itself. He criticized the film for overgeneralizing, calling this aspect a \"convenient cliche\", and summed up his review by describing the film as \"a superficial treatment of a vital problem that has been staged brilliantly\".<ref name=\"Moffitt1955\">{{cite news |author1=Jack Moffitt |title='Rebel Without a Cause': THR's 1955 Review |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/rebel-a-cause-1955-film-review-940868 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=October 21, 1955 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190504190224/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/rebel-a-cause-1955-film-review-940868 |archive-date=4 May 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nRobert J. Landry, managing editor of ''Variety'' magazine at the time, wrote a review published on October 26. He described ''Rebel'' as  a \"fairly exciting, suspenseful and provocative, if also occasionally far-fetched, melodrama of unhappy youth on another delinquency kick.\" Unlike some movie critics, Landry thought that James Dean, under the influence of Nicholas Ray's direction, had mostly freed his acting of the mannerisms characteristic of Marlon Brando's style, and that his performance in the movie was \"very effective\".  He praised Dean's interpretation of a maladjusted teenager, noting his ability \"to get inside the skin\" of his character as \"not often encountered\".<ref name=\"Landry1955\">{{cite magazine |author1=Robert J.
