In it, Martin Sheen's character walks the [[Camino de Santiago]], a traditional pilgrimage route in France and Spain.<ref name=\"ICN\" /><ref name=\"gouverneur\" />\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Thomas Avery is an American ophthalmologist who goes to France following the death of his estranged adult son, Daniel, killed in the [[Pyrenees]] during a storm while walking the ''Camino de Santiago'' (the [[Way of St. James]]), a Christian pilgrimage route to the Cathedral of [[Santiago de Compostela]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Spain. Tom's purpose is initially to retrieve his son's body. However, in a combination of grief and homage to his son, Tom decides to walk the ancient spiritual trail where his son died, taking Daniel's ashes with him.\n\nWhile walking the ''Camino'', Tom meets other people, all looking for greater meaning in their lives. He reluctantly falls in with three other pilgrims in particular. Joost is an overweight man from [[Amsterdam]] who says he is walking the route to lose weight to get ready for his brother's wedding and also so that his wife will desire him again. He is a friendly extrovert who is the first to start walking with Tom. Sarah is a Canadian fleeing an abusive husband, who says she is walking the pilgrimage to quit smoking. Jack is an Irish travel writer who when younger had desires to be a great author like [[William Butler Yeats]] or [[James Joyce]] but never wrote the novel he dreamed of. He is the last to join the quartet and has been suffering from \"[[writer's block]]\". As the pilgrims travel the ''Camino'', they occasionally meet and talk with other pilgrims\u2014two Frenchmen, a young Italian and Father Frank, an elderly priest from New York. Tom occasionally has visions of Daniel alive and smiling among other people. Tom starts out the journey being cold to his fellow pilgrims, but over the course of their journey he eventually opens up to them.\n\nOn the pilgrimage, the group experiences challenges, such as when a young [[Romani people|Romani]] steals Tom's backpack containing his son's ashes. Although the thief escapes, his father drags him back to Tom to return the pack, with embarrassed apologies and an offer in compensation to attend a Romani street party in the evening.\n\nAfter the group arrives at Santiago de Compostela, Tom is ultimately accompanied to [[Mux\u00eda]] by the other three members. There, he scatters the remainder of Daniel's ashes in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nWith Daniel's backpack on his back, Tom is shown happy setting out on another journey, this time in [[Morocco]].\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Martin Sheen]] as Thomas Avery\n*[[Deborah Kara Unger]] as Sarah Marie Sinclair\n*[[James Nesbitt]] as Jack Emerson Stanton\n*[[Yorick van Wageningen]] as Joost Michael de Witt\n*[[Emilio Estevez]] as Daniel Avery\n*[[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo]] as Captain Henri S\u00e9bastien\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe film was inspired by Emilio Estevez's son, Taylor.<ref name=\"AOL\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.aolnews.com/2011/03/01/martin-sheen-in-malta-taking-a-break-from-everything/ |title=Martin Sheen in Malta 'Taking a Break From Everything' |last=Kennedy |first=Dana |date=1 March 2011 |publisher=[[AOL News]] News |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303235425/http://www.aolnews.com/2011/03/01/martin-sheen-in-malta-taking-a-break-from-everything/ |archive-date=3 March 2011 |access-date=5 March 2011}}</ref>  The inspiration for the project happened in 2003.  Taylor, at the time 19 years old, and Sheen, whose [[television program|TV series]]  ''[[The West Wing]]'' was on [[Hiatus (television)|hiatus]], traveled the pilgrimage route. Taylor, who served as an associate producer on the film, had driven the length of the ''Camino'' with his grandfather. On the way, he met the woman who would become his wife; thus, the ''Camino'' held special meaning for him. After the trip, a series of discussions started between Sheen and his son for a movie about the ''Camino de Santiago''.<ref name=\"WM\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bustedhalo.com/features/emilio-estevez-and-the-way |title=Emilio Estevez and The Way |last=Dwyer |first=Fr Dave |date=7 April 2010 |website=bustedhalo.com |access-date=19 March 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"T\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/8385806/The-Way-interview-with-Martin-Sheen-and-Emilio-Estevez.html |title=The Way: interview with Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez |last=McLean |first=Craig |date=21 March 2011 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |access-date=22 March 2011}}</ref> Sheen originally suggested it be a low-budget documentary, but Estevez was not interested in such a small project, wanting instead a bigger experience.<ref name=\"T\" />\n\nEstevez also found inspiration in his vineyard, Casa Dumetz, where he wrote much of the dialogue for the film.<ref name=\"NYT\" />  Exploring the themes of loss, community, and faith, he saw parallels with the characters of the film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939).<ref name=\"T\" /> The script took six months to get a first draft.<ref name=\"ICN\" />\n\nThe story is also based on selected stories from [[Jack Hitt]]'s book ''[[Jack Hitt#Books|Off the Road: A Modern-Day Walk Down the Pilgrim's Route into Spain]]'' (1994).<ref name=\"TheWayReview\">{{cite web|title=The Way: Film Review|date=October 14, 2010|publisher=Hollywood Reporter| author=Kirk Honeycutt|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/way-film-review-30070/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20220717080307/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/way-film-review-30070/|archive-date=July 17, 2022}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming started on 21 September 2009 and took 40 days. The production company and actors walked between 300 and 350 kilometers during filming. Estevez had a very small crew and shot with available light; night-time sequences were filmed by candle and firelight. Considering the ''Camino'' is special to local people on the route, the filmmakers felt great pressure to get the details right.<ref name=\"ICN\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.indcatholicnews.com/news.php?viewStory=17731 |title=A father and son project: Martin Sheen, Emilio Estevez discuss The Way |last=Siedlecka |first=Jo |date=24 February 2011 |publisher=Independent Catholic News |access-date=17 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] interview, a key scene almost did not happen. With church leadership opposed to allowing the crew to shoot inside the famous cathedral in Santiago de Compostela, Estevez says he took a leap of faith and asked everyone on set to pray for access. \"And it worked\", claimed Sheen. The crew was given permission just 48 hours before they were scheduled to shoot the scenes, which they felt were critical to the film.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbn.com/entertainment/screen/emilio-estevez-martin-sheen-faith-the-way-goodwyn.aspx |title=Emilio Estevez and Martin Sheen on Faith and Filming 'The Way |work=CBN.com}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nSheen originally suggested [[Michael Douglas]] or [[Mel Gibson]] for the lead role, but Estevez had written the main character's role specifically for his father.<ref name=\"T\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE0GFhsFcDY  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/aE0GFhsFcDY |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=The Way: Interview with Martin Sheen & Emilio Estevez |last=fbavinton |date=1 March 2011 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=5 March 2011}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Aside from the main actors, those seen on-screen are real pilgrims from all over the world.
