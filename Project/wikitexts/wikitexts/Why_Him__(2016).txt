The film follows a father who tries to stop his daughter's immature tech-millionaire boyfriend from asking her to marry him.\n\nThe film premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on December 17, 2016, was released by [[20th Century Fox]] in the United States on December 23, 2016. It received generally negative reviews from critics, but was a financial success, grossing $118 million worldwide on a $52 million dollar budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nStanford student Stephanie Fleming invites her boyfriend Laird Mayhew over to \"[[Netflix and chill]]\". Meanwhile, back home in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], Stephanie's dad Ned is celebrating his 55th birthday with friends and family at an Applebee's restaurant. During a slideshow presentation in his honor, Stephanie drops in via webcam to congratulate him, when suddenly her boyfriend walks in on her and flashes the camera.\n\nStephanie drives her family&nbsp;\u2013 parents Ned and Barb and younger brother Scotty &nbsp;\u2013 to Laird's villa to meet him. She explains to Ned that Laird is the CEO of a video game company, which has made him extremely wealthy. Laird gives the family a tour of his house, complete with curse words and inappropriate comments about Barb. He then reveals a large tattoo of the Flemings' Christmas card on his back, complete with \"Happy Holidays\" written underneath. In the living room is a tank with a moose filled completely with its urine. The basement has a bowling alley that Laird built with a mural of Ned, posed in a \"crotch-chop\" position.\n\nNed talks to Stephanie about Laird's behavior and she asks him to give him a chance. Later, Laird invites Ned to go for a walk in the woods outside his house and asks Ned for his blessing to propose to Stephanie to marry him. Ned is quick to say no, which completely blindsides Laird, who had been confident that Ned would say yes. Laird promises to win him over.\n\nAs the family gathers in Laird's living room for a Christmas party, Laird reveals that he bought Ned's struggling printing company as a gift to remove all his debts. Instead of expressing gratitude, Ned punches Laird in the face and they begin to fight. Stephanie and Barb are both angry at the partner's behavior, and the family leaves Laird's home.\n\nOn Christmas Day, the Flemings are celebrating without Stephanie. They are surprised when Laird's helicopter arrives with Stephanie. She is still mad at both Ned and Laird for their behavior and refuses to talk to either of them. Ned and Laird talk and Laird gets Ned's blessing to propose to Stephanie. However, Stephanie declines the proposal saying she is not ready to get married, but she wants them to continue dating.\n\nLater during the party, Ned and Scotty approach Laird for a new business idea, since they are all part of the same company now. Scotty says they should sell the same toilets Laird has in his home since they would be very profitable. Laird likes the idea and agrees. The couples then dance together as music plays, with Ned referring to Laird as \"son\".\n\nScotty, Ned, and Laird eventually turn the printing company into a toilet factory and become a profitable company. Stephanie uses the Fleming-Mayhew conglomerate to help underdeveloped countries with their sewage projects. Finally, Laird has what he always wanted, to be part of a family.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[James Franco]] as Laird Mayhew, an eccentric, foul-mouthed CEO of a video game company and Stephanie's boyfriend\n* [[Bryan Cranston]] as Ned Fleming, Stephanie's conservative father and Barb's husband\n* [[Zoey Deutch]] as Stephanie Fleming, Laird's girlfriend, Ned and Barb's daughter, and Scotty's older sister\n* [[Megan Mullally]] as Barb Fleming, Ned's wife and Stephanie's mother\n* [[Cedric the Entertainer]] as Lou Dunne, Patty's husband and Ned's best friend and business partner\n* [[Griffin Gluck]] as Scotty Fleming, Stephanie's 15-year-old younger brother and Ned and Barb's son\n* [[Keegan-Michael Key]] as Gustav, Laird's best friend, butler, assistant and trainer, who also manages his estate\n* Tangie Ambrose as Patty Dunne, Lou's wife \n* [[Zack Pearlman]] as Kevin Dingle, Ned's I.T. guy\n* [[Kaley Cuoco]] as the voice of Justine, Laird's in-home [[artificial intelligence]]\n* [[Casey Wilson]] as Missy Pederman, Blaine's sister and the owner of an online invitation company called StampFree Invites\n* [[Andrew Rannells]] as Blaine Pederman, Missy's brother and business partner\n* [[Adam DeVine]] as Tyson Modell, the creator of the wildly popular Ghostchat app\n* [[Steve Bannos]] as Tree Lot Owner Burt\n* [[Mary Pat Gleason]] as Joyce\n* [[Bob Stephenson (actor)|Bob Stephenson]] as Jerry in Graphics\nThere are cameos by technology, gaming, and entertainment figures, including [[Burnie Burns]], [[Steve Aoki]], [[Richard Blais]], [[Elon Musk]], [[Toby Turner]], and [[Gene Simmons]] and [[Paul Stanley]] of ''[[Kiss (band)|KISS]]''.\n\n== Production ==\nOn November 18, 2014, it was announced that [[John Hamburg]] and Ian Helfer were co-writing a comedy film, ''Why Him?'', for [[20th Century Fox]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Andreeva|first= Nellie|title=John Hamburg Launches Production Company, Inks Overall Deal With 20th TV|url=https://deadline.com/2014/11/john-hamburg-production-company-overall-deal-20th-tv-1201288445/|access-date= August 26, 2015|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date= November 18, 2014}}</ref> On February 27, 2015, [[James Franco]] was in talks to star in the film, playing a young billionaire.<ref name= FrancoCast>{{cite news|last=McNary|first= Dave|title=James Franco in Talks for Comedy 'Why Him?'
