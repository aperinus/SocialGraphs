In 2691, former gym teacher turned terrorist Chuck De Nomolos attacks the Bill & Ted University and steals a time-traveling phone booth, intending to alter the history of what he considers to be a foolish and frivolous society by sending evil robot replicas of Bill and Ted back to the late 20th century to prevent the originals from winning the [[San Dimas, California|San Dimas]] Battle of the Bands. Rufus attempts to stop De Nomolos but seemingly becomes lost in the circuits of time.\n\nIn the present, Wyld Stallyns are auditioning for an upcoming Battle of the Bands. Though Bill and Ted's current girlfriends and former 15th-century princesses Joanna and Elizabeth have become skilled musicians, the duo themselves are still inept. Despite this, the organizer, Ms. Wardroe, assures them a slot in the contest as the final act and informs them that victory will result in a record deal and $25,000 prize money. Following a party, the duo proposes to their fianc\u00e9es right as the evil robots arrive from the future. After luring the real duo away to [[Vasquez Rocks]] and killing them by throwing them over the side of a cliff, the robots begin working to ruin the duo's eventual fame along with their relationships with their fianc\u00e9es.\n\nIn the afterlife, Bill and Ted's [[soul]]s are met by [[Death (personification)|Death]] who says they may challenge him in a game for their souls, but warns that nobody has ever won. Bill and Ted escape after giving Death a \"[[Wedgie|melvin]]\". Attempts to contact the police by possessing Ted's father and a deputy fail, and their next attempt for help at a [[s\u00e9ance]] held by Missy ends with them being sent to Hell. Tormented by Satan and forced to face their own fears, the duo realize their only escape is to take Death's offer; he then appears and allows them to choose a game. To Death\u2019s dismay, they select modern games like [[Battleship (game)|Battleship]], [[Cluedo|Clue]], [[Electric Football]] and [[Twister (game)|Twister]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Flanagan |first=Andrew |date=May 8, 2018 |title=Strange Things Are Afoot: Bill And Ted Set To Return As Dad Rockers |publisher=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2018/05/08/609497035/strange-things-are-afoot-bill-and-ted-set-to-return-as-dad-rockers |access-date=May 9, 2018 |quote=Where ''Bogus Journey'' centralized a parody of Ingmar Bergman's ''The Seventh Seal'' \u2014 pitting the dudes against a pale-faced Death over games of Clue, Twister and Battleship \u2014 the new film...}}</ref> beating him every time. Finally, he reluctantly concedes, placing himself at their command.\n\nRealizing they need to locate the smartest person in the universe to help build robots to counter De Nomolos' evil robots, Death escorts the pair to Heaven. God directs the group to an alien duo named Station, who readily agrees to help them. On the eve of the Battle of the Bands, Bill and Ted are brought back to life; they race to the concert as Station constructs benevolent robot versions of themselves from supplies picked up at a [[Builders Emporium]] store. Elsewhere, the evil robots abduct the girls and tie them high above the stage at the Battle of the Bands, intending to drop them to their deaths at the finale.\n\nBill and Ted arrive just as the evil robots take the stage; the benevolent Good Robots easily defeat their evil counterparts and Joanna and Elizabeth are lowered by Station before their ropes break. De Nomolos appears in the time booth, preparing to kill Bill and Ted himself, and overrides the broadcasting equipment to send a live feed of their confrontation across the entire planet. Bill and Ted deduce that they can go back in time following the encounter to arrange events for De Nomolos to be captured in the present; though De Nomolos attempts to follow suit, the duo turn the tables by explaining that only the winners get to go back. After De Nomolos is \"melvined\" by Death and arrested by Ted's father Captain Logan, Ms. Wardroe reveals herself to be a disguised Rufus, who gives them the stage.\n\nAcknowledging their ineptness, the duo decide to use the time booth; they immediately return to the auditorium with their families, which now include \"Little Ted & Little Bill\", after sixteen months of intense guitar training and a two-week honeymoon. Joined by Death, the Stations and the good robots on stage, Wyld Stallyns perform a stunning rock ballad as De Nomolos' broadcast continues, broadcasting their music worldwide and creating harmony. The victorious Wyld Stallyns encounter many perks of fame that help them to fulfill their destinies and create their utopian society with their music, eventually taking their act to [[Mars]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Ted \"Theodore\" Logan / Evil Ted\n** Brendan Ryan as young Ted\n* [[Alex Winter]] as William S. \"Bill\" Preston / Granny S.

Having enjoyed ''Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure'', he thought the idea of Death as a villain in a comedic film would be a good role for him, auditioning via tape using an accent from Czechoslovakian actor [[Jan T\u0159\u00edska]] with whom he had co-performed in an earlier stage production. When he was called in to audition in person, they had asked him to come in aged makeup; Sadler contacted Scott Eddo, the makeup supervisor for ''[[Die Hard 2]]'' to make him look authentically old, which Sadler believed helped get him the role, along with the humor he injected into the audition. Sadler said that in the film, nearly everything Death does was written into the script, outside of the same accent that he used from his audition forward.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vulture.com/2020/08/william-sadler-interview-playing-death-in-bill-and-ted.html | title = William Sadler Answers Every Question We Have About Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey | first=  Nate | last = Jones | date= August 25, 2020 | access-date = September 3, 2020 | work = [[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]] }}</ref>\n\nThe name \"Station\" was the result of a leftover editing typo, according to the movie's writers [[Chris Matheson (screenwriter)|Chris Matheson]] and [[Ed Solomon]].

Like [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]]'s adaptation of the first [[Star Wars (1977 film)|''Star Wars'']] film, Dorkin worked from the original script, which included many deleted scenes such as the fears from Hell attempting to block Bill and Ted from the concert, and Evil Bill and Ted killing Bill and Ted before they remind the Reaper that they are owed lives from beating him so many times. Death was portrayed as the archetypal skeletal figure. Due to the popularity of the comic, Marvel commissioned a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Comic Book]]'', which kept the talents of Dorkin, DeStefano, and Severin. The series ran for 12 issues, featuring original stories, such as Death taking a vacation, a medieval version of Bill and Ted, Bill and Ted gaining a band manager, a return by De Nomolos, an attempt to stop [[John Wilkes Booth]], and meeting Little Bill and Ted from the future, who in this version were boys.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicvine.gamespot.com/bill-teds-excellent-comic-book/4050-25231/|title=Bill & Ted's Excellent Comic Book (Volume)}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0101452}}\n* {{Amg title|5540}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|id=bill_and_teds_bogus_journey}}\n* {{AFI film|id=58769|title=Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey}}\n\n{{Bill and Ted}}\n{{Peter Hewitt}}\n{{Portalbar|Film|United States|1990s|Comedy}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey}}\n[[Category:1990s buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s road movies]]\n[[Category:1990s science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:1991 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1991 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1991 films]]\n[[Category:American buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:American ghost films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American parody films]]\n[[Category:American road movies]]\n[[Category:American science fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:American teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:Android (robot) films]]\n[[Category:Bill & Ted]]\n[[Category:The Devil in film]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Fiction about God]]\n[[Category:Films about extraterrestrial life]]\n[[Category:Films about the afterlife]]\n[[Category:Films about time travel]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Hewitt]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Newman]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1990]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 27th century]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Ed Solomon]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Scott Kroopf]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Chris Matheson (screenwriter)]]\n[[Category:Interscope Communications films]]\n[[Category:Orion Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Fiction about personifications of death]]\n[[Category:Films about coups d'\u00e9tat]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
