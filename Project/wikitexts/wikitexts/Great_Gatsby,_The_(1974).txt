Scott Fitzgerald]]. The film was directed by [[Jack Clayton]], produced by [[David Merrick]], and written by [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. It stars [[Robert Redford]] in the title role of [[Jay Gatsby]], along with [[Mia Farrow]], [[Sam Waterston]], [[Bruce Dern]], and [[Karen Black]].\n\n''The Great Gatsby'' was preceded by a [[The Great Gatsby (1949 film)|1949 film of the same name]]. Despite a mixed reception by critics, the film grossed over $26 million against a $7 million budget. Coppola later stated that the film failed to follow his screenplay. In 2013, a [[The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|fourth adaptation of the novel]] was later produced.\n\n==Plot==\nWriter [[Nick Carraway]] pilots his boat across the harbor to his cousin [[Daisy Buchanan|Daisy]] and her husband Tom\u2019s mansion in East Egg. While there, he learns Tom and Daisy's marriage is troubled and Tom is having an affair with a woman in [[New York City|New York]]. Nick lives in a small cottage in West Egg, next to a mysterious tycoon named [[Jay Gatsby|Gatsby]], who regularly throws extravagant parties at his home.\n\nTom takes Nick to meet his mistress, Myrtle, who is married to George Wilson, an automotive mechanic. George needs to purchase a vehicle from Tom, but Tom is only there to draw Myrtle to his city apartment. Back on [[Long Island]], Daisy wants to set Nick up with her friend, Jordan, a [[professional golfer]]. When Nick and Jordan attend a party at Gatsby's home, Nick is invited for a private meeting with Gatsby, who asks him to lunch the following day.\n\nAt lunch, Nick meets Gatsby's business partner, a Jewish gangster and a gambler named Meyer Wolfsheim who rigged the [[1919 World Series]]. The following day, Jordan appears at Nick's work and requests he invite Daisy to his house so that Gatsby can meet with her. Gatsby surprises Daisy at lunch, and it is revealed that Gatsby and Daisy were once lovers, though she would not marry him because he was poor.\n\nDaisy and Gatsby have an affair, which soon becomes obvious. While Tom and Daisy entertain Gatsby, Jordan, and Nick at their home, Daisy proposes they go into the city. At the [[Plaza Hotel]], Gatsby and Daisy reveal their affair and Gatsby wants Daisy to admit she never loved Tom. She is unable to and drives off in Gatsby's car. During the drive home, Daisy hits Myrtle when Myrtle runs into the street. Believing that it was Gatsby who killed Myrtle, George later goes to Gatsby's mansion and fatally shoots him as he relaxes in the swimming pool, then commits suicide. Nick holds a funeral for Gatsby where he meets Gatsby's father. No one else attends the funeral. Afterward, Daisy and Tom continue with their lives as though nothing occurred. Nick breaks up with Jordan and moves back west, frustrated with eastern ways.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Robert Redford]] as [[Jay Gatsby]]\n* [[Mia Farrow]] as [[Daisy Buchanan]]\n* [[Bruce Dern]] as Tom Buchanan\n* [[Sam Waterston]] as [[Nick Carraway]]\n* [[Karen Black]] as Myrtle Wilson\n* [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]] as George Wilson\n* [[Lois Chiles]] as Jordan Baker\n* [[Edward Herrmann]] as Ewing Klipspringer\n* [[Howard Da Silva]] as Meyer Wolfsheim\n* [[Kathryn Leigh Scott]] as Catherine Wilson, Myrtle's sister\n* [[Regina Baff]] as Miss Baedecker\n* [[Vincent Schiavelli]] as Thin Man\n* [[Roberts Blossom]] as Mr. Gatz\n* [[Beth Porter]] as Mrs. McKee\n* [[Patsy Kensit]] as Pammy Buchanan\n{{Div col end}}\n\n[[Jack Nicholson]] was offered the role of Jay Gatsby but he declined.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ofpzCwAAQBAJ&q=jack+nicholson+the+sting+turned+down&pg=PT206|title = Jack's Life: A Biography of Jack Nicholson (Updated and Expanded)|isbn = 9780393350975|last1 = McGilligan|first1 = Patrick|date = November 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Screenplay===\n[[Truman Capote]] was the original screenwriter but he was replaced by [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. Coppola had just finished directing ''[[The Godfather]]'' but was unsure of its commercial reception and he needed the money. He believes he got the job on the recommendation of [[Robert Redford]], who had liked a rewrite Coppola did on ''[[The Way We Were]]''. Coppola \"had read Gatsby but wasn't familiar with it.\" He checked himself into a hotel room in Paris ([[Oscar Wilde]]'s old room) and started. He later recalled:\n<blockquote>I was shocked to find that there was almost no dialogue between Daisy and Gatsby in the book, and was terrified that I'd have to make it all up. So I did a quick review of Fitzgerald's short stories and, as many of them were similar in that they were about a poor boy and a rich girl, I helped myself to much of the authentic Fitzgerald dialogue from them. I decided that perhaps an interesting idea would be to do one of those scenes that lovers typically have, where they finally get to be together after much longing, and have a \"talk all night\" scene, which I'd never seen in a film. So I did that \u2013 I think a six-page scene in which Daisy and Gatsby stay up all night and talk. And I remember my wife telling me that she and the kids were in New York when ''The Godfather'' opened, and it was a big hit and there were lines around the block at five theaters in the city, which was unheard of at the time. I said, \"Yeah, yeah, but I've got to finish the Gatsby script.\" And I sent the script in, just in time. It had taken me two or three weeks to complete.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/reviews/a1042/francis-ford-coppola-gatsby-and-me/|last=Coppola|first=Francis Ford|journal=Town & Country|publisher=Hearst|issn=0040-9952 |title=Gatsby and Me|date=16 April 2013|volume=167 |issue=5394 |page=40 |access-date=January 21, 2017|archive-date=February 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202115153/http://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/reviews/a1042/francis-ford-coppola-gatsby-and-me/|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\nOn his commentary track for the [[DVD]] release of ''The Godfather'', Coppola refers to writing the ''Gatsby'' script, adding \"Not that the director paid any attention to it. The script that I wrote did not get made.\"\n\n[[William Goldman]], who loved the novel, said in 2000 that he actively campaigned for the job of adapting the script, but was astonished by the quality of Coppola's work:\n<blockquote>I still believe it to be one of the great adaptations... I called him [Coppola] and told him what a wonderful thing he had done. If you see the movie, you will find all this hard to believe... The director who was hired, Jack Clayton, is a Brit... he had one thing all of them have in their blood: a murderous sense of class... Well, Clayton decided this: that Gatsby's parties were shabby and tacky, given by a man of no elevation and taste. There went the ball game. As shot, they were foul and stupid and the people who attended them were foul and silly, and Robert Redford and Mia Farrow, who would have been so perfect as Gatsby and Daisy, were left hung out to dry. Because Gatsby was a tasteless fool and why should we care about their love? It was not as if Coppola's glory had been jettisoned entirely, though it was tampered with plenty; it was more that the reality and passions it depicted were gone.<ref>{{cite Q|Q60387665|first=William |last=Goldman |location=London |publisher=Bloomsbury |year=2000  |pages=95\u201396|url=https://archive.org/details/whichliediditel00gold/page/n107/mode/2up?q=95  }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Filming===\nThe [[Rosecliff]] and [[Marble House]] mansions in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] and an exterior of [[Linden Place]] mansion in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]], were used for Gatsby's house while scenes at the Buchanans' home were filmed at [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], England. One driving scene was shot in [[Windsor Great Park]], UK. Other scenes were filmed in [[New York City]] and [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mixed reviews, being praised for its faithful interpretation of the novel but also criticized for lacking any true emotion or feelings towards the [[Jazz Age]]. Based on 36 total reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an overall approval rating of 39%, with an average rating of 5/10. The critical consensus reads: \"''The Great Gatsby'' proves that even a pair of tremendously talented leads aren't always enough to guarantee a successful adaptation of classic literary source material.\"<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|1008799-great_gatsby|The Great Gatsby}}</ref> Despite this, the film was a financial success, making $26,533,200<ref name=\"Gross\"/> against a $7 million budget.<ref name=\"Gross\"/>\n\n[[Tennessee Williams]], in his book ''Memoirs'' (p.&nbsp;78), wrote: \"It seems to me that quite a few of my stories, as well as my one acts, would provide interesting and profitable material for the contemporary cinema, if committed to...such cinematic masters of direction as Jack Clayton, who made of ''The Great Gatsby'' a film that even surpassed, I think, the novel by Scott Fitzgerald.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Tennessee |title=Memoirs|year=1975 |publisher= Doubleday & Co}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Sinyard |first=Neil |title=Jack Clayton |year=2000 |publisher= Manchester University Press |location=UK |isbn=0-7190-5505-9 |pages=289}}</ref>\n\n[[Vincent Canby]]'s 1974 review in ''The New York Times'' typifies the critical ambivalence: \"The sets and costumes and most of the performances are exceptionally good, but the movie itself is as lifeless as a body that's been too long at the bottom of a swimming pool,\" Canby wrote at the time. \"As Fitzgerald wrote it, ''The Great Gatsby'' is a good deal more than an ill-fated love story about the cruelties of the idle rich...The movie can't see this through all its giant closeups of pretty knees and dancing feet. It's frivolous without being much fun.\"<ref>[[Vincent Canby|Canby, Vincent]] (1974). \"A Lavish ''Gatsby'' Loses Book's Spirit\". ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 28, 1974</ref>\n\n[[Stanley Kauffmann]] of ''The New Republic'' wrote: \"In sum this picture is a total failure of every requisite sensibility.

The fascinating physical beauty of the $6 million-plus film complements the utter shallowness of most principal characters from the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel. Robert Redford is excellent in the title role, the mysterious gentleman of humble origins and bootlegging connections...The Francis Ford Coppola script and Jack Clayton's direction paint a savagely genteel portrait of an upper class generation that deserved in spades what it received circa 1929 and after.\"<ref>''Variety'' staff, (1973). \"Review: ''The Great Gatsby''\". ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', December 31, 1973</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the movie two and a half stars out of four. Comparing film to the book details, Ebert stated: \"The sound track contains narration by Nick that is based pretty closely on his narration in the novel. But we don't feel. We've been distanced by the movie's overproduction. Even the actors seem somewhat cowed by the occasion; an exception is Bruce Dern, who just goes ahead and gives us a convincing Tom Buchanan.\"<ref>Ebert, Roger. \"[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-great-gatsby-1974 ''The Great Gatsby'' Movie Review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723063305/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-great-gatsby-1974 |date=July 23, 2013 }}\".
