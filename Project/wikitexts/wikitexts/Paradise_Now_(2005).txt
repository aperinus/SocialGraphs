It won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] and was nominated for an Academy Award in the same category.\n\n\"The film is an artistic point of view of that political issue,\" Abu-Assad said. \"The politicians want to see it as black and white, good and evil, and art wants to see it as a human thing\".<ref name=Glaister>Glaister, Dan.

It focuses on what would be their last days together.\n\nTheir handlers from an unidentified resistance group tell them the attack will take place the next day. The pair record videos glorifying [[God in Islam|God]] and their cause, and bid their unknowing families and loved ones goodbye, while trying to behave normally to avoid arousing suspicion. The next day, they shave off their hair and beards and don suits in order to look like Israelis. Their cover story is that they are going to a wedding.\n\nAn [[explosive belt]] is attached to each man; the handlers are the only ones with the keys needed to remove the belts without detonating them. The men are instructed to detonate the bombs at the same place, a military check point in Israel, with a time interval of 15 minutes so that the second bomb will kill police arriving after the first blast.\n\nThey cross the Israeli border, but have to flee from guards. Khaled returns to their handlers, who have fled by the time Said arrives. The handlers remove Khaled's explosive belt and issue a search for Said. Khaled believes he is the best person to find Said since he knows him well, and he is given until the end of that day to find him.\n\nAfter Said escapes from the guards, he approaches an [[Israeli settlement]]. At one point, he considers detonating the bomb on a commercial bus, but he decides not to when he sees a child on board. Eventually, Said reveals his reason for taking part in the suicide bombing. While in a car with Suha, a woman he has fallen in love with, he explains that his father was an ''ameel'' (a \"collaborator\", or Palestinian working for the Israelis), who was executed for his actions.  He blames the Israelis for taking advantage of his father's weakness.\n\nKhaled eventually finds Said, who is still wearing the belt and about to detonate it while lying on his father's grave. They return to the handlers, and Said convinces them that the attack need not be canceled, because he is ready for it.  They both travel to Tel Aviv. Influenced by Suha, who discovered their plan, Khaled cancels his suicide attack. Khaled tries to convince Said to back off as well. However, Said manages to shake Khaled by pretending to agree.\n\nThe film ends with a long shot of Said sitting on a bus carrying Israeli soldiers, slowly zooming in on his eyes, and then suddenly cuts to white.\n\n==Production==\n[[Hany Abu-Assad]] and co-writer [[Bero Beyer]] started working on the script in 1999, but it took them five years to get the story before cameras. The original script was about one man searching for his friend, who is a suicide bomber, but it evolved into a story of two friends, Said and Khaled.\n\nThe filmmakers faced great difficulties making the film on location.

An earlier Palestinian film, ''[[Divine Intervention (2002 film)|Divine Intervention]]'' (2002), had controversially failed to gain admission to the competition, allegedly because films nominated for this award must be put forward by the government of their country, and Palestine's status as a [[sovereign state]] is disputed. However, since entities such as [[Puerto Rico]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]] have been submitting entries for years although they are not sovereign states with full [[United Nations]] representation, accusations of a [[double standard]] were made.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://electronicintifada.net/content/oscars-double-standard-turns-palestinian-film-refugee/4264 |title=Oscars' double standard turns Palestinian film into refugee |last1=Doherty |first1=Benjamin J |last2=Abunimah |first2=Ali |date=10 December 2002 |website=The Electronic Intifada |access-date=6 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Paradise Now'' was submitted to the Academy and to the Golden Globes as a film from 'Palestine'.

However, [[Israel]]i officials, including [[Consul General]] Ehud Danoch and Consul for Media and Public Affairs Gilad Millo, tried to extract a guarantee from the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] that ''Paradise Now'' would not be presented in the ceremony as representing the state of Palestine, despite the fact it was introduced as such in the Academy Awards' official website.<ref>{{cite web|author=D\u00fcnya Namaz Vakitleri |url=http://www.zaman.com/?bl=international&alt=&trh=20060213&hn=29733 |title=zaman.com |website=zaman.com |access-date=2012-10-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716191242/http://www.zaman.com/?bl=international&alt=&trh=20060213&hn=29733 |archive-date=2012-07-16 }}</ref> The Academy Awards began to refer to the film's country instead as \"the [[Palestinian Authority]]\".
