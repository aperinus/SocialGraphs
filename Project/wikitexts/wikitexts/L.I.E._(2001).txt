The film was directed by [[Michael Cuesta]], who has said that the film is about exploring sexuality.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[New Yorker Films]]. DVD release, ''L.I.E.'' ([[Audio commentary]]). June 4, 2002.</ref> It stars [[Paul Dano]] in his first lead role as the boy Howie, and [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as John.\n\n==Plot==\nHowie Blitzer is deeply affected by the death of his mother in a car accident on the Long Island Expressway. His situation is exacerbated by his acrimonious relationship with his distant father Marty, who brought a trophy girlfriend into the house less than a month after his wife's death. Howie's only solace is the company of his best friend Gary, a juvenile delinquent and [[Male prostitute|hustler]]. Although Gary is attracted to Howie, Howie is unsure of his own sexuality. They have two other friends their age, one of whom has an incestuous relationship with his sister. The four boys routinely break into neighborhood houses.\n\nOne night, they break into the house of \"Big John\" Harrigan during his birthday party. Gary knows his way around the house; it is later revealed that Big John is one of his steady clients. Big John interrupts them, and they narrowly escape with a pair of rare and valuable [[TT pistol|Russian pistols]]. John later confronts Gary over the burglary and Gary names Howie as his accomplice.\n\nPretending to be a friend of Howie's mother, John introduces himself and invites Howie back to his house. Once there, he confronts Howie about the burglary, demanding the return of the guns. Howie can retrieve only one of them from Gary's room, so John demands $1000 for the other; Howie can only offer to work off the debt. Putting on a pornographic video, John hints that Howie can repay him with sex. Howie hastily leaves, but after returning home, masturbates to a fantasy involving John and the girl in the video.\n\nGary steals money from Howie's father and disappears to Los Angeles, leaving Howie alone. John and Howie begin a tenuous friendship in which John becomes a kind of father figure to him. There is no sexual activity, but there is talk of sex. Howie realizes that he wields a degree of sexual power over John, something John is aware of. Howie stays over at John's house, temporarily displacing John's 19-year-old lover Scott, who warns Howie not to take John from him. Howie discovers a stash of child pornography in the house, including photos of a younger Gary as a blond 11-year-old boy.\n\nHowie's father happens to see him skipping school and losing his temper, he hits the boy. Later that day, he is arrested for dangerous practices in his construction business, and when Howie returns home to find him missing, he believes his father has abandoned him. He goes to John, approaching him in his bedroom wearing just his underpants, expecting they will have sex. But John explains to Howie what happened with his father, and the boy breaks down and cries. John leaves Howie to sleep by himself.\n\nThe next morning, John is all charm, fixing Howie breakfast and taking him to see his father in jail. Howie's father apologizes for hitting him and promises to spend more time with him once he is out of prison. Howie is unconvinced, and merely tells his father never to hit him again.\n\nAfter dropping Howie off, John returns to the local rest area where young hustlers connect with johns and sits in his car. Scott, devastated by John's abandonment, drives by and shoots him dead.\n\nIn the final scene, Howie contemplates the expressway, vowing he would not let it get him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Big John Harrigan\n* [[Paul Dano]] as Howie Blitzer\n* [[Billy Kay (actor)|Billy Kay]] as Gary Terrio\n* [[Bruce Altman]] as Marty Blitzer\n* Walter Masterson as Scott\n* James Costa as Kevin Cole\n* [[Adam LeFevre]] as Elliot\n* Tony Donnelly as Brian\n* [[B.
