Although the title is adapted from [[Ian Fleming]]'s 1960 short story \"[[From a View to a Kill]]\", the film has an entirely original screenplay. In ''A View to a Kill'', Bond is pitted against [[Max Zorin]] (played by [[Christopher Walken]]), who plans to destroy California's [[Silicon Valley]].\n\nThe film was produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Michael G. Wilson]], who also wrote the screenplay with [[Richard Maibaum]]. It was the third James Bond film to be directed by [[John Glen (director)|John Glen]], and the last to feature [[Lois Maxwell]] as [[Miss Moneypenny]].\n\nDespite receiving mixed reviews from critics, who frequently took umbrage with the effects of Moore's advanced age on his performance, it was a commercial success, with the [[Duran Duran]] theme song \"[[A View to a Kill (song)|A View to a Kill]]\" performing well in the charts, becoming the only Bond theme song to reach number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and earning a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Song]].\n\n==Plot==\nMI6 agent James Bond is sent to [[Siberia]] to locate the body of 003 and recover a Soviet [[Integrated circuit|microchip]]. [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] analyzes the microchip, establishing it to be a copy of one designed to withstand an [[electromagnetic pulse]], made by government contractor Zorin Industries. Bond visits [[Ascot Racecourse]] to observe the company's owner, Max Zorin. Sir Godfrey Tibbett, a racehorse trainer and MI6 agent, believes Zorin's horses, which win consistently, are drugged, although tests proved negative. Through Tibbett, Bond meets with French private detective Achille Aubergine, who informs Bond that Zorin is holding a horse sale later in the month. During their dinner at the [[Eiffel Tower]], Aubergine is assassinated by Zorin's bodyguard [[May Day (James Bond)|May Day]], who subsequently escapes.\n\nBond and Tibbett travel to Zorin's estate for the horse sale. Bond is puzzled by a woman who rebuffs him; he discovers Zorin has written her a cheque for $5 million. That night, Bond and Tibbett infiltrate Zorin's laboratory, where he is implanting [[adrenaline]]-releasing devices in his horses. Zorin identifies Bond as an agent, has May Day assassinate Tibbett, and attempts to have Bond killed. [[List of James Bond allies#General Anatoly Gogol|General Gogol]] of the [[KGB]] confronts Zorin for trying to kill Bond without permission, revealing that Zorin was initially trained and financed by the KGB, but has now gone rogue. Later, Zorin unveils to a group of investors his plan to destroy [[Silicon Valley]], which will give him and the potential investors a monopoly over microchip manufacture.\n\nBond travels to San Francisco and meets with CIA agent Chuck Lee, who says that Zorin is the product of [[Nazi human experimentation|medical experimentation]] with steroids performed by Dr. Carl Mortner, a Nazi scientist who is now Zorin's veterinarian and racehorse-breeding consultant. Bond then investigates a nearby oil rig owned by Zorin, and while there finds KGB agent Pola Ivanova recording conversations and her partner, Klottoff, placing explosives on the rig. Klottoff is caught and killed by Zorin, but Ivanova and Bond escape. Later Ivanova takes the recording but finds that Bond had switched tapes with one of Japanese music.\n\nBond tracks down state geologist [[Stacey Sutton]], the woman Zorin attempted to pay off, and discovers that Zorin is trying to buy her family's oil business. The two travel to [[San Francisco City Hall]] to check Zorin's submitted plans. Having been alerted to their presence, Zorin kills the Chief Geologist, traps Bond in a lift between floors, and sets fire to the building to both frame Bond for the murder and kill him. Bond and Stacey flee from the police in a fire engine to Zorin's mine.\n\nInfiltrating Zorin's mine, Bond and Stacey discover his plot to detonate explosives beneath the lakes along the [[Hayward Fault Zone|Hayward]] and [[San Andreas Fault|San Andreas]] faults, which will cause them to flood and submerge Silicon Valley. A larger bomb is also in the mine to destroy a \"geological lock\" that prevents the two faults from moving simultaneously. Once in place, Zorin and his security chief Scarpine flood the mine and kill the workers. Stacey escapes while Bond fights May Day; after realising Zorin abandoned her, she helps Bond remove the larger bomb, putting the device onto a handcar and riding it out of the mine, where it explodes and kills her.\n\nEscaping in his airship with Scarpine and Mortner, Zorin abducts Stacey while Bond grabs hold of the airship's mooring rope. Zorin tries to knock him off, but Bond moors the airship to the framework of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. Stacey attacks Zorin to save Bond, and in the fracas, Mortner and Scarpine are temporarily knocked out. Stacey flees and joins Bond out on the bridge, but Zorin follows them out with an axe. The ensuing fight between Zorin and Bond culminates with Zorin falling to his death in the sea. Mortner attempts to kill Bond with dynamite, but Bond cuts the airship free, causing Mortner to drop the dynamite in the cabin, whereupon it promptly detonates, blowing up the airship and killing himself and Scarpine. Later, General Gogol awards Bond the [[Order of Lenin]] for foiling Zorin's scheme, whilst Bond romances Stacey at her home.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Roger Moore]] as [[Portrayal of James Bond in film|James Bond]], [[MI6]] agent 007\n<!-- opening title card -->\n* [[Tanya Roberts]] as [[Stacey Sutton]], the granddaughter of an oil tycoon whose company is taken over by Zorin.\n* [[Grace Jones]] as [[May Day (James Bond)|May Day]], Zorin's lover and chief henchwoman.\n* [[Patrick Macnee]] as Sir Godfrey Tibbett, Bond's ally, a horse trainer who helps him infiltrate Zorin's chateau and stables.\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as [[Max Zorin]]: a psychopathic industrialist, the product of a Nazi genetic experiment, who plans to destroy Silicon Valley to gain a monopoly in the microchip market.\n<!-- with -->\n* [[Patrick Bauchau]] as Scarpine, Zorin's murderous loyal associate.\n* [[David Yip]] as Chuck Lee, a CIA agent who assists Bond and Sutton in San Francisco.\n<!-- more opening title cards -->\n* [[Desmond Llewelyn]] as [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], an [[MI6]] officer in charge of the research and development branch.

He was quoted as saying, \"I was horrified on the last Bond I did. Whole slews of sequences where Christopher Walken was machine-gunning hundreds of people. I said 'That wasn't Bond, those weren't Bond films.' It stopped being what they were all about.

You go to a Bond picture expecting some style or, at least, some flash, some lift; you don't expect the dumb police-car crashes you get here. You do see some ingenious daredevil feats, but they're crowded together and, the way they're set up, they don't give you the irresponsible, giddy tingle you're hoping for.\" Kael also singled out the dispirited direction and the hopeless script. \"Director John Glen stages the slaughter scenes so apathetically that the picture itself seems dissociated. (I don't think I've ever seen another movie in which race horses were mistreated and the director failed to work up any indignation. If Glen has any emotions about what he puts on the screen, he keeps them to himself.)\"<ref name=\"Kael (1985)\">{{cite news|last=Kael |first=Pauline|author-link=Pauline Kael|title=Slaphappy and Not So Happy|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=3 June 1985}} [http://www.geocities.ws/paulinekaelreviews/v.html Available online.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225152810/http://www.geocities.ws/paulinekaelreviews/v.html|date=25 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nHowever, not all reviews were negative. Lawrence O'Toole of ''[[Maclean's]]'' believed it was one of the series' best entries. \"Of all the modern formulas in the movie industry, the James Bond series is among the most pleasurable and durable. Lavish with their budgets, the producers also bring a great deal of craft, wit and a sense of fun to the films. Agent 007 is like an old friend who an audience meets for drinks every two years or so; he regales them with tall tales, winking all the time. The 14th and newest Bond epic, ''A View to a Kill'', is an especially satisfying encounter. Opening with a breathtaking ski chase in Siberia, ''A View to a Kill'' is the fastest Bond picture yet. Its pace has the precision of a Swiss watch and the momentum of a greyhound on the track. There is a spectacular chase up and down the Eiffel Tower and through Paris streets, which Bond finishes in a severed car on just two wheels. But none of the action prepares the viewer for the heart-stopping climax with Zorin's dirigible tangled in the cables on top of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge.\" And although O'Toole believed that Moore was showing his age in the role, \"there are plenty of tunes left in his violin. James Bond is still a virtuoso, with a licence to thrill.\"<ref name=\"O'Toole (1985)\">{{cite news|last=O'Toole|first=Lawrence|title=A View to a Kill|newspaper=[[Maclean's]]|date=10 June 1985}}</ref>\n\nBrian J.
