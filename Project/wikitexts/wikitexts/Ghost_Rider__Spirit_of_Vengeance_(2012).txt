The film was directed by [[Neveldine/Taylor|Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor]], from a screenplay written by [[Scott M. Gimple]], Seth Hoffman, and [[David S. Goyer]]. Released publicly for one night on December 11, 2011, ''Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance'' had its wide commercial release on February 17, 2012 in 2D and [[3D film|3D]]. It is the second of two films to be produced under the [[Marvel Knights#Film|Marvel Knights]] production banner, which focuses on films for mature audiences, with the other film being ''[[Punisher: War Zone]]''.\n\nThe film experienced worse critical reception than the first film, with criticism being aimed towards the script, CGI, and acting.<ref name=\"tomatoes\"/> The film grossed more than $132 million, against its $57\u201375 million production budget.<ref name=\"mojo\"/>\n\nNicolas Cage stated that he was \"done\" with the [[Ghost Rider#Film|''Ghost Rider'' films]] and a planned sequel was cancelled.

They seek to kidnap a young boy named [[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Danny]] and perform a ceremony on him that will allow the aging Roarke to transfer himself into Danny's body. A firefight ensues, and Danny is able to escape with his mother Nadya. Moreau decides to seek out [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]], who is currently in hiding to prevent the Rider from running amok. Moreau offers to restore Johnny's soul and remove the Ghost Rider's curse in exchange for the Rider's help finding Danny.\n\nNadya and Danny are captured by Nadya's former boyfriend, Ray Carrigan. He is about to execute Nadya when the Ghost Rider appears, killing several of Carrigan's men. Nadya distracts the Ghost Rider, who is shot with grenades. Nadya escapes but Danny is recaptured. Carrigan informs Roarke about the Rider's interference and Roarke places a spell on Danny to stop the Rider from tracking him. Meanwhile, Blaze awakens in a hospital and leaves, following Nadya and convincing her to accept his help. Nadya explains that she made a deal with Roark as well, and that Danny is Roarke's son.\n\nThat night, Nadya and Johnny interrogate a contact of Carrigan's and Johnny takes off to find Carrigan. The Rider emerges and takes on Carrigan's men, using an empowered [[Bagger 288|mining machine]] to destroy their hideout and mortally wound Carrigan. The Rider turns on Nadya and attempts to use the Penance Stare on her but Danny is able to stop him. Roarke finds Carrigan nearly dead and revives him, granting him the ability to decay anything he touches. Johnny and Nadya bring Danny to the monastery, where Moreau explains that the Ghost Rider is an angel named [[Zarathos]] who was tortured and driven insane in Hell. Moreau tells Johnny that he can exorcise the spirit if Johnny tells a secret only he knows. Johnny confesses that his deal with Roarke was a selfish one: His father had accepted his cancer and was ready to die, but Johnny could not accept it.  Moreau exorcises the spirit, and Johnny becomes human again. The head monk Methodius tries to kill Danny but Carrigan intervenes, killing the monks and recapturing Danny.\n\nThe ritual to transfer Roarke into Danny's body begins while Johnny, Nadya, and Moreau secretly infiltrate the ceremony. Carrigan kills Moreau while Danny returns the Ghost Rider to Johnny. Danny grants the Rider the ability to stay in Rider form even in broad daylight, the Rider then pursues Roarke. The Rider kills Carrigan and flips the car that Roarke and Danny are in before using his chain to hurl Roark back to Hell. With Roarke defeated, Zarathos regains his sanity and is restored to his previous incarnation as the Spirit of Justice. Channeling the blue flame of Zarathos, Johnny revives Danny. As the film ends, Johnny is seen riding down the road in Rider form, but the flames on his bike and body are now blue.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze / Ghost Rider]]: A motorcycle stunt man who sold his soul to the devil to save his father from cancer, and became the devil's servant called the Spirit of Vengeance, a fiery spirit that feeds on the evil of its victims.\n** Ionut Cristian Lefter as Young Johnny Blaze.
