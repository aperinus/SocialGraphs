Based on the 1985 novel ''[[Heat (Goldman novel)|Heat]]'' by [[William Goldman]], it is a remake of [[Heat (1986 film)|the 1986 adaptation]] that starred [[Burt Reynolds]].<ref>{{cite web|title='Heat' Remake: Jason Statham Cast in Update to 1986 Film Starring Burt Reynolds|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2013/04/12/heat-movie-remake_n_3070096.html|publisher=news.moviefone.com|access-date=May 8, 2013}}</ref> The film was released in the United States on January 30, 2015 in a [[limited release]] and through [[video on demand]].\n\n''Wild Card'' received negative reviews and was a [[box-office bomb]], making only $6.7 million worldwide against a $30 million budget.<ref name=\"bom\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nNick Wild is a recovering [[Gambling addiction|gambling addict]] who takes odd jobs in [[Las Vegas]] as a \"''[[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]]''\" (his version of a [[bodyguard]]) to support his addiction. After helping a client impress a woman, he accepts a proposition from a young man, Cyrus Kinnick, to show him around Vegas and provide protection while he gambles.\n\nWhile eating at a diner, Nick's waitress friend Roxy hands him a message from a woman he knows, Holly, who wants him to stop by her house. Holly, a professional escort, explains she had a date the previous night at the [[Golden Nugget Las Vegas|Golden Nugget]]. Afterward, she was brutally raped and beaten by three unknown men in their hotel room. Holly asks Nick to find out who they are so that she can sue them.\n\nNick discovers that the man responsible for raping Holly is Danny DeMarco, a gangster, who had two of his thugs dump her in a hospital car park. Nick goes to the hotel to confront DeMarco and a confrontation develops, resulting in Nick overpowering DeMarco and his men, who are tied up. Nick calls Holly, who contemplates castrating DeMarco, who then breaks down and begs her forgiveness. Holly decides to just take the $50,000 from DeMarco's desk and leaves.\n\nHolly splits the money with Nick and leaves Las Vegas. Nick takes Cyrus to a casino and whilst playing [[blackjack]] with dealer friend Cassandra, Nick goes on a huge winning streak with the next dealer, amassing over a half a million dollars. But when he goes to the cashier, he has a sudden anxiety attack and decides to keep on gambling, eventually losing all his winnings (as well as his original $25,000) on a single blackjack bet with Cassandra. The next morning, Cyrus, revealed to be a self-made millionaire, wants Nick to mentor him on being brave, but Nick declines. At the bar, DeMarco's men arrive to deliver Nick to DeMarco, but Nick fends them off.\n\nNick meets with Baby, the mafia boss of Las Vegas. Baby has received a complaint from DeMarco, who claims that Nick broke into his hotel room, pistol-whipped him, and killed two of his men \u2013 all to fund his gambling addiction. Baby takes Nick to a room with DeMarco, where Nick tells his side of the story: that DeMarco killed his own men, to save face after begging for his life, and that DeMarco bears a cut on his penis. Baby tells DeMarco to drop his pants to prove Nick wrong, but he refuses and leaves.\n\nAt the local diner, Cyrus offers Nick a check for $500,000 and a plane ticket to [[Corsica]] for what he has learned from Nick. DeMarco and his men appear in the diner. Cyrus shows his newfound manliness by singing loudly as a distraction so Nick can escape. Nick thinks about his sailboat and then kills the thugs and DeMarco with his utensils behind the diner.\n\nAfterwards, Cyrus insists Nick take the check and the ticket, and Nick accepts. Nick then drives out of Las Vegas.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- opening credits order -->\n* [[Jason Statham]] as Nick Wild\n* [[Michael Angarano]] as Cyrus Kinnick\n* [[Milo Ventimiglia]] as Danny DeMarco\n* [[Dominik Garcia-Lorido]] as Holly\n* [[Anne Heche]] as Roxy\n* [[Sof\u00eda Vergara]] as DD\n* [[Max Casella]] as Osgood\n* [[Jason Alexander]] as Pinky\n<!-- listed 2 at a time -->\n* Francois Vincentelli as Benny\n* Daviena McFadden as Millicent\n<!-- listed 3 at a time -->\n* [[Chris Browning]] as Tiel\n* [[Matt Willig|Matthew Willig]] as Kinlaw\n* Grieice Santo as Cocktail Waitress\n<!-- with  -->\n* [[Hope Davis]] as Cassandra\n<!-- and -->\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Baby\n* [[Michael Papajohn]] as Pit Boss\n* [[Lara Grice]] as First Doctor\n\n==Production==\n[[Simon West]] said that [[Jason Statham]] developed the project himself \"maybe over five years\".<ref name=\"west\"/> At one point, [[Brian De Palma]] was slated to direct until West replaced him.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Cain|title=Simon West Replaces Brian De Palma On 'Heat' Remake Starring Jason Statham|date=November 2, 2012|publisher=[[IndieWire]]|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/simon-west-replaces-brian-de-palma-on-heat-remake-starring-jason-statham-20121102|access-date=January 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104224120/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/simon-west-replaces-brian-de-palma-on-heat-remake-starring-jason-statham-20121102|archive-date=4 November 2012}}</ref> West stated:\n\n{{blockquote|He [Statham] showed it to me once when we were doing ''Mechanic'', but I was off doing something else, but then he showed it to me again after ''[[Expendables 2]]'' and I got into it, because of the writing really. [[William Goldman]] is a hero of mine ... I actually worked with him on ''[[The General's Daughter (film)|The General's Daughter]]''. He did [[plot hole]] work on the script. So this was a chance to work with him on a whole script \u2013 not just a polish on a script.<ref name=\"west\">[http://www.liveforfilms.com/2014/07/31/director-simon-west-talks-to-us-about-his-new-film-salty-directing-con-air-and-statham/ \"Director Simon West talks to us about his new film Salty, directing Con Air and STATHAM!\", ''Live For Films''] accessed 13 December 2014</ref>}}\n\nWest said the script filmed was the one Goldman wrote over thirty years ago. He later elaborated:\n\n<blockquote>I rang him up and said, \"I'm about to put the record straight and fix this film for you.\" I did ask him, what's your one piece of advice for me when shooting this? He said, \"Just make sure that Nick is the toughest guy you've ever seen in your life.\" That, I think is his approach \u2013 no matter how complicated the character is intellectually, no matter how much dialogue there is, or twists and turns Goldman puts in the script, at the end of the day, he has this one thing that he has above his desk that reminds him what the character should be. It was the same for me \u2013 once he told me that, \"Nick's the toughest guy in Vegas\", every scene informs that. Even when he's not doing anything, everybody in the room knows that, and everybody knows his history, what he's capable of. And so he ultimately doesn't have to do that much, because he is the toughest guy in Vegas.<ref name=\"den\"/></blockquote>\n\n\"It was nice firstly to have a script that was so set, because on any big movie scripts are constantly in flux,\" said West. \"It also made it easy to sell to actors like Stanley Tucci and Sofia Vergara because their parts were very set out. There's nothing in the script that's really aged, there's no pyrotechnics or technology really.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmv.com/video/-i-wanted-to-do-this-great-story-justice-hmv-com-talks-to-wild-card-director-simon-west|title=\"I wanted to do this great story justice...\" \u2013 hmv.com talks to Wild Card director Simon West|work=hmv.com|access-date=February 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began in early 2013 in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jason Alexander, Max Casella Join 'Heat' (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/heat-jason-alexander-max-casella-1200467384/|access-date=May 8, 2013|newspaper=variety.com|date=May 6, 2013}}</ref> The principal photography began in February 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=JASON STATHAM'S 'HEAT' REMAKE GETS A NEW DIRECTOR|url=http://screencrush.com/jason-statham-heat-director/|access-date=May 9, 2013|newspaper=screencrush.com|date=November 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSimon West said the three fights were \"character driven\".\n\n<blockquote>each one of the action moments is character-driven, so you're right, it builds up. So when it does explode, it's exploding for the right reason. The first one, he's getting back into his old skills \u2013 precision fighting. The only way he's going to get out alive is by relying on his old skills. And he's a master of that. The second fight explodes out of anger, and it's really anger at himself for going back to being a gambling addict. They're character-driven fights. Whereas traditionally in action films, they're light relief \u2013 they're almost commercial breaks in the story. These ones come out of the situation his character's in, not just that he's in jeopardy and has to fight his way out of it \u2013 they're emotional fights.<ref name=\"den\">{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/simon-west/34566/simon-west-interview-wild-card-statham-action-the-blob#ixzz3ssf8IYdk|title=Simon West interview: Wild Card, Statham, action, The Blob|work=denofgeek.com|date=March 19, 2015 |access-date=February 26, 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Marketing==\nThe trailer for ''Wild Card'' debuted on December 12, 2014. West later recalled:\n\n{{blockquote|It was a formidable thing, there are pages and pages of dialogue {{ndash}} it's a drama really. It's not an action film really, it's a character piece. Jason [Statham] is the lead in every scene and he has huge dialogue scenes. I knew he was passionate about it, but was like, \"Are you happy with all this dialogue stuff?\" and he said, \"Yes, yes. I love it. I want to do it.\" So I turned up on the first day not knowing what it was going to turn out like. Especially after ''The Mechanic'' where he only has five lines in the whole film! That character has no dialogue. But we turned up on the first day and he knew every word by heart and was amazing. So, ''Wild Card'', I think will surprise a lot of people {{ndash}} it's a very strong dramatic piece by him. There are, of course, also two or three fights! I think some of his best fights ever are in it. They're very realistic and we spent a lot of time on them, so they're very detailed and very well executed I think. But it's a great performance, and he's surrounded by some very cool actors: Stanley Tucci, Anne Heche, Sofia Vergara ... he's in a proper actor's environment and he really stepped up. I was amazed. I think this is just the beginning for him, I think you'll see a lot more dramatic stuff from him.<ref name=\"west\"/>}}\n\n==Release==\n[[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]] released the film in a [[limited release]] and through [[Video on demand|on demand]] on January 30, 2015.<ref>{{cite news |date= December 1, 2014 |last= Evry |first= Max |title= First Look at Jason Statham in Wild Card |url= http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/387639-first-look-at-jason-statham-in-wild-card#/slide/1 |publisher= Comingsoon.net |access-date= December 2, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Wild Card'' was a [[box office bomb]], making only $6.7&nbsp;million against a $30&nbsp;million budget.<ref name=\"bom\"/><ref name=\"numbers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Wild-Card#tab=summary|title=Wild Card (2015) - Financial Information|work= [[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]] |access-date=February 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\n''Wild Card'' has generally received negative reviews from film critics.
