Matty also [[coming out|comes out as gay]] to Em. Matty and Michael make a [[pot brownie]] as a motivational prize for having sex before prom, but Michael feels betrayed when Matty comes out to him. He avoids Matty until Em explains that his friend needs his support, and they go to a [[gay club]] where they unexpectedly meet two of their teachers. Outside the club, a young man named Greg hits Michael's car and they get into a fight.\n\nMichael tries auditioning as a vocalist for Matty's band. At night, the friends go to another gay club where they take [[recreational drugs|drugs]] and dance. Matty stops by Em's house and they have sex. Later, Matty meets Greg and they have fun together. Michael fails to get back together with Ava, and Em drives him to the garage and helps him talk with his mechanic. Later, after giving up on the band, Michael is told by Em that Ava had been cheating on him. They hang out at a construction site and Michael begins to proposition Em when they see Matty [[making out]] with Greg, and all four feel awkward.\n\nMatty and Michael mend their friendship the next day at a go-kart track. Michael tries to proposition Em again but she tells him about the night she and Matty had sex, and he leaves her. Michael gets drunk and outs Matty to his parents, and Matty sends him a hate message. Em criticizes Michael the next day at school. Ostracized, Michael returns to the first gay bar and meets Greg, and they learn that Matty won't talk to either of them.\n\nAt prom, Michael brings Greg as his date while Matty brings Em. Michael gets on stage and sings a song from his and Matty's fourth-grade play, when they became best friends. Michael is accused of being gay and he responds that Greg is a cool guy and that he doesn't care if people call him gay. Michael and Matty apologize to Em and Greg, and go out to the parking lot. Michael was going to get rid of the pot brownie but Matty says that it's beautiful and artistic. They reconcile and, joined by Em and Greg, eat the brownie together. Too high to go back into the prom, they go out to a gay club and dance together, on what Matty declares to be the best day of his life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nicholas Braun]] as Michael, Matty's \"straight friend who goes to great lengths to find him a boyfriend.\"<ref name=\"VareityHunterJoins\">{{cite web |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118040581 |title=Hunter Cope joins Lionsgate's 'Gay Dude' |last=Sneider |first=Jeff |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |date=July 28, 2011 |accessdate=September 30, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203114835/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118040581 |archivedate=February 3, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Hunter Cope as Matty, Michael's gay best friend<ref name=\"VareityOffermanJoins\"/>\n* [[Dakota Johnson]] as Em, Matty's supportive ex-girlfriend<ref name=\"VareityOffermanJoins\"/>\n* [[Nick Offerman]] as Terry, Michael's supportive father<ref name=\"VareityOffermanJoins\"/>\n* [[Gary Cole]] as Dwayne, Matty's conservative father<ref name=\"VareityOffermanJoins\"/>\n* [[Megan Mullally]] as Patricia, Matty's mother<ref name=\"VareityOffermanJoins\"/>\n* [[Sarah Hyland]] as Ava, Michael's girlfriend<ref name=\"VareityHunterJoins\"/>\n* [[Brian Geraghty]] as Lars, Matty's older brother<ref name=\"VareityOffermanJoins\"/>\n* [[Zach Cregger]] as Greg\n* [[Quinn Lord]] as Michael (8 years old)\n* Adam DiMarco as Jared<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.vfs.com/2011/09/15/adam-dimarco-cannot-slow-down/ |title=Adam DiMarco Cannot Slow Down |publisher=[[Vancouver Film School]] |date=September 15, 2011 |accessdate=September 30, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927015305/http://blog.vfs.com/2011/09/15/adam-dimarco-cannot-slow-down/ |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Aziz Ansari]] as Marcus\n* [[Larry Wilmore]] as Mr. Vernon\n\n==Production==\n[[Alan Yang]] started writing the script in 2009, originally titled ''Gay Dude''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kramer |first=Gary M. |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/bent/straight-eye-for-the-queer-guy-on-chris-nelsons-date-and-switch-20140211 |title=Straight Eye For The Queer Guy: On Chris Nelson's \"Date and Switch\" |publisher=[[Indiewire]].
