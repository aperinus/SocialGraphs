The story fictionalizes the true events that surrounded the development of the 1937 musical ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]'' by [[Marc Blitzstein]]; it adapts history to create an account of the original production, bringing in other stories of the time to produce a [[social commentary]] on the role of art and power in the 1930s, particularly amidst the struggles of the [[labor movement]] at the time and the corresponding appeal of [[socialism]] and [[communism]] among many intellectuals, artists and working-class people in the same period.\n\nThe film is not based on Orson Welles's script ''The Cradle Will Rock,'' which was to be an autobiographical account of the play's production. It went into [[pre-production]] in 1983 with [[Rupert Everett]] on board to play Welles before the backers pulled out and the production collapsed.<ref>{{cite book|last=McBride|first=Joseph|title=What Ever Happened to Orson Welles?: A Portrait of an Independent Career|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=2006|page=[https://archive.org/details/whateverhappened00jose/page/223 223]|isbn=0-8131-2410-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/whateverhappened00jose/page/223}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAt the height of the [[Great Depression]], aspiring singer Olive Stanton dreams of getting a job as an actress with the [[Federal Theatre Project]]. Playwright [[Marc Blitzstein]] is working on his new musical, ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]'', but lacks the inspiration to finish it. While attending a public protest, he is visited by two imaginary figures representing his late wife and the famed German playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]]. They encourage him to make the play more relevant to the times rather than an abstract concept.\n\n[[Ventriloquist]] Tommy Crickshaw is assigned the untalented duo Sid and Larry to train. He attempts to initiate a romance with FTP clerk Hazel Huffman. Actor Aldo Silvano moves out of the apartment paid for by his parents because of his family's [[Italian fascism|fascist]] sympathies.\n\nAt the same time, the FTP faces increasing pressure from the federal government, which has begun investigating leftist infiltration of American society through the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]]. Huffman and Crickshaw rehearse her alarmist testimony. The committee accuses FTP director [[Hallie Flanagan]] of propagating [[communism]], making reference to her past claims and the play ''[[Revolt of the Beavers]]''.\n\nHuffman rejects Crickshaw's advances. He oversleeps and wakes up to Sid and Larry doing his routine, with one of them playing the dummy. Depressed, Crickshaw gives a show in which his dummy is a communist. Part of the disgusted audience, Huffman cries and leaves. Crickshaw leaves his dummy on the stage, which is carried off by Sid and Larry. After her testimony, Huffman is shunned by her coworkers.\n\nThe [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]], faced with the threat of losing its budget, cuts funding for all FTP productions, lays off thousands of workers, and orders all ongoing projects, including ''The Cradle Will Rock'', to cease their activities. The actors' union refuses to let them perform without federal approval, cancelling the show's opening.\n\nRather than give in, the show's director, [[Orson Welles]], and producer, [[John Houseman]], set up an improvised performance in a shuttered theater, with Blitzstein as both the cast and the orchestra. As he begins the first song, the other actors suddenly appear in the audience and perform the entire play without setting foot on the stage. A group of workers destroy the mural ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'', following a dispute between [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and [[Diego Rivera]] over the inclusion of Russian communist leader [[Lenin]] in the artwork.\n\nAs the cast and audience break into celebration, a group of former FTP performers stage a mock funeral of Crickshaw's dummy (renamed \"Federal Theatre Project\") down the street outside. The  procession walks into present-day [[Times Square]], which is lined with billboards advertising [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Hank Azaria]] as [[Marc Blitzstein]]\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as [[Harry Hopkins]]\n* [[Jack Black]] as Sid\n* [[Rub\u00e9n Blades]] as [[Diego Rivera]]\n* [[Corina (American singer)|Corina Katt Ayala]] as [[Frida Kahlo]]\n* [[Victoria Clark]] as Dulce Fox\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Hazel Huffman\n* [[John Cusack]] as [[Nelson Rockefeller]]\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as [[John Houseman]]\n* [[Kyle Gass]] as Larry\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Carlo\n* [[Philip Baker Hall]] as Gray Mathers\n* [[Erin Hill]] as Sandra Mescal\n* [[Barnard Hughes]] as Frank Marvel\n* [[Peter Jacobson]] as Silvano\n* [[Cherry Jones]] as [[Hallie Flanagan]]\n* [[Angus Macfadyen]] as [[Orson Welles]]\n* [[Bill Murray]] as  Tommy Crickshaw\n* [[Allan F.

The film takes some narrative license and presents certain events as simultaneous, when they really occurred at different times. Some examples of this are the addition and subsequent destruction of [[Diego Rivera|Rivera]]'s ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'' in the [[GE Building|RCA Building]] (1933\u201334), the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian invasion of Ethiopia]] (1935), [[Memorial Day massacre of 1937|labor strikes against Little Steel]] (1937) and the [[House Un-American Activities Committee#Special Investigation Committee|Dies Committee]]\u2019s assault on the [[Federal Theatre Project]] (1938) (Weales 2000).\n\nIn telling the story of ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]''\u2014a leftist labor musical that was sponsored by the [[Federal Theatre Project]] (FTP) only to be banned after the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] cut the project and diverted its funds elsewhere\u2014Robbins is able to tie in issues such as labor unrest, repression by the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], and the role and value of art in such a tumultuous time.\n\nThe film was released in conjunction with a book that Robbins put together to provide a deeper look into the film's time period. The book includes the film\u2019s script, which is accompanied by essays and pictures describing the people, events, and themes that are the basis for the film.\n\nThe 1937 children's play ''[[Revolt of the Beavers]]'' by playwright/screenwriter [[Oscar Saul]] (who would later do the screenplay for the 1951 film ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'') was also featured in this film. It, too, was under scrutiny from the HUAC for promoting a communistic ideal of equal work and equal rewards. In the film it was valiantly defended by the head of the FTP, [[Hallie Flanagan]] ([[Cherry Jones]]), and the play ran for approximately one month at the Adelphi theater in New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/the-revolt-of-the-beavers-12245|work=[[Internet Broadway Database]]|publisher=[[The Broadway League]]|access-date=May 7, 2018|title=The Revolt of the Beavers}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Cradle Will Rock'' was met with mostly positive reviews.
