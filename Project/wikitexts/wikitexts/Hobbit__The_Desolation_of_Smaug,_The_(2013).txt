Twelve months later, Thorin and his company are being pursued by [[Azog]] and his [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orc]] party. They are ushered along by Gandalf to the nearby home of [[Beorn]], a [[Shapeshifting|skin-changer]] who can take the form of a bear. That night, Azog is summoned to [[Dol Guldur]] by the Necromancer, who commands him to marshal his forces for war. Azog then delegates the hunt for Thorin to his son [[Bolg]]. The following day, Beorn escorts the company to the borders of [[Mirkwood]], where Gandalf discovers [[Black Speech]] imprinted on an old ruin. This, and a prior request by [[Galadriel]], urge him to investigate the tombs of the [[Nazg\u00fbl]]. He warns the company to remain on the path and leaves them.  Upon entering the forest they lose their way and are ensnared by [[Great Spiders of Mirkwood|giant spiders]]. Bilbo then sets about freeing the dwarves with the help of his recently acquired [[One Ring|invisibility ring]]. He subsequently drops the ring and first begins to understand its dark influence after he brutally kills a creature to retrieve it.\n\nThe remaining spiders are fended off by the [[Silvan Elves|Wood-elves]] led by [[Tauriel]] and [[Legolas]]. They also capture the Dwarves and bring Thorin before their king [[Thranduil]]. Thorin confronts the Elvenking about his neglect of the Dwarves of Erebor following [[Smaug]]'s attack 60 years earlier and is consequently imprisoned with the other Dwarves. Bilbo, having avoided capture, arranges an escape using empty wine barrels that are sent downstream. While being pursued by the Wood-elves, they are ambushed by Bolg and his Orc party, and [[K\u00edli]] is wounded with a Morgul shaft. They engage in a running three-way battle down the river, but ultimately the Dwarves are able to escape both groups of pursuers. Thranduil then seals off his kingdom when an Orc captive reveals an evil entity has returned and is amassing an army in the south, but Tauriel decides to leave and assist the Dwarves; Legolas goes after her. Meanwhile, Gandalf and [[Radagast]] go to investigate the tombs of the Nazg\u00fbl, which they find to be empty.\n\nThe company is smuggled into [[Esgaroth]] by a bargeman called [[Bard the Bowman|Bard]]. Thorin promises the Master and the people of Laketown a share of the mountain's treasure. It is then revealed that Bard is a descendant of the last ruler of Dale, and possesses the last black arrow capable of killing Smaug. K\u00edli is forced to remain behind, tended to by [[List of Middle-earth Dwarves#F\u00edli|F\u00edli]], [[List of Middle-earth Dwarves#\u00d3in, son of Gl\u00f3in|\u00d3in]], and [[List of Middle-earth Dwarves#Bofur|Bofur]], as the remaining company receives a grand farewell. Meanwhile, Gandalf travels south to the ruins of Dol Guldur, while Radagast leaves to warn Galadriel of their discovery at the tombs of the Nazg\u00fbl. Gandalf finds the ruins infested with Orcs and is ambushed by Azog. The Necromancer overpowers and defeats Gandalf and reveals himself as [[Sauron]].\n\nThorin and his remaining company reach the [[Lonely Mountain]], where Bilbo discovers the hidden entrance. He is sent in to retrieve the [[Arkenstone]], and while doing so, he accidentally awakens Smaug. While conversing with Bilbo, Smaug reveals his knowledge of both the dwarves' plot to retake the gold and the return of Sauron. Back in Laketown, Bard attempts to bring the black arrow to the town's launcher, as he fears what may happen when the Dwarves enter the mountain. However, he is arrested by the Master and his conniving servant, Alfrid, in the process and leaves his son to hide the arrow. Bolg and his Orc party then infiltrate the town and attack the four Dwarves, but are quickly dispatched following the arrival of Tauriel and Legolas; Tauriel then tends to K\u00edli. While K\u00edli is recovering, he openly admires Tauriel's beauty and wonders if she loves him. Legolas leaves in pursuit of Bolg. Meanwhile, Gandalf watches helplessly as Azog and an Orc army march from Dol Guldur towards the Lonely Mountain.\n\nBack inside the mountain, during a long chase, Bilbo and the Dwarves rekindle the mountain's forge using Smaug's flames to create and melt a large golden statue, hoping to bury Smaug alive in the molten gold. They do so, but Smaug emerges from the gold, stumbles out of the mountain and flies off to destroy Laketown as Bilbo watches in despair.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further-text|[[The Hobbit (film series)#Cast|Cast of The Hobbit film series]]|[[The Hobbit (film series)#Casting|Casting of The Hobbit film series]]}}\n\n<!--PER BILLING POSTER AND PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS.
