One of the guests, Emily, hesitates over whether to accompany her boyfriend Kevin on an extended business trip to [[Vietnam]]. To the party-goers' consternation, their friend Amir brings Laurie, an inappropriately flirtatious woman and Kevin's former girlfriend. During dinner, the conversation becomes strained by the animosity between Emily's close friend Beth and Laurie, compounded when Laurie antagonizes Emily by bringing up a [[ballet]] role she lost by waiting too long to decide.\n\nAs a [[power outage]] occurs, Mike and Lee bring candles and several boxes of different colored [[glow stick]]s to use for light. The friends each take a blue glow stick, then venture outside where they see the comet passing overhead. The entire neighborhood has gone dark except for one house that still has power. When they go back inside, they notice a broken glass no-one remembers damaging. Beth's husband Hugh and Amir decide to go to the lit-up house and ask to use their phone, as Hugh's brother insisted Hugh call him if \"anything strange\" were to happen.\n\nWhen Hugh and Amir return, both have face wounds and are carrying a box which turns out to contain a ping-pong paddle and photographs of everyone, including one of Amir that could only have been taken that night, with numbers written on the backs. Hugh, deeply upset, reveals that he looked into the other house and saw a table set for a dinner party with eight places. The group realize the other house is an [[alternate version]] of the one they are in. Emily writes down the numbers from the box on a notepad, looking for a pattern, but cannot find one.\n\nHugh decides to write a note to leave at the other house, only for a man to approach the house and pin an exact copy of the note to their door before Hugh can go and place it on theirs. Emily, Kevin, Mike, and Laurie decide to go to the other house together, carrying the glow sticks for light. On the way there, they encounter a wandering group of exact doubles of them, carrying red glow sticks rather than blue, causing each group to flee back to their houses.\n\nHugh goes to his car to retrieve a book belonging to his brother, a physicist, containing information about the concept of [[quantum decoherence]]. They deduce that the comet has created two split realities, one of which will collapse once the comet has passed. After Beth is falsely accused of lacing their food with a vial of [[ketamine]] she brought, they surmise that an area of dense darkness outside in the darkened neighborhood will send anyone who passes through it to a different reality's house. They argue about how to deal with the other house and consider stealing the book from the other Hugh's car to prevent their doubles from acquiring the same knowledge. Mike, agitated and starting to drink heavily, expresses a desire to kill their doubles before the doubles can kill them, eventually deciding to blackmail the other house's Mike into staying away from the book via a note.\n\nThe group realizes that Hugh and Amir, in their midst, came from the other house. When the two take the box and leave, they soon return carrying blue glow sticks. They also explain that they found two notes at the other house, leading everyone to realize that the split created [[Multiverse|far more alternate realities]] than they initially thought. Laurie kisses Kevin in the hallway, which Beth witnesses. Hugh's car window outside is smashed by someone from another house. Emily goes to retrieve a ring that Kevin gave her from the glove compartment of her car. Kevin approaches her and they talk, but Emily quickly realizes she is talking to Kevin from a different reality.\n\nShe returns to the others and they decide to create their own unique box in order to make sure they are all from the same reality. They recreate the box of photographs with numbers on the back (taken from die rolls) and include a randomly chosen object. When checking their numbers with the other house's numbers, Emily notices all the numbers differ from the ones she wrote down earlier. After surveying the group, Emily finds that only Lee and Beth, both of whom stayed inside the house the entire time, originate from that house; that herself, Kevin and Laurie are from a different house; that Hugh and Amir are from a third reality after going out to make the phone call; and that Mike is from a fourth house after going out alone to attempt to blackmail himself. The situation deteriorates further when a note meant to blackmail Mike into keeping the others away from the book arrives, revealing an adulterous liaison between him and Beth. Another Mike breaks in and attempts to kill his double, terrifying the group.\n\nEmily leaves the house when Kevin comforts Laurie instead of her. She looks into several alternate houses, finding many where the situation is even worse than the house she came from. She eventually comes across a house in which no one seems aware of the split and where this Emily is happy and secure in her relationship with Kevin after deciding to go to Vietnam with him. Outside, Emily smashes Hugh's car window to lure everyone out of the house, then ambushes this house's Emily and injects her with Beth's ketamine when she goes to get her ring out of her car. Emily takes her former self's place while Miller's Comet breaks apart overhead, but must subdue this house's Emily again when she crawls back into the house's bathroom. She steals the ring from her defeated self after losing her own in the altercation, then faints when returning to the living room.\n\nEmily wakes the following day on the sofa, unable to find her double but with the rest of the party seeming none the wiser. Outside, she and Kevin talk lovingly and he gives her back her ring, which he had found lying on the bathroom floor. Kevin's cell phone rings and he notes that the call is curiously coming from Emily's number. Emily looks mutely down at the two rings she now possesses, and she and Kevin look expressionlessly at one another as he answers the phone.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Emily Baldoni|Emily Foxler]] as Em\n* [[Maury Sterling]] as Kevin\n* [[Nicholas Brendon]] as Mike\n* [[Lorene Scafaria]] as Lee\n* Hugo Armstrong as Hugh\n* [[Elizabeth Gracen]] as Beth\n* Alex Manugian as Amir\n* Lauren Maher as Laurie\n* Aqueela Zoll played one copy of Emily when there were two of them in one scene\n* Kelly Donovan, the real-life identical twin brother of Nicholas Brendon, played one copy of Mike when there were two of them in one scene\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nByrkit came up with the idea for ''Coherence'' after deciding that he wanted to test the idea of shooting a film \"without a crew and without a script\".<ref name=\"Mandatory\">{{cite web |last=Topel |first=Fred |title=Fantastic Fest 2013: James Ward Byrkit & Emily Foxler on Coherence |url=https://www.mandatory.com/fun/576483-fantastic-fest-2013-james-ward-byrkit-emily-foxler-on-coherence |date=September 25, 2013 |publisher=Mandatory |access-date=December 15, 2018}}</ref> He chose to shoot in his own home and developed the film's science fiction aspect out of necessity, as he wanted to \"make a living room feel bigger than just a living room\".<ref name=\"Mandatory\" /> While Byrkit did have a specific idea for how the film would unfold, he selected [[improvisational]] actors and gave them the basic outline of their characters, motivations, and major plot points.<ref>{{cite web |last=Brown |first=Todd |title=COHERENCE: Watch The Theatrical Trailer For James Ward Byrkit's Stellar Indie SciFi |date=May 6, 2014 |url=https://screenanarchy.com/2014/05/coherence-watch-the-theatrical-trailer-for-james-ward-byrkits-stellar-indie-scifi.html |publisher=Screen Anarchy |access-date=December 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nByrkit told an interviewer, \"For about a year, all I did was make charts and maps and drew diagrams of houses, arrows pointing where everyone was going, trying to keep track of different iterations.

The movie's director has said those cuts signify something but hasn't said what they signify. There was no cut to black around 0:16, which was the point of divergence between realities, although the house was plunged into darkness due to an electricity cut. There was no cut to black at 0:17 when the characters all switched from a house without a broken glass to a house with broken glass, and there was no cut to black at 0:46, when only Mike switched to a different reality.\n\n===Casting===\nByrkit intentionally chose actors who did not know each other. He told an interviewer that, after working on blockbuster films (such as ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''), \"I come from the theater where I was trained to really just concentrate on story and character on a stage with actors and so I was craving getting rid of everything, getting rid of the crew; getting rid of the script, no special effects, no support, no money, no nothing, and just getting back to the purity of that, of a camera in your hand and some actress (actors?) that you trust and an idea.\"<ref name=\"NM\">{{cite web |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/moviemom/2014/06/interview-james-ward-byrkit-coherence.html |last=Minow |first=Nell |date=June 18, 2014 |title=Interview: James Ward Byrkit of ''Coherence'' |publisher= BeliefNet |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114114849/http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/moviemom/2014/06/interview-james-ward-byrkit-coherence.html |archive-date=November 14, 2016 |access-date=December 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nByrkit added, {{blockquote|\"...&nbsp;instead of having a script, each actor was given a page of notes each day with their back story or sort of motivation for the night. But they wouldn't know what the other actors had received so it had a very natural, very spontaneous collision of motivations that ended up being what you see on film; obviously guided by a very strict outline that we have been working on for about a year that tracked all the clues and the puzzles and all the rehearsals and things like that. But the actors weren't aware of those, those things happened because we were sort of guiding them through it.\"}}\n\nWhen asked whether the actors were people whom Byrkit knew pretty well, he answered, \"Yeah exactly. They were just friends that I knew I could just call up and say, 'Show up at my house in a couple days. I can't really tell you what we're doing, trust me I'm not going to kill you. It should be fun!'

Just five minutes after they arrived at my house they had to pretend to be married and lovers and best friends.\"<ref name=\"NM\" />\n\nReviewer Matt Prigge praised the choice of casting and their actions: \"Byrkit ... focuses not on brainiacs, as in ''[[Primer (film)|Primer]]'', but on smart but mostly under-informed NPR types, who know enough to slowly piece all this together but not enough that they don't usually descend into blabbering, shouting and drinking. Indeed, ''Coherence'' is largely improvised, with a game cast first believably under-reacting to some weird business with laughter and disbelief, then always maintaining a degree of levity (read: jokes and occasional put-downs) even when stuff has gotten real.\"<ref name=\"MP\">{{cite news |last=Prigge |first=Matt |title=Review: 'Coherence' is a mind-blower that's actually mind-blowing |publisher=[[Metro International]] |date=June 19, 2014 |url= https://www.metro.us/entertainment/review-coherence-is-a-mind-blower-that-s-actually-mind-blowing/tmWnfs---2edeOcxlIPt8Y |access-date= December 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nRyan Lattanzio wrote, \"Byrkit brought eight unwitting actors to his Santa Monica home, threw them a few red herrings and set them loose for five days knowing that the film could evolve organically, like great jazz, if he kept his players in the dark. But he and co-storywriter Alex Manugian weren't just making it up as they went along.\" Byrkit told him that his desire was \"to strip down a film set to the bare minimum: getting rid of the script, getting rid of the crew.\"\n\nByrkit added, \"... instead of a script I had my own 12-page treatment that I spent about a year working on. It outlined all of the twists and reveals, and character arcs and pieces of the puzzle that needed to happen scene-by-scene. But each day, instead of getting a script, the actors would get a page of notes for their individual character, whether it was a backstory or information about their motivations. They would come prepared for their character only. They had no idea what the other characters received, so each night there were completely real reactions, and surprises and responses.

A couple of years ago we were trying to think about what a good low budget, or no budget, movie would be. And, since we didn't have any resources, I had to think of what we actually had.  We had a camera.  We had some actors who were pretty good, and we had a living room. So we had to find out how to make a living room feel like more than just a living room. And, that led to a whole ''Twilight Zone'' type story&nbsp;... I was craving a more naturalistic type of dialogue, where people overlap and it's very messy, where people talk more like real humans talk.

This film explodes with ideas, and it has that thing we always hope for at the movies: the element of surprise.\"<ref name=\"RL\" />\n\nThe reviewer for ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' was ambivalent: \"After the fundamental problem of ''Coherence'' has become clear, or clear-ish \u2013 there's another dinner party, at that other house, that looks an awful lot like this one \u2013 the movie becomes slightly too much like an unfolding mathematical puzzle, although an ingenious one that reaches a chilling conclusion. Notes appear before they are written, the significance of those numbered photographs comes into focus through a series of neat twists, and while the characters are half-aware that their actions are being shaped by a space-time continuum whose cause-and-effect relationship has gone awry, that's not enough to stop them.\"<ref name=\"AO\">{{cite news |url=https://www.salon.com/2014/06/19/coherence_a_strange_sci_fi_riff_on_the_dinner_party_movie/ |last=O'Hehir |first=Andrew |date=June 19, 2014 |title=\"Coherence\" puts a strange, sci-fi twist on the dinner party movie |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |access-date=December 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n* Next Wave Best Screenplay at the [[Austin Fantastic Fest]] (2013, won)<ref name=\"BD\">{{cite web |title='Coherence' Trailer Introduces Psychological Puzzle |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/videos/3292160/coherence-trailer-introduces-psychological-puzzle/ |publisher=Bloody Disgusting |first=Brad |last=Miska |date=May 6, 2014 |access-date=December 15, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Maria Award|Maria Award for Best Screenplay]] at the [[Sitges Film Festival]] (2013, won)<ref name=\"BD\" />\n* Carnet Jove Jury Award for best In Competition at the Sitges Film Festival (2013, won)<ref>{{cite web |title=Sitges - 46ed.
