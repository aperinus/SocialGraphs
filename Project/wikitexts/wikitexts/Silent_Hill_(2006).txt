The film stars [[Radha Mitchell]], [[Sean Bean]], [[Laurie Holden]], [[Deborah Kara Unger]], [[Kim Coates]], [[Tanya Allen]], [[Alice Krige]], and [[Jodelle Ferland]]. The film follows Rose, who takes her adopted daughter, Sharon, to the town of Silent Hill, for which Sharon cries while [[sleepwalking]]. Rose is involved in a car accident near the town and awakens to find Sharon missing. While searching for her daughter, she fights a local cult and begins to uncover Sharon's connection to the town's dark past.\n\nAfter attempting to gain the film rights to ''Silent Hill'' for five years, Gans sent a video interview to Konami explaining his plans for adapting it and how important the games were to him. Konami awarded him the film rights as a result, and he and Avary began working on the script in 2004. Avary used [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]] as an inspiration for the town. [[Principal photography]] began in April 2005 and lasted three months with an estimated $50 million budget, and was shot on sound sets and on location in [[Ontario, Canada]]. Most of the monsters encountered in the film were played by professional dancers, while a minority were created with [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]].\n\n''Silent Hill'' was released theatrically in Canada on April 21, 2006, by [[Alliance Atlantis]]; in France on April 26, by [[Metropolitan Filmexport]]; and in Japan on July 8, by [[Shochiku]]. The film grossed $100.6 million worldwide. It received generally negative reviews from critics, although receiving better contemporary reviews and gaining a cult status in the video game adaptations.{{Not verified in body|date=October 2022}}<ref>{{Cite web |last=Goslin |first=Austen |date=2022-10-18 |title=The Silent Hill movie is secretly great |url=https://www.polygon.com/23411610/silent-hill-movie-new-game-announcement |access-date=2022-10-27 |website=Polygon |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Caicoya |first=Bea |date=2019-11-16 |title=Is the First Silent Hill Movie Actually...

Desperate for a solution, Rose takes Sharon on a trip to Silent Hill to find answers. Her erratic behavior concerns police officer [[Cybil Bennett]] when they encounter her at a gas station en route. As they enter Silent Hill, a girl steps out into the road, causing Rose to crash and blackout. She awakens in the fog-shrouded dimension of Silent Hill, and realizes that Sharon is missing.\n\nSearching the town for Sharon, Rose pursues the girl she encountered prior to the crash, who resembles Sharon. At various points, the town suddenly transitions into a nightmarish world inhabited by inhuman monsters, including the fearsome [[Pyramid Head]]. Cybil encounters and tries to arrest Rose, but while attempting to bring her to the local station, they realize they are trapped, all roads out of town ending in a mysterious cliff. Rose encounters many other inhuman creatures and learns of [[Alessa Gillespie]], a young girl burned as a witch by the Brethren, the town's fanatical [[Manichean]] cult. Her mother [[List of Silent Hill series characters#Dahlia Gillespie|Dahlia]] wanders the streets as an outcast, guilt-ridden over her negligence that led to Alessa's suffering. In the real world, Christopher searches the abandoned town with policeman Thomas Gucci, but they find nothing: the town appears to them simply as a dilapidated, abandoned place devoid of fog or creatures. Gucci later reveals he lived in Silent Hill and saved Alessa from the fire. He encourages Christopher to end his futile search.\n\nIn the Silent Hill dimension, Rose encounters the girl again, revealed to be an aspect of Alessa. When the town transitions into the dark dimension, Rose, Cybil, and Anna, a Brethren member, flee to an old church, but Pyramid Head catches and flays Anna alive. Brethren members lead Rose and Cybil to a hospital, claiming the demon that has taken Sharon is in the basement. Upon noticing an image of Sharon in Rose's locket, Christabella, the [[high priest]]ess of the Brethren, identifies Sharon as a likeness of Alessa. She decries the two women as witches and orders her Brethren to stop them. Cybil holds them off while Rose descends into the basement, but is quickly subdued and captured.\n\nRose explores the basement but is barricaded by a group of disfigured nurses. She sneaks past them and enters Alessa's room. In a flashback, it is revealed that Alessa was stigmatized by the townspeople for being [[Legitimacy (family law)|born out of wedlock]]. Christabella convinced Dahlia to \"purify\" Alessa after Alessa was raped by the school janitor. Christabella [[Death by burning|immolated]] Alessa during a ritual in 1974, but Dahlia alerted Gucci. The pair arrived too late and the ritual went awry, igniting the coal seam fire. Hospitalized and in excruciating pain, Alessa's rage split her soul apart, one half manifesting as the dark entity responsible for the shifting dimensions of Silent Hill. Her remaining innocence manifested as Sharon, who was taken to the real world to be adopted. Desperate to find Sharon, Rose allows Dark Alessa's spirit into her body, allowing it access to the church. Sharon, despite being protected by Dahlia, is captured by the Brethren.\n\nIn the church, Christabella burns Cybil as a witch and plans to do the same to Sharon. Rose confronts Christabella, denouncing her as a murderer before Christabella stabs Rose in the heart. Alessa emerges from the blood flowing from the wound as a disfigured being bound to a hospital bed, and tears Christabella and her followers apart with razor wire. Rose rescues Sharon, and Sharon and Alessa/Dark Alessa reunite into one body. Rose and Alessa leave the town and return home. Upon arriving, they discover they are still in the foggy dimension, separated from reality. Meanwhile, Christopher awakens alone in the real world and discovers that the front door has mysteriously opened.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Radha Mitchell]] as Rose Da Silva, the desperate mother who seeks a cure for her daughter Sharon's nightmarish sleepwalking by taking her to the town of Silent Hill.\n* [[Sean Bean]] as Christopher Da Silva, the father of Sharon and husband of Rose who opposes his wife's decision to find answers in Silent Hill.\n* [[Laurie Holden]] as [[List of Silent Hill series characters#Cybil Bennett|Cybil Bennett]], the motorcycle police officer from the city of Brahams who becomes suspicious of Rose and follows her into Silent Hill.\n* [[Jodelle Ferland]] as [[List of Silent Hill series characters#Alessa Gillespie|Alessa Gillespie]], a powerful psychic born out of wedlock, who is persecuted and eventually immolated by the Brethren.

He compared it to the [[Orpheus and Eurydice|myth of Orpheus]], who descended into the underworld after [[Eurydice]]. However, he said that ''Silent Hill 2'' was not the \"real ''Silent Hill''\": there was no mythology, and the city only played the role of a backdrop for the unfolding story.

Many of his entourage were surprised at the opinion that a banal video game can scare someone. To this, the director replied that ''Silent Hill'' was one of the scariest experiences he ever had. He called it \"an experiment with a unique and independent world, which is both beautiful and terrible at the same time\".<ref name=\"PotDMoSH\" /> Even before the release of ''Silent Hill 2'', Gans sent \"a ton of letters\" to copyright holders, but received no response. He presented his vision of the film and how important the games are to him in a 37-minute video with Japanese subtitles, which was shown at a meeting of the [[Konami]] board of directors.

Sean Bean also found the plot scary. In contrast to these impressions, [[Laurie Holden]] liked the script \u2014 she deemed it spectacular, complex, multi-level with wonderful themes and therefore interesting to work with.

Silent Hill exists simultaneously in four different variations: the city of the [[1970s]], Silent Hill in the present, Silent Hill in the fog, and Silent Hill in the darkness. Two of the above measurements are based on temporal changes \u2014 one represents the city of thirty years ago and is used only in flashbacks, the other displays the current state of the city to which Christopher goes in search of his wife and daughter. The two remaining dimensions include a foggy day in which Rose searches for her daughter, symbolizing [[purgatory]], and a gloomy day, consisting of enveloping darkness, which is the embodiment of [[Hell]]. Gans reported that in his work he tried to discover new dimensions of space and time in [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[mystical]] aspects.<ref name=\"pronot\" /><ref name=\"si\" /><ref name=\"chist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/03/10/silent-hill-director-interview-exclusive-image?page=3|title=Silent Hill: Director Interview & Exclusive Image (page 3)|author=Jeff Otto.|date=2006-03-10|publisher=[[IGN]]|access-date=2012-09-24|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530163723/http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/03/10/silent-hill-director-interview-exclusive-image?page=3|archive-date=2015-05-30|url-status=live}}</ref> He stated, \"We're not trying to explain everything, as I prefer people to find meaning in this story themselves.

The film talks about people who deny their own fate and therefore fall into the trap of [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate dimensions]]. It \"deals with the terror of loneliness, the fear of the dark, the fear of taking responsibility for your own evil side, and the fear of your own fate\". The game created a sense of constant threat, while the film \"seeks to reproduce that experience for a wider audience\".<ref name=\"pronot\" />\n\nThe film's [[leitmotif]] is motherhood, faith and persecution, presented at a symbolic level. Motherhood represents a form of the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]]. In addition to Rose, the key characters in the themes of the [[dramatic structure]] are the childless Cybil, Dahlia, and Christabella; the latter of whom lost her child, believing that abandoning motherhood is a blessing for society. Gans stated that motherhood in the film is about \"[[Immaculate Conception]] \u2014 motherhood achieved in the noblest way.\" By the time ''Silent Hill'' comes to its denouement, which takes place in the sanctuary of the sect, the film turns into a cautionary tale warning against [[religious fanaticism]]. The director noted that [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religions constantly attacked the idea of femininity, but the film, at the same time, is not moralizing.<ref name=\"pronot\" /><ref name=\"ofsag\">{{cite web|url=http://www.silenthillmovie.ru/|title=\u041e \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0435. \u0410\u0434\u0430\u043f\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b|work=\u041e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0430|publisher=Silenthillmovie.ru|access-date=2012-08-05|language=ru}}</ref>\n\nGans described the concept of the town's connection to the child Alessa and the cult: \"It's a town of people trapped in dark dreams, and she inflicts onto the town what those people did to her body.

Gans believed that the film crew was able to create a unique piece that did not rely on the style of Lyne's film.
