(also known as '''''They Call Me Bruce''''') is a 1982 American [[action comedy film]] directed by [[Elliott Hong]], written by David B. Randolph and starring [[Johnny Yune]] and [[Margaux Hemingway]].<ref>{{cite web|title=KOREAN COMIC IN 'THEY CALL ME BRUCE'|author=F. Shepard, Richard|date=January 16, 1983|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C03E7D9103BF935A25752C0A965948260|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\nThe film was followed by a sequel, ''[[They Still Call Me Bruce]]'' (1987), which also starred Johnny Yune.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with a young boy running to meet his grandfather (played by Yune), who lies dying on his bed. The young boy sadly explains that he could not find the medicine required to cure his grandfather's ailment and wonders aloud who will take care of him after his grandfather dies. His dying grandfather attempts to reassure the young boy and explains that he should go to [[United States|America]]. He further explains that when he was younger and working as a [[merchant marine]], he met \"the most beautiful girl\" in America and tells the young boy that if he goes there, she will take very good care of him. As the young boy is asking how to find her, his grandfather dies and the film fades to black.\n\nWhen it fades back in, quite some time has passed and the young boy, who is now an adult, has arrived in America and has begun working as a chef, catering to some gangsters in California. The gangsters, who call the man \"Bruce\" due to his resemblance to the famed [[Martial arts|martial artist]] [[Bruce Lee]], are having trouble keeping their \"boss of bosses\" happy and are trying to come up with the perfect solution to distributing cocaine to all of their clients throughout the United States. Some previous attempts at moving the drug have resulted in busts and the boss of bosses is not happy.\n\nThrough a series of misunderstandings, Bruce makes it into the local newspaper as a hero, having thwarted an attempted robbery at the local market. Bruce's boss, Lil' Pete, sees the newspaper and quickly devises a plan, putting Bruce in control of moving the cocaine across the country and using Freddy, a stooge associated with the drug lords, as Bruce's [[limousine]] [[chauffeur]]. He convinces Bruce (who already wants to go to New York City to find the lady of whom his grandfather spoke) that he should drive to New York, not fly, as flying would rob him of seeing the beautiful countryside. Bruce agrees, and the rest of the film follows an unknowing Bruce delivering what he thinks to be Chinese [[flour]] to associates of the gangsters across the country, and the interactions he has with the people on this trip.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"\n!

Various scenes were cut to adhere to the standards of a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG]] rating, one of which was the removal of a short scene of [[nudity]] involving a woman disrobing while Bruce is in a [[hot tub]].\n\nA 25th-Anniversary DVD edition of ''They Call Me Bruce?'' was released on June 30, 2009, by Liberation Entertainment. The film is a high-quality transfer from a newly discovered 35&nbsp;mm print, which the studio calls \"pristine\", and also restores the scenes that were cut from the original DVD release.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0084786}}\n*{{rotten tomatoes|they_call_me_bruce}}\n\n[[Category:1982 films]]\n[[Category:1982 martial arts films]]\n[[Category:1980s action comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s parody films]]\n[[Category:American action comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films set in California]]\n[[Category:Films about immigration to the United States]]\n[[Category:Immigration in fiction]]\n[[Category:Chinese-American films]]\n[[Category:Korean-American films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Bruce Lee]]\n[[Category:Asian-American action films]]\n[[Category:1982 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
