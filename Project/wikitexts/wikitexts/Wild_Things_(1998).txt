It follows a high-school guidance counselor in south [[Florida]] who is accused of rape by two female students, and a series of subsequent revelations after a police officer begins investigating the alleged crimes.\n\n''Wild Things'' was followed by three [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] sequels: ''[[Wild Things 2]]'' (2004), ''[[Wild Things: Diamonds in the Rough]]'' (2005) and ''[[Wild Things: Foursome]]'' (2010).\n\n==Plot==\nIn the upscale [[Miami]] suburb of Blue Bay,  wealthy Kelly Van Ryan accuses her high school guidance counselor, Sam Lombardo, of [[rape|raping]] her. Following the accusation, her outcast classmate Suzie Toller, who comes from a poor family in the [[Everglades]], makes a similar accusation. Sam hires attorney Kenneth Bowden to defend him. At trial, Suzie succumbs to pressure during [[cross-examination]], and admits that she and Kelly concocted the false allegations to get revenge on Sam: Suzie for his failure to bail her out of jail on a minor drug charge, and Kelly for his affair with her mother, wealthy heiress Sandra Van Ryan. Sam and Kenneth negotiate an $8.5 million settlement for [[defamation]], which Sandra pays out using funds from a [[Trust law|trust]] Kelly would receive only upon Sandra's death. After the payout, it is revealed that Sam and the two girls were accomplices who used the trial to extort money from Sandra.\n\nPolice detective Ray Duquette suspects the trio are working a scam. Against the wishes of the district attorney's office, he continues investigating Sam. He tells Kelly and Suzie that Sam has already transferred the money to an off-shore account. Suzie panics and goes to Kelly, who comforts her. Kelly, however, calls Sam and tells him they may have to get rid of Suzie. In the pool, Suzie attacks Kelly. They fight, but eventually end up kissing, while watched by Ray, unbeknownst to them. A few nights later, at the beach, Sam apparently bludgeons Suzie to death while Kelly waits nearby. The two then drive to the swamp where Sam disposes of the plastic-wrapped body.\n\nRay and his partner, Detective Gloria Perez, investigate Suzie's disappearance. Her blood and teeth are found at the beach, while her abandoned car is found at a bus terminal. The D.A.'s office again insists that Ray drops the case, but he asks Gloria to watch Sam. Sam shows Gloria Kelly's school files, which suggest she is  troubled and violent. Meanwhile, Ray goes to Kelly's house to confront a scared and upset Kelly. Ray enters the guest house where Kelly is staying, and gunfire erupts. Sandra rushes in as Ray stumbles out of the house; he has suffered a gunshot wound to the shoulder, while Sandra discovers Kelly dead from two gunshots to the chest. Ray claims Kelly fired the gun first, and that he killed her in self-defense. No charges are filed against him, but he is dismissed from the force for disobeying orders.\n\nIt is revealed that Sam is in cahoots with Ray. Although Sam is displeased Ray killed Kelly instead of just framing her for Suzie's murder, he agrees they have fewer loose ends. The two go sailing on Sam's sailboat, where Sam attempts to kill Ray. When Ray fights back, he is shot and killed with a [[speargun]] by Suzie, who is in fact alive, having staged her murder with Sam. Suzie reveals she was motivated to kill Ray to avenge the murder of her best friend, Davey, whom Ray wrongly shot to death and framed as a self-defense killing. Sam reluctantly accepts a drink from Suzie, who assures him she would not double-cross him; however, upon drinking it, he realizes she has poisoned it before Suzie knocks him overboard and sails into the sunset.\n\nSeveral [[mid-credits scene]]s reveal that Suzie was the ultimate mastermind of the plot: Upon finding that Sam and Kelly were having a sexual relationship, Suzie [[blackmail]]ed Sam with photographs of them having sex, convincing him to help with her scheme. Suzie subsequently orchestrated the meeting between Sam and Ray at a local bar. Later, during her staged murder on the beach, Suzie pulled out her own teeth with pliers to make her death appear legitimate. Finally, with Kelly, Ray, and Sam all dead, Suzie is met by Kenneth, who bestows her a briefcase full of cash that he describes as \"just walking around money\" and a check for millions of dollars; as she leaves, he tells her to \"be good.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n<!-- The following are listed in the order of the opening credits. -->\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Sergeant Ray Duquette \n* [[Matt Dillon]] as Sam Lombardo\n* [[Neve Campbell]] as Suzie Toller\n* [[Theresa Russell]] as Sandra Van Ryan\n* [[Denise Richards]] as Kelly Lanier Van Ryan\n* [[Daphne Rubin-Vega]] as Detective Gloria Perez \n* [[Carrie Snodgress]] as Ruby\n* [[Jeff Perry (American actor)|Jeff Perry]] as Bryce Hunter\n* [[Robert Wagner]] as Tom Baxter\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Kenneth Bowden\n* Dennis Neal as Art Maddox\n* [[Marc Macaulay]] as Walter\n* Cory Pendergast as Jimmy Leach\n* Toi Svane Stepp as Nicole\n* Paulo Benedeti as Kirk\n* [[Eduardo Y\u00e1\u00f1ez]] as Frankie Condo\n* [[Jennifer Taylor (actress)|Jennifer Taylor]] as Barbara Baxter\n}}\n\n==Analysis and themes==\nLiterary scholar John Thorburn notes that ''Wild Things'' is loosely based on several figures in Greek tragedies, namely [[Medea]], whom he describes the character of Suzie as a \"modern-day version of.\"{{sfn|Thorburn|2010|p=113}} He also notes that Kelly functions as a [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]]-like figure, while Sam exemplifies both [[Jason]] and [[Hippolytus of Athens|Hippolytus]].{{sfn|Thorburn|2010|pages=113\u2013114}} Thorburn suggests that the film's \"most under-appreciated element is screenwriter Stephen Peters\u2019s obvious debt to classical mythology, tragedy and, especially, two [[Euripides|Euripidean]] plays, ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'' (431 BC) and ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'' (428 BC).{{sfn|Thorburn|2010|p=114}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{quotebox|width=28%|bgcolor=light-grey|quote=\"I was at a point in my career where I needed to do a commercial picture, and that was one of the key reasons I chose the film.

But this was one of those rare films whose underlying smarts couldn't be denied.\"<ref name=revisiting/>\n\nMcNaughton commented in 2018 that he considered ''Wild Things'' his \"most political film\" due to its focus on [[social class]], concluding: \"Who wins? The girl from the [[trailer park]]! She\u2019s all alone on the ninety foot sail boat, out on the Caribbean. Pretty much everyone else is dead. That was the nineties, with the concentration of wealth. But the girl from the trailer park takes \u2018em all down. You know, I\u2019m from the striving working class. A lot of the kids I grew up with, the parents didn\u2019t care if their kid dropped out of school. But some of us had parents who insisted their children have an education, go to college, escape all that. So that\u2019s where my heart always lies.\"<ref name=flashback>{{cite magazine|magazine=The Flashback Files|url=https://www.flashbackfiles.com/john-mcnaughton-interview|title=How Dare You?
