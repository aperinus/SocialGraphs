It was directed by [[Heitor Dhalia]], and stars [[Selton Mello]]. The film was produced by Gera\u00e7\u00e3o Conte\u00fado, [[Primo Filmes]] & RT Features.\n\n== Plot ==\nLouren\u00e7o is a lonely pawn shop owner whose work made him insensitive to the suffering of those who desperately seek to sell him their personal possessions. Louren\u00e7o's insensitivity causes him to deal with the world as a collection of objects to be bought. He begins to play power games with his customers and derives pleasure from it. \n\nLouren\u00e7o narrates the movie, and throughout the plot, he reveals his growing lust for power. The literal name of the movie (\"The Smell from the Drain\") refers to the persistent bad odor that comes from the restroom in Louren\u00e7o's office. Louren\u00e7o's lust for power is symbolized by this very scent. He slowly comes to realize that the stench from the drain actually comes from him. \n\nLouren\u00e7o's life changes when he becomes infatuated with a local waitress, whose physical attributes become yet another object to him, and as with any other object, he desires to possess her. In the end, destruction prevails.\n\n== Festival career ==\n\n*'''[[Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival]]'''\n**Best Latin American Film ([[FEPRASCI]] award)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fipresci.org/festival-reports/2006/rio-de-janeiro|title=FIPRESCI - Rio de Janeiro|website=www.fipresci.org|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref>\n**Special Jury Award\n**Best Actor ([[Selton Mello]])\n*'''Mostra BR - [[S\u00e3o Paulo International Film Festival]]'''\n**Best Film (Bandeira Paulista Award)\n**Critic Award\n**Special Mention to the Film's Cast\n*International Competition at the [[2007 Sundance Film Festival]]<ref name=variety>[https://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&jump=review&id=2471&reviewid=VE1117932477&cs=1] Robert Koehler.
