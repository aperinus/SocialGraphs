The satirical dynamics of a [[Minnesota]] town unfold as multiple contestants in the regional American Teen Princess Pageant begin to die suspiciously.\n\nThe film has gained new fans with time and is now regarded as a [[cult film]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1995, Mount Rose, [[Minnesota]] is preparing for the annual Sarah Rose Cosmetics Mount Rose American Teen Princess Pageant [[beauty pageant]]. Ambitious Amber Atkins, an optimist, signs up to follow in the footsteps of her idol [[Diane Sawyer]].\n\nHer mother, Annette is a former contestant. Amber works after school in the mortuary, applying makeup to corpses. They live in a small trailer near their friend Loretta.\n\nFellow contestant Rebecca (\"Becky\") Leeman is the daughter of the richest man in town. His wife, Gladys Leeman is the head of the pageant organizing committee and former winner. Business connections between their furniture store and the pageant judges cause many to fear the contest will be rigged.\n\nIn the days leading up to the pageant, many odd events occur around town, including: contestant Tammy Curry (president of the gun club), who is killed when her tractor explodes; and then the death of a boy Becky liked, but interested in Amber, ruled a hunting accident.\n\nAmber decides to pull out after receiving a threatening note and her mother is injured in an explosion at their [[mobile home]], but reconsiders to make her mother proud. At the dress rehearsal, fellow contestant Jenelle Betz swaps numbers with Amber. Midway through Janelle's rehearsal performance, a stage light knocks her unconscious and renders her [[deaf]]. Luckily, Jenelle knows [[American sign language]] so she claims that despite dropping out of the pageant, she has never been happier.\n\nAt the pageant, Amber's dance costume disappears. She blames Becky and they have a catfight. Pageant choreographer Chloris Klinghagen gives Amber a new costume, however Iris and Gladys say she can't perform as the new costume was not approved weeks ago. When Lisa finds Amber crying, she drops out to give her approved costume. Amber gets a standing ovation for her [[tap dance]] number.\n\nBecky sings a cringe-worthy song, dancing with a life-size Jesus doll on a crucifix, both amusing and horrifying the audience. The winners are announced, cheerleader Leslie Miller is second runner-up, Amber is first runner-up, with Becky winning.\n\nDuring Becky's victory parade the next day, she is killed in a freak accident when her elaborate [[swan]] float (her father had it made in [[Mexico]], to save money) bursts into flames and explodes. A grief-stricken Gladys flies into a blind rage,  admitting to being responsible for all the shenanigans, and is immediately arrested. Amber becomes the new pageant winner.\n\nAt the State Competition, Amber wins the Minnesota title by default after the other contestants get [[food poisoning]]. she gets an all-expenses-paid trip to the national Pageant. Upon arrival, Amber and the other state winners are devastated to find that the cosmetics company was shut down for [[tax evasion]]. This sends all the contestants except Amber on a rampage, vandalizing the property.\n\nA few years later, Gladys escapes from prison and is sniping from the top of the Mount Rose supermarket, declaring her intent to take revenge on Amber. During the six-hour police standoff, a television reporter at the scene is hit by a stray bullet. Amber quickly picks up the microphone, taking over reporting the story, impressing the news station with her poise and confidence.\n\nAmber becomes co-anchor of the evening news for [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul]] WAZB-TV, thus fulfilling her dream of possibly becoming the next Diane Sawyer.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Amber Atkins\n* [[Ellen Barkin]] as Annette Atkins\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Loretta\n* [[Denise Richards]] as Rebecca Ann \"Becky\" Leeman\n* [[Kirstie Alley]] as Gladys Leeman\n* [[Sam McMurray]] as Lester Leeman\n* [[Mindy Sterling]] as Iris Clark\n* [[Brittany Murphy]] as Lisa Swenson\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Leslie Miller\n* Laurie Sinclair as Michelle Johnson\n* Shannon Nelson as Tess Weinhaus\n* Tara Redepenning as Molly Howard\n* Sarah Stewart as Jenelle Betz\n* [[Alexandra Holden]] as Mary Johanson\n* Brooke Elise Bushman as Tammy Curry\n* [[Matt Malloy]] as John Dough, Judge #1\n* [[Mike McShane]] as Harold Vilmes, Judge #2\n* [[Will Sasso]] as Hank Vilmes\n* [[Lona Williams]] as Jean Kangas, Judge #3\n* John T.

The town is based on [[Rosemount, Minnesota|Rosemount]], where the writer, [[Lona Williams]], grew up. The film was originally titled \"Dairy Queens\" but was changed for legal reasons.<ref name=\"buzzfeed-15\">{{cite web | date = July 22, 2014 | first = Louis | last = Peitzman | title = \"Jesus Loves Winners\": How \"Drop Dead Gorgeous\" Found Cult Success As A Flop |url= https://www.buzzfeed.com/louispeitzman/drop-dead-gorgeous-15-year-anniversary |website= [[BuzzFeed]] }}</ref>\n\nThe characters in the movie all sport exaggerated, over the top parodies of [[North Central American English|Minnesota accent]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.uta.fi/FAST/US1/REF/dial-map.html |title= FAST-US-1 Intro to American English Reference File |publisher= Uta.fi |access-date= 2012-02-14 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120212114007/http://www.uta.fi/FAST/US1/REF/dial-map.html |archive-date=2012-02-12 }}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot throughout the [[Carver County, Minnesota|Carver County]] area, mainly in [[Waconia, Minnesota]], although names of real Minnesota communities were shown on the sashes of contestants later in the movie.\n\nNews reporter [[Diane Sawyer]] is mentioned throughout the film as Kirsten Dunst's character Amber Atkins's [[Cult image|idol]] as Sawyer was a former beauty pageant winner. Amber's other idols include her beauty pageant mother who raised her alone in a trailer park and the previous year's winner who is hospitalized for [[anorexia]]. Competing in the beauty pageant for a scholarship is juxtaposed against the opportunities that boys have in leaving \"Mount Rose\" such as [[Ice hockey|hockey]] scholarships and [[prison]].\n\nTwo [[Melissa Manchester]] songs are featured in the film as songs used in the talent portion by contestants. Mary lip-syncs \"Don't Cry Out Loud\", while Jenelle sings and signs \"Through the Eyes of Love\". [[Fanfare for the Common Man]] is played to introduce the parade for the rigged competition and the plight of Hank. \"Are we on ''[[Cops (TV series)|Cops]]'' again?\" is used throughout the movie when the \"mockumentary\" film crew is spotted. Richard Strauss' \"Also Sprach Zarathustra\", inspired by Friedrich Nietzsche, is played when the Minnesota state pageant is interrupted by the violent illness of the contestants who ate shellfish (all except Amber).\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mixed reviews. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 47% based on 74 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"Its dark humor sometimes hits, but mostly misses the target.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/drop_dead_gorgeous/ |title= Drop Dead Gorgeous |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref> [[Metacritic]] gives the film a score of 28% based on reviews from 28 critics, indicating generally unfavorable reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.metacritic.com/movie/drop-dead-gorgeous |title= Drop Dead Gorgeous |website= [[Metacritic]] }}</ref> Audiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade \"C\u2212\" on scale of A to F.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= Cinemascore |url-status = dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= 2018-12-20 }}</ref>\n\nMany critics liked the modern interpretation of the pageant world although just as many people disliked the film as a whole.
