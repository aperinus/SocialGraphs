It depicts the early life of the British author [[Jane Austen]] and her lasting love for [[Thomas Langlois Lefroy]]. American actress [[Anne Hathaway]] stars as the title character, while her romantic interest is played by Scottish actor [[James McAvoy]]. Also appearing in the film are [[Julie Walters]], [[James Cromwell]] and [[Maggie Smith]]. This was [[Ian Richardson]]'s final film performance before his death in the same year as the film's release. The film was produced in cooperation with several companies, including [[Ecosse Films]] and [[Graham Broadbent#Career|Blueprint Pictures]]. It also received funding from the [[Irish Film Board]] and the [[UK Film Council]] Premiere Fund.\n\nThe film is partly based on the 2003 book ''[[Becoming Jane Austen]]'' by [[Jon Hunter Spence]], who was also hired as historical consultant. The final screenplay, developed by [[Sarah Williams (screenwriter)|Sarah Williams]] and [[Kevin Hood]], pieced together some known facts about Austen into a coherent story, in what co-producer [[Graham Broadbent]] called \"our own Austenesque landscape.\" According to Hood, he attempted to weave together \"what we know about Austen's world from her books and letters,\" and believed Austen's personal life was the inspiration for ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''.<ref name=writingstudio/> Jarrold began production of the film in early 2006, opting to shoot primarily in Ireland as he found it had better-preserved locations than [[Hampshire]], England, where Austen was raised.\n\nReleased firstly in the United Kingdom on 9 March 2007 and in other countries later in the year, ''Becoming Jane'' earned approximately $37 million worldwide. The film received mixed reviews from critics. Hathaway's performance received mixed critical reception, with some reviewers negatively focusing on her nationality and accent. Commentators and scholars have analysed the presence of Austen characters and themes within the film, and also noted the implementation of [[mass marketing]] in the film's release.\n\n==Plot==\nJane Austen is a younger daughter of the Reverend George Austen and his wife, who have yet to find a suitable husband for Jane. She aspires to be a writer, to the dismay of her mother and proud delight of her father.\n\nThomas Lefroy is a promising lawyer with a bad reputation, which he describes as \"typical\" for people in the profession, and is sent to live in the country by his uncle to calm him down. There he makes a terrible first impression upon meeting Jane, when he nearly falls asleep while she gives a reading of her work. Overhearing his subsequent criticism, Jane cannot stand the arrogant Irishman. Meanwhile, she turns down the affections of other men, including Mr. Wisley, the nephew and heir of the wealthy Lady Gresham. Wisley proposes but Jane ultimately rejects him due to her lack of affection for him. The mischievous Tom encounters Jane again; they argue but increasingly take interest in each other and Tom demonstrates that he takes Jane's literary aspirations seriously. In time they fall in love.\n\nTom, Jane, her brother Henry and Jane's rich widowed cousin, Eliza, Comtesse de Feullide, conspire to receive an invitation from Tom's uncle and benefactor, the Lord Chief Judge Langlois, for the rich \"Madame La Comtesse\" and her friends. This visit to London is meant to be a short break in their journey to see Jane's brother, Edward, and would allow Judge Langlois to get to know Jane and give a blessing for their marriage.\n\nFull of hope, Jane cannot sleep during the night at the Judge's place. In a flow of inspiration, she then begins the writing of ''First Impressions'', the manuscript that will become ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''. However, Judge Langlois receives a letter informing him of the genteel poverty of Jane's family and he refuses to give Tom his blessing, declaring that he would wish Tom to be the whoremonger he had been rather than allow him to live in poverty because of a bad marriage. Tom tells Jane that he cannot marry her and she is crushed, not knowing that Tom has a legitimate reason; his family depends on him financially.\n\nJane returns home and soon learns that Tom has become engaged to someone else at the arrangement of his family. Cassandra learns that her fianc\u00e9, Robert Fowle, has died of Yellow Fever while stationed abroad. Then Jane accepts the marriage proposal of Mr. Wisley, who had not lost hope that she would change her mind. Later, Tom realises he cannot live without Jane and returns, asking Jane to run away with him, for \"what value will there be in life, if we are not together?\" Jane agrees, and they leave, with only Jane's sister Cassandra knowing they plan to marry in secret.\n\nOn the way, Jane stumbles upon a letter from Tom's mother, and realises his situation: he sends money he receives from his uncle back to his parents and siblings, and his family cannot survive without it. She tells Tom that they cannot elope, not with so many people depending upon him. He insists that he and Jane must marry and tells her he will earn money, but Jane tells him that it will not be enough; he will never be able to make enough money to support his dependants with a High Court judge (his uncle) as an enemy and with a penniless wife. Distraught, Tom asks her if she loves him, and she replies, \"Yes, but if our love destroys your family, then it will destroy itself, in a long, slow degradation of guilt and regret and blame.\"\n\nJane returns home and receives a proposal from John Warren. She declines, and suddenly accuses him of being the one who wrote to the Judge and denied her chances of happiness. Lady Gresham informs Jane that Mr. Wisley is withdrawing his proposal, but Wisley and Jane talk afterwards and part as friends.\n\nTwenty years later, Jane, now a successful author and by choice unmarried, sees Tom during a gathering. Henry, now married to Eliza, brings Tom to her. Tom introduces his eldest daughter, who admires Jane's novels. Tom's daughter asks Jane to read aloud, but as Jane rarely does so Tom remonstrates with his daughter calling her by name - which is also Jane. Astonished that he named his eldest after her, Jane agrees to her request. The last scene shows Tom's daughter sitting by Jane as she reads aloud from ''Pride and Prejudice'', while Tom watches Jane affectionately. As she concludes, their eyes meet and Tom joins the rest of the company in honouring Jane and her work with applause.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as [[Jane Austen]]\n* [[James McAvoy]] as [[Thomas Langlois Lefroy|Thomas \"Tom\" Lefroy]]\n* [[Julie Walters]] as Mrs. Austen\n* [[James Cromwell]] as Reverend George Austen\n* [[Maggie Smith]] as Lady Gresham\n* [[Lucy Cohu]] as [[Eliza de Feuillide|Eliza, Comtesse de Feuillide]]\n* [[Laurence Fox]] as Mr. Wisley\n* [[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]] as [[Henry Thomas Austen|Henry Austen]]\n* [[Ian Richardson]] as Lord Chief Judge Langlois of London\n* [[Sophie Vavasseur|Sophie Vavassuer]] as Jane Lefroy\n* [[Anna Maxwell Martin]] as [[Cassandra Austen]]\n* [[Leo Bill]] as John Warren\n* Jessica Ashworth as Lucy Lefroy\n* Eleanor Methven as Mrs Lefroy\n* [[Helen McCrory]] as [[Ann Radcliffe|Mrs Radcliffe]]\n* [[Tom Vaughan-Lawlor]] as Robert Fowle\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Conception and adaptation===\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = \"It's like dot-to-dot.

Bernstein believed that Hood's past work contained \"a romantic sensibility... There is a poetic quality about his writing as well as there being a rigorous emotional truth which I thought was important for Jane.\"<ref name=writingstudio/> Hood was attracted to the film because he believed \"the story is such an important one and very much the inspiration for ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''.\"<ref name=writingstudio/> Calling Austen a \"genius\" and \"one of the top two or three prose writers of all time\", Hood thought that her relationship with Lefroy \"was absolutely essential in shaping her work.\"<ref name=writingstudio/> Hood acknowledged however that ''Becoming Jane'' is \"based on the facts as they are known and the majority of characters did exist, as did many of the situations and circumstances in the film. Some have been fictionalised, weaving together what we know about Austen's world from her books and letters, creating a rich Austenite landscape.\"<ref name=writingstudio/>\n\n[[Julian Jarrold]] became attached to direct the film in early 2005.<ref name=writingstudio/> It was his second feature film, after ''[[Kinky Boots (film)|Kinky Boots]]'', which was released later that year.<ref name=JarroldIFTN>{{cite web |url=http://www.iftn.ie/news/?act1=record&only=1&aid=73&rid=4280085&tpl=archnews&force=1 |title=Julian Jarrold On 'Becoming Jane' |publisher=Irish Film & Television Network |date=15 March 2007 |access-date=2 August 2012}}</ref> According to Bernstein, he \"liked [Jarrold's] style as it was modern and visceral, and I just had a feeling that he was the right choice. This piece needed to be handed with delicacy but also with a certain amount of brio and Julian was able to bring those two things to the production.\"<ref name=writingstudio/> The director began work on the project in early 2006, rereading the novels ''Pride and Prejudice'', ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'', and ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' and also reviewing Austen biographies such as Spence's book. Jarrold depended most heavily on the script, calling it \"a rich, witty and clever screenplay from someone who obviously knew his subject very well. It is a love story but much more besides. Kevin's screenplay has so many layers and interesting ideas. Apart from the love story I was very attracted by the themes of imagination and experience.\"<ref name=writingstudio/> The director intended to \"bring Austen up to date by roughening her up a bit\" and adding \"more life and energy and fun,\" opining that past Austen adaptations had been \"a little bit picture-postcard and safe and sweet and nice.\"<ref name=Higson185/>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Anne Hathaway at MIFF.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Anne Hathaway]] focused on learning an English accent, believing that if she \"didn't get that right, the rest of the performance wouldn't matter because people would write me off in the first five minutes.\"<ref>{{citation  |url=  |title=From princess to pauper |work=[[Winnipeg Free Press]] |via=|first=Randall |last=King |date=4 August 2007 }}</ref>]]\n\nJarrold sought to make ''Becoming Jane'' \"look and feel\" realistic \"so everything is not lit in a very glamorous Hollywood way.\"<ref name=\"felce\"/> According to him, \"One of the key ideas in the film was to get away from the old, stuffy costume drama kind of feel of what Jane Austen is and to look at somebody before she becomes a genius, when she is in her early twenties and on the verge of writing her great thing; she had a real exuberance for life, intelligent and independent and a sort of outsider in rural Hampshire, more intelligent than the people around her and kicking against all those pressures.\"<ref name=\"felce\"/> To further set his film apart from other costume dramas, American actress [[Anne Hathaway]] was cast as the title character. A fan of [[Jane Austen]] since she was fourteen, Hathaway immediately began rereading Austen's books, conducting historical research including perusing the author's letters, and also learned sign language, calligraphy, dance choreography, and playing the piano. She moved to England a month before production began to improve her English accent, and attempted to stay in character throughout filming, the first time she had done so for a movie.<ref name=\"felce\"/>\n\n[[File:James McAvoy Cannes 2014.jpg|[[James McAvoy]] stars as Thomas Langlois Lefroy.|thumb|200px]]\n\nThere were concerns in some quarters that the American Hathaway was playing a beloved English writer. [[James McAvoy]], who plays [[Thomas Langlois Lefroy]], believed that filming in Ireland made her casting \"a bit safer\" than if they had shot in England. McAvoy accepted the role because he enjoyed Austen's writings and was eager to work with Jarrold, having collaborated with him previously on the 2002 television production ''[[White Teeth#Adaptations|White Teeth]]''.<ref name=LevineMarch7/> McAvoy first assumed that ''Becoming Jane'' would be directly associated with ''Pride and Prejudice'', with his character possessing similarities with [[Mr. Darcy]]; the actor soon realised however \"that the screenplay was nothing like ''Pride and Prejudice''. The screenwriter probably speculated on some of the inspiration for ''Pride and Prejudice'' but it is a completely different story.\"<ref name=writingstudio/>\n\n[[Julie Walters]] had once disliked Austen's writings but changed her mind when she read ''Pride and Prejudice'' after receiving her role as Mrs. Austen.<ref name=LevineMarch7>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/interviews/a43620/becoming-jane-james-mcavoy-julie-walters.html |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |title='Becoming Jane': James McAvoy, Julie Walters |first=Nick |last=Levine |date=7 March 2007 |access-date=6 July 2012}}</ref> Appearing as Mr. Austen was actor [[James Cromwell]], who viewed his character as \"a generous gentleman, well educated and supportive of Jane for the most part. He is bedevilled by his financial circumstances but deeply in love with his wife and sympathetic to her concerns about what will happen to the girls if they don't marry.\"<ref name=writingstudio/> [[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]] portrayed Henry Austen, while [[Lucy Cohu]] played the widowed [[Eliza de Feuillide]], the Austens' worldly cousin and Henry's romantic interest. Cohu believed that her character \"needs security. She is looking to be safe. She finds that security with Henry as she knows the Austen family.\"<ref name=writingstudio/>\n\n[[Anna Maxwell Martin]] appeared as Jane's sister [[Cassandra Austen|Cassandra]]. The actress called her character \"terribly sensible\", noting that she \"gets her heart broken. It's very sad. She's the levelling force for Jane Austen, the wild one.

She was interested in both the effects of continental fashions on English clothing and the differences between social classes.<ref name=writingstudio/> While she recognised that 1795 \"marked the beginning\" of the [[empire silhouette|empire waistline]] trend, N\u00ed Mhaoldhomhnaigh also understood this fashion would have barely been introduced to Austen's circle in the country; rather, the film displayed many costume designs from the [[1775\u201395 in fashion|early 1790s]]. She explained, \"We wanted to show that transition especially for the women. The look in London is very different from the look in the countryside. For the country ball the fashion for the older women is more of the old style but for the younger women we show the introduction of the Empire line.\"<ref name=writingstudio/>\n\nThe costume designer created all of Hathaway's outfits from scratch, and \"looked for images of a young Jane Austen.\"<ref name=writingstudio/> N\u00ed Mhaoldhomhnaigh explained, \"I wanted to get her youthfulness and innocence across through her dress. But crucially there was also her strength of character. So we kept away from frills and flounces. I wanted a definite look that was quite strong but also pretty at the same time. Jane was living on a working farm so her dress had to be practical as well. In terms of the costume we were definitely trying to steer away from the chocolate box image that we associate with Jane Austen.\"<ref name=writingstudio/>\n\nN\u00ed Mhaoldhomhnaigh dressed McAvoy in rich fabrics, such as velvet and [[beaver]] fur, to help distinguish him from the other men. She recalled that \"he wears very stylish waist coats and cut-away jackets. With Jane around he'd have an extra swagger in front of her. James (McAvoy) was really into it. We'd talk about the colours and fabrics to achieve his distinctive look.\"<ref name=writingstudio/> N\u00ed Mhaoldhomhnaigh and Maggie Smith agreed that Lady Gresham's dresses would be modelled after [[1750\u201375 in fashion|1770s]] fashion, which was \"the sort of dress that the character would have worn when she was much younger and suited her back then. Lady Gresham is very much her own character and is not someone who is dictated to by fashion.\"<ref name=writingstudio/> Smith's dresses contained stiff fabrics \"to emphasise a woman who was very set in her ways\".<ref name=writingstudio/>\n\n===Filming===\nProduced independently by Ecosse,<ref name=\"JarroldIFTN\" /> ''Becoming Jane'' was given a limited budget of \u20ac12.7 million (\u00a39 million or $16.5 million).<ref name=\"williams\"/><ref name=irishfilmboard>{{Cite web |url=http://www.irishfilmboard.ie/irish_film_industry/news/Becoming_Jane_in_Irish_cinemas_this_weekend/513 |title=Becoming Jane in Irish cinemas this weekend |publisher=[[Irish Film Board]] |date=13 March 2007 |access-date=11 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113122625/http://www.irishfilmboard.ie/irish_film_industry/news/Becoming_Jane_in_Irish_cinemas_this_weekend/513 |archive-date=13 January 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2007/BJANE.php |title=Becoming Jane |publisher=The Numbers|access-date=1 August 2012}}</ref> Production designer Eve Stewart researched Regency literature and Austen's life, and along with Jarrold, scouted locations in Dublin and nearby counties for five weeks in January and February 2006.<ref name=writingstudio/> They ultimately opted to shoot in Dublin and the [[Counties of Ireland|Irish counties]] of [[County Meath|Meath]] and [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]] instead of [[Hampshire]], the birthplace of Austen,<ref name=JarroldIFTN/> because it held \"a sense of countryside that felt more unchanged,\" while Hampshire had unfortunately become too \"groomed and manicured\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thedubliner.ie/the_dubliner_magazine/2008/02/dublin-but-not.html |work=The Dubliner |title=Dublin, but not as we know it |first=Eleanor |last=Fitzsimons |date=5 February 2008 |access-date=6 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424085537/http://www.thedubliner.ie/the_dubliner_magazine/2008/02/dublin-but-not.html |archive-date=24 April 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Jarrold also found \"a great variety of Georgian houses and older houses\" in Ireland.<ref name=\"felce\"/> His production received funds from the [[Irish Film Board]],<ref name=\"felce\"/> the [[UK Film Council]] Premiere Fund,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ukfilmcouncil.eu/awards?awardid=10488 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201215/http://ukfilmcouncil.eu/awards?awardid=10488 |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 October 2013 |title=Awards database |publisher=UK Film Council Lottery |access-date=9 July 2012 }}</ref><ref>Higson, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> [[2 Entertain]], Scion Films, and [[Miramax Films]].<ref name=Minister12April/> Film critic [[Andrew Sarris]] noted that in Ireland \"happily, there are still architectural traces of life more than 200 years ago to correspond with the year 1795.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://observer.com/2007/07/austen-in-love/ |work=[[The Observer]] |title=Austen in Love |first=Andrew |last=Sarris |author-link=Andrew Sarris |date=31 July 2007 |access-date=6 July 2012}}</ref> However, Ireland did include a few disadvantages: Stewart found that \"the rural aspects were the most difficult as the Irish country landscape is nothing like Hampshire.

the film was based on, identifies \"Tom Lefroy as the love of Austen's life and her relationship with him as the origin of her genius. But he never suggests that there was an aborted elopement (much less subsequent reading sessions with any of Lefroy's children). And he is careful, as the filmmakers are not, to clarify that in speculating about Austen's romantic experience he is reading between the lines of the family records and of the three rather opaque Austen letters that are his principal sources.\"<ref>{{Cite news |title = See Jane Elope |url = http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2007/08/see_jane_elope.html|newspaper = Slate|date = 2007-08-03 |access-date = 2016-02-16|issn = 1091-2339 |first = Deidre |last = Lynch }}</ref>\n\nAn important deviation of the film's plot from history is that there is scant evidence in real life Austen and Lefroy's relationship went beyond acquaintance. Rather, all that is known of them together is that they danced at three Christmas balls before Tom returned to school and that Jane was \"too proud\" to ask his aunt about him two years later. In the latter years of Tom Lefroy's life, he was questioned about his relationship with Jane Austen by his nephew, and admitted to having loved Jane Austen, but stated that it was a \"boyish love\".<ref>{{Cite book|title = Becoming Jane Austen|last = Spence|first = Jon|publisher = Hambledon Continuum|year = 2003|location = London}}</ref> As is written in a letter sent from T.E.P. Lefroy to James Edward Austen Leigh in 1870,<blockquote>My late venerable uncle ... said in so many words that he was in love with her, although he qualified his confession by saying it was a boyish love.

The numerous intertextual connections between both movies can be reduced to one:  just as Shakespeare is imagined as the hero of his own play, Jane Austen becomes the heroine of her own novel.\" Among other listed similarities, they noted that the romantic interests of both protagonists serve as their literary muses, and that the middle part of both films \"lie\" when viewed from a historical perspective.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.jasna.org/persuasions/on-line/vol29no1/cano-garcia.html |title=Becoming Shakespeare and Jane Austen in Love: An Intertextual Dialogue between Two Biopics |first=Marina |last=Cano L\u00f3pez |author2=Rosa Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda-Periago |journal=Persuasions On-Line |publisher=Jane Austen Society of North America |volume=29 |number=1 |date=Winter 2008 |access-date=2 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n===Premiere, theatrical release, distribution and box office===\nThe [[Film premiere|world premiere]] of ''Becoming Jane'' took place in London on 5 March 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6418655.stm | title =Star misses Jane Austen premiere |date=5 March 2007 |access-date =16 July 2012 | publisher = [[BBC]]}}</ref> It was released to cinemas on 9 March 2007 in the United Kingdom<ref>{{cite web | url =http://industry.bfi.org.uk/article/12434/March-2007 | title =March 2007 |access-date =16 July 2012 | publisher = [[British Film Institute]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/mar/10/features16.theguide | title =In cinemas this weekend |date=9 March 2007 |access-date =28 July 2010 | work= [[The Guardian]]}}</ref> and a week later in Ireland by [[Buena Vista International]].<ref name=JarroldIFTN/> It ultimately grossed \u00a33.78 million in the UK and Ireland, placing in sixteenth among all UK films for the year in those markets.
