The film was written and directed by [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller]] in their directorial debuts, and features the voices of [[Bill Hader]], [[Anna Faris]], [[James Caan]], [[Andy Samberg]], [[Bruce Campbell]], [[Mr. T]], [[Benjamin Bratt]], and [[Neil Patrick Harris]]. The film centers around an aspiring inventor named Flint Lockwood who develops, following a series of failed experiments, a machine that can convert water into food. After the machine gains sentience and begins to develop food storms, Flint must stop it in order to save the world.\n\nThe film premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on September 12, 2009, and was released in the United States six days later on September 18 by [[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group#Sony Pictures Releasing|Sony Pictures Releasing]] under its [[Columbia Pictures]] label. It earned over $243 million worldwide on a budget of $100 million at the box office.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo\" /> The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its colorful visuals, humor, characters, voice acting, and the score, while the simple character designs were said to be unfitting. The film has since been expanded into a [[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (franchise)|franchise]], with a sequel, ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2]]'', released on September 27, 2013, as well as an [[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (TV series)|animated television series based on the film]] that premiered on [[Cartoon Network]] on February 20, 2017, with none of the original cast returning.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\n<!-- Plot section is an outline of the film, NOT a blow-by-blow account of everything you can remember -->\nAspiring scientist Flint Lockwood lives with his widowed father, Tim, and his monkey assistant, Steve, in Swallow Falls, an island in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] with an economy based on [[sardines as food|sardines]]. As sardines are considered unsavory by the rest of the world, the island's economy declines, forcing its citizens to subsist on a mainly sardine-based diet. One day, Flint develops the Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator, a device that converts water into food, in an effort to expand the town's diet, much to the chagrin of Tim, who, annoyed by Flint's failed contraptions, wants him to run the family business instead. Flint's first attempt to plug in the device knocks out his house's power, so he connects the FLDSMDFR to a local substation, overloading it and sending it rocketing across town, demolishing Sardine Land, a sardine-themed amusement park meant to revitalize the town, and disappearing into the sky. The chaos earns Flint the fury of the town, of amateur field reporter Sam Sparks, and the disappointment of Tim.\n\nSoon after, cheeseburgers start falling from the sky and Flint realizes the FLDSMDFR is functioning successfully in the stratosphere, using the condensation from clouds to create food-based weather systems while keeping itself afloat. The citizens of Swallow Falls rejoice in their new food choices, renaming it Chewandswallow, and it becomes a \"food tourism\" destination, making Flint an international celebrity. Flint and Sam grow closer after she reveals that she was teased as a child for her glasses and her fascination with meteorology. However, Flint notices the FLDSMDFR's food has begun to gradually become bigger in size, due to the FLDSMDFR's creations mutating in the atmosphere, having been overloaded by the massive amounts of water vapor. He attempts to warn the town's mayor about the FLDSMDFR's malfunction, though the mayor is too concerned about profit and ignores him.\n\nAfter a tornado made of spaghetti threatens the town, Flint attempts to shut the FLDSMDFR down, only for the mayor to inadvertently destroy the console while trying to stop him, causing the machine to go rogue and generate a massive storm. Flint creates a USB flash drive designed to shut down the FLDSMDFR and uses his repurposed flying car to reach it, accompanied by Steve, Sam, her cameraman Manny, and the town's former mascot Brent. Upon reaching the FLDSMDFR, they discover it has surrounded itself in a giant meatball-like object made of food for protection. As the group bores inside, the flash drive is destroyed, prompting Flint to call Tim and instruct him to email the drive's code to his cell phone via his laboratory's computer. On reaching the FLDSMDFR, Flint connects his phone with the flash drive's code sent to it by Tim, only to discover that the wrong file was sent. All appears lost until Flint uses his Spray-On Shoes formula on the machine, causing it to explode and destroy the meatball, ending the storm. After surviving the destruction, Flint reunites with Tim, who finally shows appreciation for his son's inventions, and Sam, with whom he shares a kiss.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Bill Hader]] as Flint Lockwood, an unsuccessful and timid but determined young inventor, and Sam's love interest.

[[Paul and Ga\u00ebtan Brizzi|The Brizzi brothers]] were brought to direct the film, with Wayne Rice adapting the screenplay.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ball|first=Ryan|title=Sony Taps Six to Direct Animates Slate|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/features/sony-taps-six-to-direct-animated-slate/|access-date=September 28, 2012|newspaper=Animation Magazine|date=May 9, 2003}}</ref> In 2006, it was reported that the film had been helmed by new directors and writers, [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Nguyen |first=Hanh |url=http://www.zap2it.com/movies/news/zap-sonycloudywithachanceofmeatballs,0,1483855.story |title=Sony Forecasts 'Chance of Meatballs' |work=Zap2it |date=August 16, 2006 |access-date=July 31, 2011}}</ref> Lord and Miller said later that year that it would be a homage to, and a parody of, disaster films such as ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'', ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'', ''[[The Core]]'', and ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sliceofscifi.com/2006/08/16/its-rainingfood |title=It's Raining.........Food? |access-date=November 25, 2010 |last=Sloan |first=Sam |date=August 16, 2006 |work=Slice of SciFi |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002233444/http://www.sliceofscifi.com/2006/08/16/its-rainingfood/ |archive-date=October 2, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Story and script ===\nAfter a year working on the script, Lord and Christopher Miller were fired for story issues and replaced with new writers, who after a year were also fired. Lord and Miller were then re-hired in 2006. The two completely redid the script, this time with the creative input of their crew. The new draft had the protagonist as a failed inventor who wanted to prove himself to his town. The two were almost fired again after [[Amy Pascal]], then-head of [[Sony Pictures]], criticized the film for lack of story. Although the film succeeded on the comedic front in the animatic stage, Pascal cited the lack of an anchoring relationship in the film as a failure in the story telling. Unable to create new characters and environments to suit the new story demands, the two elevated the character of the tackle shop extra to be the protagonist's father, thereby creating the relationship Pascal had requested. The pair's experience on ''Cloudy'' taught them two valuable lessons: the power of creative collaboration and the importance of emotion in a story.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeP9fSlmgjc |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211215/LeP9fSlmgjc |archive-date=2021-12-15 |url-status=live|title=Rewriting Collective Insights: Phil Lord at TEDxCoconutGrove |author= Phil Lord |publisher= TEDx Talks|date=October 11, 2012|access-date=September 20, 2018 |via= [[YouTube]] }}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nOn September 18, 2008, [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] announced that [[Bill Hader]] and [[Anna Faris]] had signed on to voice the two lead characters, with [[James Caan]], [[Bruce Campbell]], [[Mr. T]], [[Andy Samberg]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Bobb'e J.
