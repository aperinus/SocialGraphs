It stars [[Jean Reno]], [[Christina Applegate]], [[Christian Clavier]], [[Malcolm McDowell]], [[Tara Reid]], and [[Bridgette Wilson]]. It follows a medieval knight and his serf who travel to 21st-century Chicago, meeting the knight's descendant.\n\nUnlike the original film, the remake was not successful in either France or the United States.\n\nThis was [[Hollywood Pictures]]' final production before it folded into the management of its sister company, [[Touchstone Pictures]] until Hollywood Pictures released the 2006 horror movie ''[[Stay Alive]]'' and is one of the last films to be distributed by it.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film takes place in 12th-century [[England]], where Count Thibault Malef\u00e8te is about to marry Princess Rosalind, the daughter of the reigning King.\n\nAt the wedding banquet, an enemy known as the [[Earl of Warwick]] accidentally gives Thibault a potion which makes him [[hallucinate]] (and which was actually intended for Rosalind by a witch hired by the Earl), and under its influence, he kills his own bride believing she is a ferocious monster. While under sentence of death, he asks his servant, Andr\u00e9 Le Pat\u00e9 to find a wizard to help him. The wizard gives him a potion that will send him back to the moment before he killed Princess Rosalind. The wizard botches the spell, and instead, Thibault and Andre are sent into the 21st century.\n\nThey end up in a [[museum]] in [[Chicago]] where they are arrested by the police after causing much panic, mischief, and chaos. They are rescued by Julia Malef\u00e8te, a museum employee who closely resembles Princess Rosalind. She thinks that Thibault is her distant French cousin who drowned while [[yachting]] a couple of years ago. However, Thibault soon finds out that Julia is descended from his family and realizes he must return to the 12th century to correct the past.\n\nJulia introduces them to the modern American style of life where [[norm (sociology)|norms]] from medieval times no longer apply. Before they return to his time, Thibault decides to protect Julia from her money-hungry fiance, Hunter. Meanwhile, Andre falls for a [[gardener]], Angelique who presents him with the world of equal rights for all people.\n\nThe wizard realizes his mistake and decides to time travel into the future to help Thibault. After he finds him, he successfully prepares a potion to return to the past. Andr\u00e9 confronts Thibault, telling him he does not want to return to the 12th century, Julia convinces Thibault that he should set him free. Hunter tries to prevent Thibault from interfering with his plans but Julia finds out his real intentions and breaks up with him. Before he leaves, Thibault tells Julia that she will meet a new and better man to marry. Then, he and the wizard drink the potion in the museum and return to the past just before the murder of Princess Rosalind. Hunter finds and drinks the remainder of the potion which sends him to the 12th century where he is captured.\n\nJulia decides to reclaim her ancestral castle, much to the firm's delight, and meets a man named Francois Le Combier, who knows a great deal about her family's history. In the last scene, Andr\u00e9 and Angelique are seen driving in a hot rod towards [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], and Andr\u00e9 wonders one thing, who would protect him from the Devil? Angelique simply replies \"Hey, at least you got me, babe\", to which Andr\u00e9 happily agrees.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jean Reno]] as Thibault\n*[[Christina Applegate]] as Rosalind / Julia\n*[[Christian Clavier]] as Andre\n*[[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]] as Hunter\n*[[Tara Reid]] as Angelique\n*[[Bridgette Wilson-Sampras]] as Amber\n*[[John Aylward]] as Byron\n*[[George Plimpton]] as Dr. Brady\n*[[Malcolm McDowell]] as Wizard\n*[[Alexis Loret]] as Fran\u00e7ois\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Just Visiting\n| type         = [[Film score]]\n| artist       = [[John Powell (composer)|John Powell]]\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = April 10, 2001\n| recorded     = 2001\n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = [[Film score|Score]]\n| length       = 36:02\n| label        = [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]]\n| producer     = \n| prev_title   = \n| prev_year    = \n| next_title   = \n| next_year    = \n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| total_length = 36:02\n| title1 = Thibault Goes to England\n| length1 = 2:39\n| title2 = The Hag's Hut\n| length2 = 2:28\n| title3 = Rosalind & Thibault\n| length3 = 1:31\n| title4 = Hallucination and Execution\n| length4 = 1:10\n| title5 = To Chicago\n| length5 = 0:47\n| title6 = Kill the Car\n| length6 = 1:59\n| title7 = Thibault Sees Julia\n| length7 = 1:16\n| title8 = My Cousin, My Descendant\n| length8 = 1:28\n| title9 = Ode de Toilet\n| length9 = 0:26\n| title10 = Tub for Two\n| length10 = 1:03\n| title11 = So Many Descendants\n| length11 = 0:21\n| title12 = Kissing Cousins\n| length12 = 0:38\n| title13 = Searching for a Wizard\n| length13 = 0:50\n| title14 = Another Visitor\n| length14 = 0:44\n| title15 = On the Bridge\n| length15 = 1:55\n| title16 = Feel Like a Lady\n| length16 = 1:04\n| title17 = Andre Can't Ask\n| length17 = 0:34\n| title18 = The Wizard Pulls Himself Together\n| length18 = 1:02\n| title19 = The Wizard Cooks\n| length19 = 0:39\n| title20 = Andre Asks to Stay\n| length20 = 0:57\n| title21 = Not a Bunny\n| length21 = 1:04\n| title22 = The Big Chase\n| length22 = 2:01\n| title23 = What Will I Do Without You\n| length23 = 1:45\n| title24 = Thibault and the Wizard Return Home\n| length24 = 1:52\n| title25 = In the Icehall\n| length25 = 1:08\n| title26 = Hunter Gets It / Julia Sees the Castle\n| length26 = 1:43\n| title27 = Your Time Will Come\n| length27 = 2:56\n| note27 = performed by Kudson Kai\n}}\n\n==Home video==\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD on September 11, 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hive4media.com/buying_guide/scripts/bg_matrix.cfm?studiosort=5,6,7,8,53|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010908072615/http://hive4media.com/buying_guide/scripts/bg_matrix.cfm?studiosort=5,6,7,8,53|title=Announcements|website=hive4media.com|archive-date=September 8, 2001|access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Box office==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{Expand section|date=January 2015}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\n}}\nThe film opened at {{abbr|No.|Number}} 12 at the North American box office making $2,272,489 [[USD]] in its opening weekend.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Anchor|Reviews|Critics}} \n{{Expand section|date=January 2015}}\nThe film received generally negative reviews.
