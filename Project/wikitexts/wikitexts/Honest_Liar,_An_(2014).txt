Geller famously failed to perform his feats under controlled conditions during a 1973 appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson]]'', after Randi supervised the staff of that program on the proper handling of the materials used in the performance to prevent cheating.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n''An Honest Liar'' documents [[James Randi]]'s early life as a carnival-bound refugee from [[Toronto]] who, early on, dedicated himself to learning every trick performed by [[Harry Houdini]], and even improving on some of them. In one of his feats as an escape artist, Randi frees himself from a [[straitjacket]] while being hung upside down by his ankles over [[Niagara Falls]].\n\nAge and concerns over the danger of his profession and his health leads him to retire from that occupation and seek out not only a new career, but a crusading obsession that makes him a pop cultural fixture by the 1970s: As a [[scientific skeptic]] investigator and challenger to [[pseudoscientific]] and [[paranormal]] claims, which leads him to expose the deceit behind religious [[faith healers]], psychics, and other con artists who exploit the public. Randi becomes a recurring guest on ''[[The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson]]'', and makes appearances on TV shows such as ''[[Happy Days]]'' and in rock music artist [[Alice Cooper]]'s 1973 ''[[Billion Dollar Babies]]'' tour, where Randi, portraying the Executioner, decapitates Cooper at the end of each performance.\n\nThe film spotlights some of the more notable targets investigated and debunked by Randi. One is mentalist [[Uri Geller]], who performed [[psychic]] feats on the talk show circuit, such as bending a spoon with minimal contact, and guessing the contents of sealed envelopes and other objects. Randi worked closely with the staff of ''The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson'' prior to a 1973 appearance on that program by Geller, who publicly claimed at the time that his acts were performed with genuine psychic ability, and not magic tricks. Randi had ''The Tonight Show'' staff observe strict [[Scientific control|controls]] over the materials that Geller would work with during his appearance to prevent any trickery or cheating. As a result, Geller was unable to perform any of the feats that he regularly performed on other TV shows. Another target is faith healer [[Peter Popoff]], who during his church revival meetings, demonstrated personal knowledge of people in the audience, such as their names, addresses and illnesses, which he stated was due to the work of God. Randi discovered that the true source of this information was a radio in Popoff's ear with which he was fed information by his wife. Another venture on which Randi embarked had him perpetrating a hoax on the Australian public in which a young man claimed on Australian television to channel the spirit of an ancient seer. The man was in reality Randi's partner, performance artist Jos\u00e9 Alvarez. In another, Randi had two confederates, mentalist [[Banachek|Steve Shaw]] and actor Michael Edwards, [[Project Alpha (hoax)|pose as mentalists]] in a Washington University in St. Louis study that mistakenly confirmed Geller as an actual psychic.\n\nThe film also details Randi's longtime relationship with Alvarez, his decision to publicly [[coming out|come out]] at age 81, and how Alvarez, at the time of filming, had recently been discovered to be living under a false identity, which leads to legal ramifications for the couple.\n\n==Production==\nIn 2012 producers Tyler Measom and Justin Weinstein visited James Randi at his home in [[Plantation, Florida]] to express interest in filming a documentary about his life. To illustrate their bona fides to him, they gave him copies of their previous documentaries. Randi comments, \"When I saw the product that they had turned out, I thought to myself, 'These are the guys. These are the guys that I think I can trust with my life story.'\"<ref>[[Sturgess, Kylie]] (March/April 2015). \"Behind the Magic: An Interview with James Randi\".

Though Roeper thought that the film lost some momentum when exploring the minutiae of the Washington University hoax, and found the shift in focus of the last third of the film to the matter of Jos\u00e9 Alvarez's identity jarring, Roeper stated that Randi deserves a standing ovation for his work, and called the film \"an honest portrait\" of him.<ref>[[Roeper, Richard]] (2015).
