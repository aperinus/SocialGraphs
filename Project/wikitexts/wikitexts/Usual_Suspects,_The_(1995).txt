It stars [[Stephen Baldwin]], [[Gabriel Byrne]], [[Benicio del Toro]], [[Kevin Pollak]], [[Chazz Palminteri]], [[Pete Postlethwaite]], and [[Kevin Spacey]].\n\nThe plot follows the interrogation of Roger \"Verbal\" Kint, a small-time [[Confidence trick|con man]], who is one of only two survivors of a massacre and fire on a ship docked at the [[Port of Los Angeles]]. Through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] and [[narration]], Kint tells an interrogator a convoluted story of events that led him and his criminal companions to the boat, and of a mysterious crime lord\u2014known as [[Keyser S\u00f6ze]]\u2014who controlled them. The film was shot on a $6 million budget and began as a title taken from a column in ''[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]'' magazine called ''The Usual Suspects'', after one of [[Claude Rains]]' most memorable lines in the classic film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', and Singer thought that it would make a good title for a film.\n\nThe film was shown out of competition at the [[1995 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3358/year/1995.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Usual Suspects |access-date=September 8, 2009 |work=festival-cannes.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822190857/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3358/year/1995.html|archive-date=August 22, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> and then initially released in a few theaters. It received favorable reviews and was eventually given a wider release. McQuarrie won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] and Spacey won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance. The [[Writers Guild of America]] ranked the film as having the 35th greatest screenplay of all time.<ref name=\"WGA101\"/>\n\n== Plot ==\nCareer criminal Dean Keaton lies badly wounded on a ship docked in [[San Pedro Bay (California)|San Pedro Bay]]. He is confronted by a mysterious figure he calls \"Keyser,\" who shoots him dead and sets fire to the ship. The next day, the police recover 27 bodies and only two survivors: Arkosh Kovash (\"\u00c1kos Kov\u00e1cs\"), a Hungarian mobster hospitalized with severe burns, and Roger \"Verbal\" Kint, a con artist. [[U.S. Customs]] agent Dave Kujan flies to Los Angeles from New York City to interrogate Verbal. The men are left alone in a borrowed office belonging to [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] police sergeant Jeff Rabin while FBI agent Jack Baer visits a hospitalized Kovash. The events that led Keaton, Verbal, and their associates onto the ship are then described by Verbal via [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]].\n\nSix weeks earlier in [[New York City]], Keaton and Verbal are arrested alongside fellow criminals Michael McManus, Fred Fenster, and Todd Hockney and placed in a [[police lineup]] as suspects in a truck hijacking that none of them admits to participating in. Believing the police were unfairly harassing them, McManus proposes they pull a heist to get revenge on the [[NYPD]]. Trying to go straight, Keaton initially refuses but eventually agrees to help rob a jewel smuggler being escorted by corrupt cops, netting millions in emeralds, getting over fifty cops arrested after leaking their activities to the press. They then go to California to [[fence (criminal)|fence]] the jewels through a man named Redfoot, who connects them with another jewel heist, but it goes badly and the contents are instead revealed to be [[\u0391-Methylfentanyl|China White]] (synthetic heroin). The men learn that the job was arranged by a lawyer named Kobayashi, who says he arranged for their arrests in New York and that his employer, mysterious Turkish crime lord [[Keyser S\u00f6ze]], from whom each of the men has unwittingly stolen, has ordered them to raid a ship holding Argentinian drug dealers and destroy $91 million worth of cocaine being sold on board. The cash brought for the exchange will be their reward.\n\nDuring Kujan's interrogation, it is learned that there was no cocaine on the ship and S\u00f6ze was seen onboard. Verbal then tells Kujan a legend about S\u00f6ze: he was a small-time [[drug runner]] who murdered his own family when they were being held hostage by Hungarian mobsters, then massacred the mobsters and their families before disappearing, and from then on conducted business only indirectly through underlings who are mostly unfamiliar with their true employer. S\u00f6ze thus became a fearsome [[urban legend]], \"a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night.\"\n\nConcluding his story, Verbal reveals Fenster was killed trying to flee; the men then threatened Kobayashi, only to accept the assignment when he threatened their loved ones. The men attacked the ship during the night, killing several Argentinian and Hungarian gangsters before discovering that there was no cocaine. An unseen assailant killed Hockney, McManus, Keaton, and a prisoner in one of the ship's cabins. The mysterious figure then set fire to the ship as Verbal looked on from a hiding place on the dock.\n\nKujan deduces that Keaton must be S\u00f6ze, as the prisoner killed on the ship was Arturo Marquez, a smuggler who escaped prosecution by claiming he could identify S\u00f6ze. Marquez was represented by lawyer Edie Finneran, Keaton's girlfriend, who was recently murdered. Kujan claims that the Argentinians took Marquez to sell him to S\u00f6ze's Hungarian rivals. Keaton then used the assault so that he could kill Marquez personally and fake his own death. Verbal finally confesses that Keaton had been behind everything but refuses to testify in court. Verbal's bail is posted, and he is released.\n\nMoments later, Kujan realizes Verbal apparently [[Unreliable narrator|fabricated his entire story]] by piecing together details from random items in Rabin's cluttered office. At the same time, Baer interrogates Kovash in his hospital bed, along with a [[police artist]] who is creating a sketch. Meanwhile, Verbal walks outside, gradually losing his limp and flexing his supposedly disabled hand. As Kujan pursues Verbal, a fax arrives at the police station with the artist's [[facial composite]] of S\u00f6ze. The picture resembles Verbal, revealing that he was S\u00f6ze the entire time. Verbal/S\u00f6ze enters a car driven by \"Kobayashi\" and leaves moments before Kujan arrives on the scene.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as Roger 'Verbal' Kint:\n:Singer and McQuarrie sent the screenplay for the film to Spacey without telling him which role was written for him. Spacey called Singer and told them that he was interested in the roles of Keaton and Kujan but was also intrigued by Kint who, as it turned out, was the role McQuarrie wrote with Spacey in mind.<ref name=\"Burnett\" />\n* [[Gabriel Byrne]] as Dean Keaton:\n:Kevin Spacey met Byrne at a party and asked him to do the film. He read the screenplay and turned it down, thinking that the filmmakers could not pull it off. Byrne met screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie and Singer and was impressed by the latter's vision for the film. However, Byrne was also dealing with some personal problems at the time and backed out for 24 hours until the filmmakers agreed to shoot the film in [[Los Angeles]], where Byrne lived, and make it in five weeks.<ref name=\"Burnett\" />\n* [[Chazz Palminteri]] as Agent Dave Kujan:\n:Singer had always wanted Palminteri for the film, but he was always unavailable. The role was offered to [[Christopher Walken]] and [[Robert De Niro]], both of whom turned it down. The filmmakers even had [[Al Pacino]] come in and read for the part, but he decided not to do it because he had just played a cop in ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]''. Pacino would later say it was the one film he has regretted turning down the most. Palminteri became available, but only for a week. When he signed on, this persuaded the film's financial backers to support the film fully because he was a sufficiently high-profile star, thanks to the recent releases of ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'' and ''[[Bullets Over Broadway]].''<ref name=\"Burnett\" />\n* [[Stephen Baldwin]] as Michael McManus:\n:Baldwin was tired of doing independent films where his expectations were not met; when he met with director Bryan Singer, he went into a 15-minute tirade telling him what it was like to work with him. After Baldwin was finished, Singer told him exactly what he expected and wanted, which impressed Baldwin.<ref name=\"Burnett\">{{cite news |last=Burnett |first=Robert Meyer |title=Round Up: Deposing The ''Usual Suspects'' |work=The Usual Suspects Special Edition DVD |publisher=[[MGM]] |year=2002}}</ref>\n* [[Benicio del Toro]] as Fred Fenster:\n:Spacey suggested del Toro for the role. The character was originally written with a [[Harry Dean Stanton]]-type actor in mind. Del Toro met with Singer and the film's casting director and told them that he did not want to audition because he did not feel comfortable doing them.<ref name=\"Burnett\" /> After reading the script, del Toro realized that his character's only purpose was to be killed to demonstrate S\u00f6ze's power, and did not have any meaningful impact on the story. As a result, del Toro developed Fenster's unique, garbled speech pattern to make him more memorable as a character.<ref name=\"Planas\">{{cite news |last=Planas |first=Roque |title=Benicio Del Toro's Weird Accent In 'The Usual Suspects' Should Have Won The Oscar For Best Foreign Film |date=January 30, 2015 |work=[[Huffington Post]]}}</ref>\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as Todd Hockney:\n:He met with Singer about doing the film, but when he heard that two other actors were auditioning for the role, he came back, auditioned, and got the part.<ref name=\"Burnett\" />\n* [[Pete Postlethwaite]] as Kobayashi\n* [[Suzy Amis Cameron|Suzy Amis]] as Edie Finneran\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as FBI Agent Jack Baer\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Sergeant Jeff Rabin\n* [[C\u00e1stulo Guerra]] as Arturo Marquez\n* [[Peter Greene]] as Redfoot (uncredited)\n* Scott B.

Financiers wanted established stars, and offers for the small role of Redfoot (the L.A. fence who hooks up the five protagonists with Kobayashi) went out to [[Christopher Walken]], [[Tommy Lee Jones]], [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Charlie Sheen]], [[James Spader]], [[Al Pacino]], and [[Johnny Cash]].<ref name=\"nashawaty\" /> However, the European money allowed the film's producers to make offers to actors and assemble a cast. They were able to offer the actors only salaries that were well below their usual pay, but they agreed because of the quality of McQuarrie's script and the chance to work with one another.<ref name=\"hartl\" /> That money fell through, and Singer used the script and the cast to attract PolyGram to pick up the film negative.<ref name=\"reporter\" />\n\nAbout casting, Singer said, \"You pick people not for what they are, but what you imagine they can turn into.\"<ref name=\"lacey\" /> To research his role, Spacey met doctors and experts on [[cerebral palsy]] and talked with Singer about how it would fit dramatically in the film. They decided that it would affect only one side of his body.<ref name=\"Burnett\" /> According to Byrne, the cast bonded quickly during rehearsals.<ref name=\"ryan\" /> Del Toro worked with Alan Shaterian to develop Fenster's distinctive, almost unintelligible speech patterns.<ref name=\"hernandez\">{{cite news |last=Hernandez |first=Barbara E |title=What's in a name?

Screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie would feed the actors questions off-camera and they improvised their lines. When Stephen Baldwin gave his answer, he made the other actors break character.<ref name=\"Burnett\" /> Byrne remembers that they were often laughing between takes and \"when they said, 'Action!', we'd barely be able to keep it together.\"<ref name=\"ryan\" /> Spacey also said that the hardest part was not laughing through takes, with Baldwin and Pollak being the worst culprits.<ref name=\"parks\" /> Their goal was to get the usually serious Byrne to crack up.<ref name=\"parks\" /> They spent all morning trying unsuccessfully to film the scene. At lunch, a frustrated Singer angrily scolded the five actors, but, when they resumed, the cast continued to laugh through each take.<ref name=\"Burnett\" /> Byrne remembers, \"Finally, Bryan just used one of the takes where we couldn't stay serious.\"<ref name=\"ryan\" /> Singer and editor John Ottman used a combination of takes and kept the humor in to show the characters bonding with one another.<ref name=\"Burnett\" />\n\nWhile Del Toro told Singer how he was going to portray Fenster, he did not tell his cast members, and in their first scene together none of them understood what Del Toro was saying. Byrne confronted Singer and the director told him that for the lockup scene, \"If you don't understand what he's saying maybe it's time we let the audience know that they don't need to know what he's saying.\"<ref name=\"Burnett\" /> This led to the inclusion of Kevin Pollak's improvised line, \"What did you say?\"\n\nThe stolen emeralds were real [[gemstone]]s on loan for the film.<ref name=\"DVDcom\" />\n\nSinger spent an 18-hour day shooting the underground parking garage robbery.<ref name=\"Burnett\" /> According to Byrne, by the next day Singer still did not have all of the footage that he wanted, and refused to stop filming in spite of the bonding company's threat to shut down the production.<ref name=\"Burnett\" />\n\nIn the scene in which the crew meets Redfoot after the botched drug deal, Redfoot flicks his cigarette at McManus' face. The scene was originally to have Redfoot flick the cigarette at McManus's chest, but the actor missed and hit Baldwin's face by accident. Baldwin's reaction is genuine.<ref name=\"DVDcom\" />\n\nDespite enclosed practical locations and a short shooting schedule, cinematographer [[Newton Thomas Sigel]] \"developed a way of shooting dialogue scenes with a combination of slow, creeping zooms and dolly moves that ended in tight close-ups,\" to add subtle energy to scenes.<ref name=\"williams\">{{cite journal |last=Williams |first=David |date=July 2000 |title=Unusual Suspects |journal=[[American Cinematographer]] |publisher=[[American Society of Cinematographers]] |volume=81 |issue=7 |url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/july00/suspense/index.htm|access-date=July 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203145147/http://www.theasc.com/magazine/july00/suspense/index.htm|archive-date=December 3, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> \"This style combined dolly movement with \"imperceptible zooms\" so that you'd always have a sense of motion in a limited space.\"<ref name=\"gray\">{{cite journal |last=Gray |first=Simon |date=July 2006 |title=Hero Shots |journal=[[American Cinematographer]] |publisher=[[American Society of Cinematographers]] |volume=87 |issue=7 |url=http://www.ascmag.com/magazine_dynamic/July2006/SupermanReturns/page1.php|archive-date=September 4, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904095805/http://www.ascmag.com/magazine_dynamic/July2006/SupermanReturns/page1.php}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2017, amid several sexual misconduct allegations against Spacey, Byrne said that, at one point during shooting, production was shut down for two days because Spacey made unwanted sexual advances toward a younger actor.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ramos |first=Dino-Ray |title=Gabriel Byrne Says Kevin Spacey's \"Inappropriate Sexual Behavior\" Halted Production On 'The Usual Suspects' |url=https://deadline.com/2017/12/gabriel-byrne-kevin-spacey-bryan-singer-harassment-inappropriate-sexual-behavior-1202219958/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=December 4, 2017 |access-date=January 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125015449/http://deadline.com/2017/12/gabriel-byrne-kevin-spacey-bryan-singer-harassment-inappropriate-sexual-behavior-1202219958/ |archive-date=January 25, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Singer, who has himself been accused of sexual misconduct against minors,<ref>{{cite magazine |first1=Alex |last1=French |first2=Maximillian |last2=Potter |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/bryan-singers-accusers-speak-out/580462/ |title=No One Is Going to Believe You |magazine=[[The Atlantic]] |publisher=[[Emerson Collective]] |location=Boston, Massachusetts |date=March 2019 |access-date=May 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224140356/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/bryan-singers-accusers-speak-out/580462/|archive-date=February 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> has denied that Spacey behaved inappropriately on the set of the film, however.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Devan |last=Coggan |url=https://ew.com/movies/2017/12/08/bryan-singer-kevin-spacey-usual-suspects/ |title=Bryan Singer denies that Kevin Spacey's sexual misconduct held up The Usual Suspects|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]] |location=New York City |date=December 8, 2017 |access-date=May 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212151222/http://ew.com/movies/2017/12/08/bryan-singer-kevin-spacey-usual-suspects/|archive-date=December 12, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-production ===\nDuring the editing phase, Singer thought that they had completed the film two weeks early, but woke up one morning and realized that they needed that time to put together a sequence that convinced the audience that Dean Keaton was S\u00f6ze \u2014 and then do the same for Verbal Kint because the film did not have \"the punch that Chris had written so beautifully.\"<ref name=\"Burnett\" /> According to Ottman, he assembled the footage as a montage but it still did not work until he added an overlapping voice-over [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] featuring key dialogue from several characters and had it relate to the images.<ref name=\"Burnett\" /> Early on, executives at [[Gramercy Pictures|Gramercy]] had problems pronouncing the name Keyser S\u00f6ze and were worried that audiences would have the same problem.
