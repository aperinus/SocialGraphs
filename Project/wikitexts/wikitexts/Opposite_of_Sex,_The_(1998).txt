She is pregnant by her ex-boyfriend, Randy Cates. Not revealing her pregnancy, Dedee eventually moves in with her much older half-brother Bill, a [[gay]] teacher in a conservative, [[suburban]] community in [[St. Joseph County, Indiana|Saint Joseph County]], [[Indiana]].\n\nAlthough he is living with Matt, Bill still mourns the loss of his previous partner, Tom, who died of AIDS some time ago. Bill maintains a friendship with Tom's younger sister, Lucia, who idolized her brother.\n\nDedee seduces Matt, then tricks him into believing he has impregnated her. They elope, leaving Bill and Lucia to track them down.\n\nBill and Lucia find Dedee and Matt in [[Los Angeles]], only to discover Dedee has stolen Tom's ashes and is holding them for ransom. Randy also finds her; they inform Matt that they are taking the ashes and moving away. They escape but soon get into an argument that leads to Dedee's accidentally shooting Randy. She and Matt escape to [[Canada]].\n\nLucia and Bill have a falling out after she implies that Tom died as a result of having gay sex. Despondent, she has a one-night stand with Sheriff Carl Tippett, who had previously made unsuccessful romantic overtures to her. Lucia later discovers that she is pregnant.\n\nBill eventually tracks down Matt and Dedee. She goes into labor and Bill accompanies her into the delivery room. After giving birth to her son, Dedee returns Tom's ashes to him, apologizing for her actions in the past year.\n\nDedee ends up serving time in prison, leaving her son in Bill's care while she's incarcerated. After a few months, she moves back in with him, while Matt goes traveling, and Lucia gives birth to her own child. Eventually, Dedee decides that her son would be better off with Bill, who is now dating Dedee's parole officer.\n\nDedee sarcastically concludes that sex is precisely the opposite of what people should want, leading as it does to kids, disease or, worst of all, relationships. At the end of the film, the vignettes of the various caring relationships among the characters show the ''opposite'' of superficial sexual gratification.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Christina Ricci]] as Dedee Truitt\n* [[Ivan Sergei]] as Matt Mateo\n* [[Martin Donovan]] as Bill Truitt\n* [[Lisa Kudrow]] as Lucia De Lury\n* [[Lyle Lovett]] as Carl Tippett\n* [[William Lee Scott]] as Randy Cates\n* [[Johnny Galecki]] as Jason Bock\n* [[Colin Ferguson (actor)|Colin Ferguson]] as Tom De Lury\n* [[Megan Blake]] as Bobette\n* [[Dan Bucatinsky]] as Timothy\n* [[Chauncey Leopardi]] as Joe\n* [[Rodney Eastman]] as Ty\n* Heather Fairfield as Jennifer Oakes\n* [[Leslie Grossman]] as Girl Student\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''The Opposite of Sex'' was shot from June to July 1997 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref name=\"variety\">{{Cite web |last=McCarthy |first=Todd |date=February 9, 1998 |title=The Opposite of Sex |url=https://variety.com/1998/film/reviews/the-opposite-of-sex-1200452928/ |website=Variety}}</ref> It was to be the last theatrical work produced by [[Rysher Entertainment]], who shut down their film unit the same month that shooting wrapped.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hindes |first=Andrew |date=July 9, 1997 |title=Rysher calls 'Cut!' |url=https://variety.com/1997/film/news/rysher-calls-cut-1116677282/ |website=Variety}}</ref> Sony's arthouse division [[Sony Pictures Classics]] distributed the film.<ref name=\"variety\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nFor its North American run, ''The Opposite of Sex'' took in film rentals of $5,881,367.{{Source?|date=October 2022}} The opening weekend saw a per screen average of $20,477 for the 5 theaters showing it.<ref name=numbers/>\n\nJanet Maslin in ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it a \"gleefully acerbic comedy\".<ref name=\":0\" /> Christina Ricci's performance was widely praised and she received a nomination for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Winners & Nominees 1999 - Best Actress - Motion Picture \u2013 Musical/Comedy |url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/winners-nominees/1999 |access-date=2022-10-29 |website=Golden Globes |language=en}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] especially enjoyed the voice-over narration supplied in-character by Ricci, calling it \"refreshing\" and comparing it to ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'':\n<blockquote>\nWhen you've seen enough movies, alas, you can sense the gears laboriously turning, and you know with a sinking heart that there will be no surprises.
