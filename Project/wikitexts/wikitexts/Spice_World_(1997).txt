The film stars [[Pop music|pop]] [[girl group]] the [[Spice Girls]], who all play themselves. The film\u2014made in a similar vein to [[The Beatles]]' ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' (1964)\u2014depicts a series of fictional events leading up to a major concert at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]], liberally interspersed with dream sequences and [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] as well as [[Surrealism|surreal]] moments and humorous asides, along with having an antagonist in the form of an overzealous newspaper editor who starts a smear campaign against the group in an attempt to destroy their reputation for his own benefit.\n\nThis is the second feature-length film directed by Spiers, following ''[[That Darn Cat (1997 film)|That Darn Cat]]'' (1997). The film features [[Richard E. Grant]], [[Claire Rushbrook]], [[Naoko Mori]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Barry Humphries]], and [[Alan Cumming]] in supporting roles, with [[cameo appearance]]s by a number of British celebrities. Filming took place in London for six of the eight filming weeks and also inside [[Twickenham Studios]], as well as at over 40 famous British landmarks. Shooting featured several fourteen-hour shooting sessions and a constant, heavy media presence due to the Spice Girls' then-large popularity.\n\nThe film premiered in the United Kingdom on 15 December 1997, ahead of its wide theatrical release on the British holiday [[Boxing Day]] (26 December). In North America, it was released on 23 January 1998 by [[Columbia Pictures]]. In the United States, ''Spice World'' became a box office success and broke the record for the highest-ever weekend debut for [[Super Bowl]] weekend with box office sales of $10.5 million. The film grossed over $100 million at the worldwide box office. Despite being a box office success, the film received primarily negative reviews.<ref name=telegraph2017/>\n\nTo celebrate its 20th Anniversary in 2017, ''Spice World'' was given a limited release across the United Kingdom showing at Odeon Cinemas. ''Spice World'' is the highest-grossing film of all time by a musical group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/domestic/all-movies/sources/based-on-musical-group |title=All Time Domestic Box Office for Based on Musical Group Movies |publisher=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]] |date=13 July 2020 |access-date=13 July 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins when the [[Spice Girls]] perform their song \"[[Too Much (Spice Girls song)|Too Much]]\" on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. However, they later become dissatisfied with the burdens of fame and fortune. Meanwhile, sinister newspaper owner Kevin McMaxford is trying to ruin the girls' reputation for his ratings. McMaxford dispatches photographer Damien to take pictures and tape recordings of the girls. Less threatening but more annoying is Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth, who, along with his camera crew, stalks the girls, hoping to use them as subjects for his next project. At the same time, the girls' manager, Clifford, is fending off two over-eager Hollywood writers, Martin Barnfield and Graydon, who relentlessly pitch absurd plot ideas for the girls' feature film.\n\nAmid this, the girls must prepare for their live concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in three days, which will be the biggest performance of their music career. At the heart of it, the constant rehearsals, travelling, publicity appearances and other burdens of celebrity affect the girls on a personal level, preventing them from spending much time with their best friend, Nicola, who is due to give birth soon. Throughout the busy schedule, the girls try to ask Clifford for time off to spend with Nicola and relax, but Clifford refuses after talking with the head of the girls' record label, the cryptic and eccentric \"Chief\". The stress and overwork compound, which culminate in the girls' huge argument with Clifford. The girls suddenly storm out on the evening before their gig at the Albert Hall.\n\nThe girls separately think back on their humble beginnings and their struggle to the top. They reunite by chance outside the abandoned caf\u00e9 where they practised during their adolescent years, they reconcile, and decide to take Nicola out dancing. However, Nicola's contractions start at the nightclub and she is rushed to the hospital, where she gives birth to a healthy baby girl. When [[Emma Bunton|Emma]] notices that the delivery \"doctor\" has a camera, the girls realize that he is Damien, who flees with the girls in hot pursuit, only to hit his head after accidentally colliding with an empty stretcher. When Damien sees the girls standing over him, he tells them that they have made him realise he's \"been living a meaningless lie\", and he goes after McMaxford, who is subsequently fired in a \"Jacuzzi scandal\". After noticing the girls' bus driver, Dennis, is missing, [[Victoria Beckham|Victoria]] decides to take the wheel. It becomes a race against time as Victoria drives recklessly through the streets of [[London]] to the Albert Hall. While approaching [[Tower Bridge]], the bridge starts being raised to let a boat through the [[River Thames]]. Victoria drives up the bridge and over the gap. The bus lands safely on the other side, but when Emma opens a trapdoor in the floor, she discovers a bomb, and the girls scream before Emma slams the trapdoor shut again.\n\nThe girls finally arrive at the Albert Hall for their performance. However, the girls have one more obstacle to overcome: a London policeman charges them with \"dangerous driving, criminal damage, flying a bus without a licence, and frightening the pigeons\". Emma is pushed forward and explains to the policeman that she and the other girls were late for their performance at the Albert Hall. Emma smiles at the policeman, and he lets the girls off for their performance. The girls open their Albert Hall concert with their song \"[[Spice Up Your Life]]\", which is broadcast live on global television. The supporting cast later talk about the girls' film during its closing credits. [[Melanie C]] breaks the [[fourth wall]] and tells the other girls that the outgoing audience is watching them. The girls talk to the audience, commenting on \"those two in the back row snogging\" and on one's dress, and discuss about their film, just minutes before the bomb in their bus explodes.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* The [[Spice Girls]]\n** [[Victoria Beckham|Victoria Adams]] (\"Posh Spice\") as Herself\n** [[Mel B|Melanie Brown]] (\"Scary Spice\") as Herself\n** [[Emma Bunton]] (\"Baby Spice\") as Herself\n** [[Melanie C]] (\"Sporty Spice\") as Herself\n** [[Geri Halliwell]] (\"Ginger Spice\") as Herself\n* [[Richard E.
