It follows a trio of high school seniors who must prove their innocence to their vindictive history teacher, who accuses them of cheating on their final exams. Williamson wrote the script before his work on ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' and ''[[Dawson's Creek]].'' Following the success of those projects, his script was picked up and production of the film proceeded.\n\nReleased in the United States on August 20, 1999, the film was originally titled ''Killing Mrs. Tingle'', but was delayed and retitled due to the uproar over teen violence in films after the [[Columbine High School massacre]]. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics and was a [[box-office bomb]]. Williamson has not directed another film since.\n\n==Plot==\nIn Grandsboro, [[California]], Leigh Ann Watson is a [[high school]] student living with her single mother, Faye, who works as a waitress. Leigh Ann's goals are to get top grades, become [[valedictorian]], and leave town. However, her grade in history class is threatened by her teacher, Mrs. Eve Tingle, who has a special dislike for Leigh Ann and downgrades her well-designed project due to a minor historical inaccuracy. Fellow student Luke Churner makes a copy of Tingle's final exam and offers it to Leigh Ann, but she declines. However, Luke stashes the copy in Leigh Ann's backpack. Tingle discovers the copy and threatens to expel her. Tingle immediately heads to Principal Potter's office, but he has left for the day so she decides to tell him in the morning.\n\nLeigh Ann, her best friend Jo Lynn Jordan, and Luke visit Tingle's house that night and try to persuade her that Leigh Ann is innocent. Tingle, however, refuses to listen. Luke threatens Tingle with a loaded [[crossbow]], fellow student Brian Berry's project. A physical struggle ensues, and in the ensuing m\u00eal\u00e9e, Tingle is accidentally knocked unconscious. The trio panic and tie Tingle to her bed. Leigh Ann returns to her house and promises to return in the morning, while Luke and Jo Lynn are left to watch Tingle. While under Jo Lynn's watch, Tingle regains consciousness, and playing on her guilt, asks to be untied. Tingle immediately attacks Jo Lynn, but is restrained again by Luke.\n\nThe next morning, Jo Lynn calls the school and impersonates Tingle, calling in sick. Leigh Ann and Luke go to school, leaving Jo Lynn to watch Tingle. When they return, the trio devise a plan to [[blackmail]] Tingle by using fake photos of Luke and Tingle in bed together. Meanwhile, Tingle plays [[mind games]] with Jo Lynn, concerning her jealousy about Leigh Ann's supposed relationship with Luke. Later that day, the plan goes awry when Coach Richard Wenchell, the school's married gym teacher and Tingle's secret lover, visits the house. Jo Lynn, again, impersonates Tingle and blindfolds Coach Wenchell to hide her identity. When Wenchell passes out after a high intake of alcohol, the trio decide to blackmail Tingle by producing photographic evidence of her affair with Wenchell.\n\nWhile Leigh Ann and Luke leave to have the pictures printed and take an unconscious Wenchell back home, Tingle reveals to Jo Lynn that Leigh Ann and Luke spent the night together at a party. Distraught, Jo Lynn leaves. When Leigh Ann and Luke arrive back, Leigh Ann berates Tingle for hating her because she has, unlike Tingle herself, the potential to leave town and experience life. Tingle retaliates that she used to be like Leigh Ann and that Tingle herself is Leigh Ann's future. In response, Leigh Ann and Luke have sex downstairs. Later, the two find Tingle's grade book. Leigh Ann marks down her rival Trudie Tucker's top A grade down to a B, and upgrades her own C to an A+.\n\nThe next day at school, Jo Lynn ignores Leigh Ann, still hurt over the revelation. Leigh Ann tries to make amends, but admits that she had sex with Luke, further infuriating Jo Lynn. Tingle escapes from her bonds, ties Luke down in her place, and using the loaded crossbow, threatens Leigh Ann. Jo Lynn returns in a failed attempt to persuade Tingle she will help her blackmail Leigh Ann. After a violent fight, Tingle fires the crossbow, hitting Trudie in the chest as she enters the house. Leigh Ann checks her pulse and says she is dead. Potter arrives to check up on Tingle and is horrified by the scene. Guilt-ridden, Tingle confesses that she shot Trudie and wanted to make Leigh Ann fail like Tingle did herself. However, Trudie was protected by the thick textbook she was holding to her chest and is completely unharmed, which Leigh Ann already knew. Potter calls the police and fires Tingle. The film ends with Leigh Ann being named valedictorian at graduation.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as Mrs. Eve Tingle\n* [[Katie Holmes]] as Leigh Ann Watson\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Coach Richard \"Spanky\" Wenchell\n* [[Barry Watson (actor)|Barry Watson]] as Luke Churner\n* [[Marisa Coughlan]] as Jo Lynn Jordan\n* Liz Stauber as Trudie Tucker\n* [[Michael McKean]] as Principal Potter\n* [[Lesley Ann Warren]] as Mrs. Faye Watson (uncredited)\n* [[Molly Ringwald]] as Miss Banks\n* [[Vivica A.
