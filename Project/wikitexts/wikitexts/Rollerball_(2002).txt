A [[remake]] of the [[Rollerball (1975 film)|1975 film of the same name]], based on [[William Harrison (author)|William Harrison]]'s short story ''Roller Ball Murder'', the film stars [[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]], [[Jean Reno]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Rebecca Romijn]] and [[Naveen Andrews]]. Unlike the previous film, it has a much greater focus on action, with more muted social and political overtones than the original, and takes place in the present rather than in a future [[dystopia]]n society.\n\n''Rollerball'' was released on February 8, 2002. Upon its release, the film was critically panned, receiving criticism for the lack of the original's social critique. It was a [[box office bomb]], grossing $25&nbsp;million against a production budget of $70&nbsp;million.\n\n==Plot==\n{{More plot|date=March 2015}}\nIn 2005, the new sport of Rollerball, an extraordinarily violent extension of roller derby involving motorcycles and a metal ball, becomes hugely popular in many countries. Marcus Ridley invites [[National Hockey League|NHL]] hopeful Jonathan Cross to join him playing for the Zhambel Horsemen in [[Kazakhstan]]. The highly paid Marcus and Jonathan are teamed with low-paid locals, who are often severely injured in the game.\n\nIn the beginning, Jonathan, the team's star player and the poster child of promoter Alexi Petrovich, is enamored by the high-octane sport, the popularity, sports cars, and his female teammate Aurora. But Jonathan and Ridley eventually discover that the cynical Alexi and his opportunistic assistant, Sanjay, have a vested interest in keeping the game as popular as possible, through planned gory \"accidents\" and ensuring that Jonathan and Ridley cannot quit the team and remain high-profile stars.\n\nAfter an accident almost kills Aurora, Jonathan and Ridley decide that they need to flee the country to save their lives. The two are followed by Alexi and several bodyguards, who attack the two before they can reach the Russian border. Jonathan is injured and Ridley has to leave him behind. Alexi and his men capture Jonathan and kill Ridley after the latter successfully crosses the border.\n\nFollowing the escape attempt, Alexi tries to stage a public execution of Jonathan by removing all the rules from the upcoming Rollerball match, along with trading Aurora to the opposing team (as requested by Jonathan in an attempt to get her away from danger). However, Jonathan, with the help of his teammates, start a revolution, causing the fans to see the sport for what it really is, and ultimately to kill Alexi.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]] as Jonathan Cross\n* [[Jean Reno]] as Alexi Petrovich\n* [[LL Cool J]] as Marcus Ridley\n* [[Rebecca Romijn]] as Aurora \"The Black Widow\"\n* [[Naveen Andrews]] as Sanjay\n* [[Mike Dopud]] as Michael \"The Assassin\" Uglich\n* [[Andrew Bryniarski]] as Halloran\n* [[Kata Dob\u00f3]] as Katya Dobolakova\n* [[Lucia Rijker]] as Lucia Ryjker\n* [[Oleg Taktarov]] as Oleg \"Denny\" Denekin\n* [[Paul Heyman]] as Sports Announcer\n* [[Janet Wright]] as Coach Olga\n\nThe film features [[cameo appearance]]s by [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], and [[Shane McMahon]].\n\n==Production==\nAlthough the first draft of the script was considered by many to be very good and even superior to the original film, director [[John McTiernan]] didn't like it because it focused more on social commentary, while he thought that the audience would like to see more of the Rollerball scenes. This was why he had the original script completely re-written several times and made sure that it focused more on WWE-like showmanship, including crazy costumes and stunts while changing the film's storyline from a modern-day success story to a classic underdog story and changing the name of the main character in the film from Jonathan E. to Jonathan Cross as well.\n\nThe movie was filmed in about 15 weeks, between July 24 and November 2000. McTiernan's first cut, which was over two hours long, was test screened in Las Vegas around April or May 2001, and got a very negative response from test audiences. The release date was then pushed back from May to July 13, 2001, by MGM to test the movie again, hoping that they would find the right audience for it.\n \n[[Harry Knowles]] from ''[[Ain't it Cool News]]'' was invited by McTiernan for a test screening of the film in Long Island sometime after the first test screening, and in his review of McTiernan's original cut, Knowles said that the movie was bad but at least it was an unapologetic hard-R film with much nudity and some brutal violence in Rollerball scenes, but even as a workprint it was obvious how poorly the action scenes were edited, and the story was bad. \"The 'Rollerball' edit I saw was one of the worst films I'd seen in my life. There was jeering in the theater,\" Knowles said. Knowles was also one of the people who read the original first draft of the script (one that McTiernan rejected) and he said that it was an amazing script which solved all the problems of the original film.\n\nFollowing the negative test screenings, MGM ordered massive re-shoots and re-edits to be done on the film in the middle of 2001. Shortly after the test screenings, MGM appointed a new head of marketing and distribution, Robert Levin, who convinced McTiernan to let go of the summer release date. This would give the studio more time to devise a better marketing strategy and allow McTiernan to do re-shoots and to re-edit the film for a PG-13 rating, in an attempt by the studio to get a wider audience to see the film. The release date was then pushed back again from August all the way to February 2002, due to all the post production work causing delays. McTiernan shot two weeks of additional footage in late 2001 to clarify certain scenes, especially the film's ending, and also cut down the violence and all the nudity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/feb/06/entertainment/et-natale6/2 |title=The Way 'Rollerball' Bounces - Page 2 - Los Angeles Times |website=articles.latimes.com |access-date=15 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013082719/http://articles.latimes.com/2002/feb/06/entertainment/et-natale6/2 |archive-date=13 October 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=June 7, 2001 |author=Harry Knowles |author-link=Harry Knowles |title=ROLLERBALL (2001) test print Review |website=Aint It Cool News |url=http://legacy.aintitcool.com/node/9240 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=February 5, 2002 |title=ROLLERBALL still sucks' |website=Aint It Cool News |url=http://legacy.aintitcool.com/node/11436 }}</ref>\n\nOn orders from the studio, around 30 minutes were cut out of the original rough cut of the film and the entire ending was re-shot and changed.

Some of the other similar edits that were done on more graphic scenes in the film include digitally replacing blood spurts with sweat.\n\nSome of the action scenes were also longer in the original cut and/or edited differently or re-shot, such as the opening scene in San Francisco which was partially re-shot after the original version of it was considered to be too confusing due to the editing.\n\nThe infamous night vision sequence was actually a re-shot version of the scene. After realizing that they shot the original version of the scene to look too dark, filmmakers had to return and re-shoot the entire sequence, delaying the movie's release for six months. Due to the issues with the budget, this scene could not be finished properly, thus it was decided to add green visual tint to the scene to make the scene look like it was shot in night vision, despite the lack of point in giving it that look.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}\n\nThe original score by [[Brian Transeau]] was also removed, purportedly because it sounded \"too Arabic\", and was replaced with a new score by [[\u00c9ric Serra]]. Also, some of the other music was changed or removed from the first cut of the film.<ref>{{cite web |title=The John McTiernan's ROLLERBALL page |url= http://www.conancompletist.com/eatersofthedead/interviews/jason.htm |website=www.conancompletist.com}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Rollerball'' was panned by critics.
