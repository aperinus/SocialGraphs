After&nbsp;smuggling cocaine from Mexico to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], they sell their haul and receive a large sum of money. With the cash stuffed into a plastic tube hidden inside the Stars & Stripes-painted fuel tank of Wyatt's California-style [[chopper (motorcycle)|chopper]], they ride eastward aiming to reach [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, in time for the [[New Orleans Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras]] festival.\n\nDuring their trip, Wyatt and Billy stop to repair a flat tire on Wyatt's bike at a farmstead in Arizona and have a meal with the farmer and his family. Later, Wyatt picks up a [[hippie]] [[Hitchhiking|hitch-hiker]], and he invites them to visit his [[Intentional community|commune]], where they stay for the rest of the day. The notion of \"[[free love]]\" appears to be practiced, with two of the women, Lisa and Sarah, seemingly sharing the affections of the hitch-hiking commune member before turning their attention to Wyatt and Billy. As the bikers leave, the hitch-hiker gives Wyatt some [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] for him to share with \"the right people\".\n\nLater, while riding along with a parade in New Mexico, the pair are arrested for \"parading without a permit\" and thrown in jail. There, they befriend lawyer George Hanson, who has spent the night in jail after overindulging in alcohol. After the mention of having done work for the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] along with other conversation, George helps them get out of jail and decides to travel with Wyatt and Billy to New Orleans. As they camp that night, Wyatt and Billy introduce George to [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. As an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] and a [[square (slang)|\"square\"]], George is reluctant to try it due to his fear of becoming \"[[addiction|hooked]]\" and it [[gateway drug theory|leading to worse drugs]] but quickly relents.\n\nStopping to eat at a small-town Louisiana diner, the trio attracts the attention of the locals. The girls in the restaurant think they are exciting, but the local men and a police officer make denigrating comments and taunts. Wyatt, Billy, and George decide to leave without any fuss. They make camp outside town. In the middle of the night, a group of locals attack the sleeping trio, beating them with clubs. Billy screams and brandishes a knife, and the attackers leave. Wyatt and Billy suffer minor injuries, but George has been bludgeoned to death. Wyatt and Billy wrap George's body in his sleeping bag, gather his belongings, and vow to return the items to his family.\n\nThey continue to New Orleans and find a [[brothel]] George had told them about. Taking prostitutes Karen and Mary with them, Wyatt and Billy wander the parade-filled streets of the Mardi Gras celebration. They end up in a [[French Quarter]] cemetery, where all four ingest the LSD the hitch-hiker had given to Wyatt.\n\nThe next morning, as they are overtaken on a two-lane country road by two local men in an older pickup truck, the passenger in the truck reaches for a shotgun, saying he will scare them. As they pass Billy, the passenger fires, and Billy has a [[Lowsider|lowside crash]]. The truck passes Wyatt who has stopped, and Wyatt rides back to Billy, finding him lying flat on the side of the road and covered in blood. Wyatt tells Billy he's going to get help and covers Billy's wound with his own leather jacket. Wyatt then rides down the road toward the pickup as it makes a U-turn. Passing in the opposite direction, the passenger fires the shotgun again, this time through the driver's-side window. Wyatt's riderless motorcycle flies through the air and comes apart before landing and becoming engulfed in flames.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Peter Fonda]] as Wyatt, \"Captain America\"\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as Billy\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as George Hanson\n* [[Luke Askew]] as Stranger on Highway\n* [[Phil Spector]] as Connection\n* [[Karen Black]] as Karen\n* [[Toni Basil]] as Mary\n* Antonio Mendoza as Jesus\n* Mac Mashourian as Bodyguard\n* [[Warren Finnerty]] as Rancher\n* Tita Colorado as Rancher's Wife\n* [[Luana Anders]] as Lisa\n* [[Sabrina Scharf]] as Sarah\n* [[Robert Walker Jr.]] as Jack\n* Sandy Brown Wyeth as Joanne\n{{div col end}}\n\nAmong those uncredited in the commune scene were [[Bridget Fonda]], [[Dan Haggerty]], and [[Carrie Snodgress]].\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nHopper and Fonda's first collaboration was in ''[[The Trip (1967 film)|The Trip]]'' (1967), written by Jack Nicholson, which had themes and characters similar to those of ''Easy Rider''.<ref name=Mills/> Peter Fonda had become \"an icon of the counterculture\" in ''[[The Wild Angels]]'' (1966), where he established \"a persona he would develop further in ''The Trip'' and ''Easy Rider''.\"<ref name=Laderman2010/> ''The Trip'' also popularized LSD, while ''Easy Rider'' went on to \"celebrate '60s counterculture\" but does so \"stripped of its innocence.\"<ref name=Boyd2009/> Author Katie Mills wrote that ''The Trip'' is a way point along the \"metamorphosis of the rebel road story from a [[Beat Generation|Beat]] relic into its hippie reincarnation as ''Easy Rider''\", and connected Peter Fonda's characters in those two films, along with his character in ''The Wild Angels'', deviating from the \"formulaic biker\" persona and critiquing \"commodity-oriented filmmakers appropriating [[avant-garde film]] techniques.\"<ref name=Mills/> It was also a step in the transition from [[independent film]] into [[Hollywood film|Hollywood]]'s mainstream, and while ''The Trip'' was criticized as a faux, popularized [[underground film]] made by Hollywood insiders, ''Easy Rider'' \"interrogates\" the attitude that underground film must \"remain strictly segregated from Hollywood.\"<ref name=Mills/> Mills also wrote that the famous acid trip scene in ''Easy Rider'' \"clearly derives from their first tentative explorations as filmmakers in ''The Trip''.\"<ref name=Mills/> ''The Trip'' and ''The Wild Angels'' had been low-budget films released by [[American International Pictures]] and were both successful. When Fonda took ''Easy Rider'' to AIP, however, as it was Hopper's first film as director, they wanted to be able to replace him if the film went overbudget, so Fonda took the film to [[Bert Schneider]] of [[Raybert Productions]] and [[Columbia Pictures]] instead.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|date=February 11, 1970|page=6|title='Easy Rider' No Accident; Those AIPix Trailblazed For It|last=Setlowe|first=Rick}}</ref>\n\nWhen seeing a still of himself and [[Bruce Dern]] in ''[[The Wild Angels]]'', Peter Fonda had the idea of a modern [[Western film|Western]], involving two bikers travelling around the country and eventually getting shot by hillbillies. He called Dennis Hopper, and the two decided to turn that into a movie, ''The Loners'', with Hopper directing, Fonda producing, and both starring and writing. They brought in screenwriter [[Terry Southern]], who came up with the title ''Easy Rider''. The film was mostly shot without a screenplay, with [[ad-lib]]bed lines, and production started with only the outline and the names of the protagonists. Keeping the Western theme, Wyatt was named after [[Wyatt Earp]] and Billy after [[Billy the Kid]].<ref name=biskind/> However, Southern disputed that Hopper wrote much of the script. In an interview published in 2016 [Southern died in 1995] he said, \"You know if Den Hopper improvises a dozen lines and six of them survive the cutting room floor he'll put in for screenplay credit. Now it would be almost impossible to exaggerate his contribution to the film\u2014but, by George, he manages to do it every time.\"<ref name=\"Golden\">{{cite web|url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/terry-southern-writing-to-his-own-beat/|title=Terry Southern: Writing to His Own Beat|last=Golden|first=Mike|date=January 12, 2016|publisher=Creative Screenwriting|access-date=January 21, 2016}}</ref> According to Southern, Fonda was under contract to produce a motorcycle film with A.I.P., which Fonda had agreed to allow Hopper to direct. According to Southern, Fonda and Hopper didn't seek screenplay credit until after the first screenings of the film, which required Southern's agreement due to [[Screen Writers Guild|writers guild]] policies. Southern says he agreed out of a sense of camaraderie, and that Hopper later took credit for the entire script.<ref name=\"Golden\"/>\n\nAccording to Terry Southern's biographer, Lee Hill, the part of George Hanson had been written for Southern's friend, actor [[Rip Torn]]. When Torn met with Hopper and Fonda at a New York restaurant in early 1968 to discuss the role, Hopper began ranting about the \"[[redneck]]s\" he had encountered on his scouting trip to the South. Torn, a Texan, took exception to some of Hopper's remarks, and the two almost came to blows, as a result of which Torn withdrew from the project. Torn was replaced by Jack Nicholson, whom Hopper had recently appeared with in ''[[Head (film)|Head]]'' (along with another ''Easy Rider'' co-star, [[Toni Basil]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063049/fullcredits |title=Head (1968) \u2013 Full Cast & Crew |website=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] |access-date=2014-01-13}}</ref> In 1994, [[Jay Leno]] interviewed Hopper about ''Easy Rider ''on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno|The Tonight Show]]'', and during the interview, Hopper falsely claimed that Torn had pulled a knife on him during the altercation when it was actually the other way around. This infuriated Torn, so he sued Hopper for defamation seeking punitive damages. Torn ultimately prevailed against Hopper on all counts.<ref name=biskind/>\n\n===Filming===\nThe filming budget of ''Easy Rider'' was $360,000 to $400,000.<ref name=BudgetCitations/><ref name=Kiselyak/> Peter Fonda said that on top of this, he personally paid for the costs of travel and lodging for the crew, saying, \"Everybody was taking my credit cards and would pay for all the hotels, the food, the gas, everything with Diner's Club\".<ref name=Barra2008/><ref name=Kiselyak/> Laszlo Kovacs said that an additional $1 million, \"about three times the budget for shooting the rest of the film\" was spent licensing music that was added during the editing.<ref name=Fisher2004/>\n\nAccording to Bill Hayward,<ref name=Kiselyak>{{cite news |last1=Kiselyak |first1=Charles |title=Shaking the Cage |publisher=Columbia Tristar Pictures |date=1999}}</ref> the associate producer of the film, in interviews included as part of the bonus DVD feature, Shaking the Cage, Hopper was difficult on set. During test shooting on location in New Orleans, Hopper fought with the production's ad hoc crew for control. At one point he entered into a physical confrontation with photographer [[Barry Feinstein]], who was one of the camera operators for the shoot.<ref name=Kiselyak/> After this turmoil, Hopper and Fonda decided to assemble a proper crew for the rest of the film.<ref name=\"making of\"/>\n\nAllegedly, the characters of Wyatt and Billy were respectively based on [[Roger McGuinn]] and [[David Crosby]] of [[the Byrds]].<ref>Walker, Michael.

Hopper said all the outdoor shooting was an intentional choice on his part, because \"God is a great [[Gaffer (motion picture industry)|gaffer]].\" The production used two five-ton trucks, one for the equipment and one for the [[motorcycle]]s, with the cast and crew in a motor home.<ref name=Fisher2004/> One of the locations was [[Monument Valley]].<ref name=Fisher2004/>\n\nThe restaurant scenes with Fonda, Hopper, and Nicholson were shot in [[Morganza, Louisiana]].<ref name=Fisher2004/> The men and girls in that scene were all Morganza locals.<ref name=Fisher2004/> In order to inspire more vitriolic commentary from the local men, Hopper told them the characters of Billy, Wyatt, and George had raped and killed a girl outside of town.<ref name=\"making of\"/> The scene in which Billy and Wyatt were shot was filmed on [[Louisiana Highway 105]] North, just outside [[Krotz Springs, Louisiana|Krotz Springs]], and the two other men in the scene\u2014Johnny David and D.C.

Although Fonda was reluctant, he eventually complied.

The delay was partially due to a protracted editing process. Inspired by ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]],'' one of Hopper's proposed cuts was 220 minutes long, including extensive use of the \"[[Flashforward|flash-forward]]\" narrative device, wherein scenes from later in the movie are inserted into the current scene.<ref name=Kiselyak/> Only one flash-forward survives in the final edit: when Wyatt in the New Orleans brothel has a premonition of the final scene. At the request of [[Bob Rafelson]] and [[Bert Schneider]], [[Henry Jaglom]] was brought in to edit the film into its current form, while Schneider purchased a trip to Taos for Hopper so he wouldn't interfere with the recut. Upon seeing the final cut, Hopper was originally displeased, saying that his movie was \"turned into a TV show,\" but he eventually accepted, claiming that Jaglom had crafted the film the way Hopper had originally intended. Despite the large part he played in shaping the film, Jaglom only received credit as an \"Editorial Consultant.\"<ref name=biskind/>\n\nIt is unclear what the exact running time of original rough cut of the movie was: four hours, four and a half hours, or five hours.<ref name=Kiselyak/> In 1992 the film's producers, Schneider and Rafelson, sued Columbia Pictures over missing negatives, edit footage and damaged prints holding them negligent concerning these assets.

Also, upon watching a screening of the film with Cambern's edits, the group felt they could not improve on the music that was used.<ref name=Kiselyak/> On the other hand, Hopper increasingly got control over every aspect over the course of the project and decided to throw CSNY out behind Fonda's back, telling the band as an excuse, \"Look, you guys are really good musicians, but honestly, anybody who rides in a limo can't comprehend my movie, so I'm gonna have to say no to this, and if you guys try to get in the studio again, I may have to cause you some bodily harm.\"<ref name=\"UCR\" />\n\nInspired by the movie, Hendrix later wrote a song \"[[Ezy Ryder]]\", with lyrics reflecting the film's themes.\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was released by [[The Criterion Collection]] in November 2010 as part of the box set ''America Lost and Found: The BBS Story''.
