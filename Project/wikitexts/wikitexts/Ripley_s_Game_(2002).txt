It is adapted from the 1974 novel ''[[Ripley's Game]]'', the third in [[Patricia Highsmith]]'s series about the murderous adventures of the [[anti-hero]] [[Tom Ripley]]. [[John Malkovich]] stars as Ripley, opposite [[Dougray Scott]] and [[Ray Winstone]]. It received positive reviews. Highsmith's novel was previously adapted in 1977 as ''[[The American Friend]]'' by director [[Wim Wenders]], starring [[Dennis Hopper]] and [[Bruno Ganz]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Tom Ripley]] is involved in an [[art forgery]] scheme in Berlin, in partnership with British gangster Reeves. Upon finding out that Reeves has attempted to cheat him, Ripley forces Reeves' customer at gunpoint to give him the money intended for the forgeries, and kills the man\u2019s bodyguard. He also steals back the artwork for himself, and curtly tells Reeves that their partnership is over.\n\nThree years later, Ripley is living in a lush villa in [[Veneto]] with his wife Luisa, a [[harpsichord]]ist. Invited by a neighbour to a party, Ripley overhears the host, Jonathan Trevanny, insulting his taste and alluding to his shady reputation. Ripley briefly confronts him, then sullenly leaves the party.\n\nReeves resurfaces, much to Ripley's annoyance, asking him to eliminate a rival mobster. Ripley recommends Trevanny for the job as revenge for the slight. Believing Trevanny, a law-abiding art framer who is dying of [[leukemia]], to be an assassin, Reeves offers him the job for a large fee. A bewildered Trevanny refuses, but eventually agrees to make sure that his wife and son are provided for after his death. Trevanny travels to Berlin under the pretense of seeing a leukemia specialist, and kills the mobster at a museum. He refuses Reeves' offer of even more money to kill another mobster, this time on a train, but relents after Reeves threatens his family.\n\nTrevanny freezes up on the train and contemplates suicide. Ripley intervenes and the two dispatch the target and his two bodyguards in the train's toilet. Together they return home, where Trevanny vainly attempts to persuade his wife Sarah that he won the money playing [[roulette]].\n\nReeves ignores Ripley's warnings to keep a low profile, fearing that the Mafia will seek reprisal for the killing and deduce who was involved. The mobsters' associates come to Italy seeking revenge, killing Reeves and leaving his body in the boot of their car. They storm Ripley's villa, but Ripley has boobytrapped his home. With Trevanny's help, Ripley kills them all.\n\nRipley leaves Trevanny under the assumption that all the killers have been dispatched. However, Trevanny returns home to find two surviving gangsters holding Sarah captive. Ripley spots the killers' car outside in the bushes and doubles back to Trevanny's in time to save his wife. A wounded assassin fires at Ripley, but Trevanny sacrifices himself by jumping in front of the bullet. Puzzled by Trevanny's selflessness, Ripley tries to give Sarah her husband's share of the blood money, but she spits in his face. When he leaves Sarah the packet of money is still on the floor. That night, Ripley attends Luisa's concert as if nothing has happened, but smiles briefly at the memory of Trevanny's sacrifice.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Malkovich]] as [[Tom Ripley]]\n* [[Dougray Scott]] as Jonathan Trevanny\n* [[Ray Winstone]] as Reeves\n* [[Lena Headey]] as Sarah Trevanny\n* [[Chiara Caselli]] as Luisa Harari\n* Sam Blitz as Matthew Trevanny\n* [[Paolo Paoloni]] as Franco\n* Evelina Meghnagi as Maria\n* [[Lutz Winde]] as Ernst\n* Wilfred Xander as Belinsky\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received positive critical reviews, with a 92% \"fresh\" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 24 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ripleys_game/|title=Ripley's Game Movie Reviews, Pictures|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] added ''Ripley's Game'' to his \"Great Movies\" list, calling it \"the best of the four\" Ripley films he had seen (the other three being ''[[Purple Noon]]'', ''[[The American Friend]]'', and ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'') and Malkovich \"precisely the Tom Ripley I imagine when I read the novels,\" praising what he felt to be \"one of [his] most brilliant and insidious performances; a study in evil that teases the delicate line between heartlessness and the faintest glimmers of feeling.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Ebert|author-link=Roger Ebert|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060409/REVIEWS08/604090301|title=The fascinating Mr. Ripley|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=9 April 2006|via=[[RogerEbert.com]]}}</ref> Ebert criticized the decision not to release the film theatrically in [[North America]], writing: \"The failure to open it theatrically was a shameful blunder.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Roger|last=Ebert|author-link=Roger Ebert|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/answer-man/a-talented-mr-ripley-gets-snubbed|title=A talented Mr. Ripley gets snubbed|website=[[RogerEbert.com]]|date=18 April 2004}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, writing: \"John Malkovich, oozing danger and sinister charm, gives one of the year\u2019s most memorable and mesmerizing performances in Ripley\u2019s Game...
