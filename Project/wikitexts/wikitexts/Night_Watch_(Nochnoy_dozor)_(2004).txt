In [[Medieval times]], the armies of both sides met by chance, and a great battle began.  Seeing that neither side had a clear advantage, the two faction leaders, Geser and Zavulon, called a truce and each side commissioned a quasi-[[police]] force to ensure it was kept; the Light side's force was called the Night Watch and the Dark side's force was called the Day Watch.\n\nIn modern-day [[Moscow]], Anton Gorodetsky ({{lang-ru|\u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d \u0413\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439}}) visits a witch named Daria and asks her to cast a spell to return his wife to him, agreeing that she should miscarry her illegitimate child as part of it. Just as the spell is about to be completed, two figures burst in and restrain Daria, preventing her from completing the spell. When they notice that Anton is able to see them, they realize that he is also an Other.\n\nTwelve years later, Anton has enlisted in the Night Watch.  While policing Moscow, he encounters several [[portent (divination)|portent]]s that Geser says are linked to an ancient prophecy of an immensely powerful Other that will end the [[stalemate]] between Light and Dark, but will be more likely to join the Dark.  Anton's investigations lead him to a nurse, Svetlana, whom disaster seems to follow everywhere, and a young boy named Yegor.\n\nIn the film's climax, Anton prevents a catastrophic storm from leveling Moscow, when he realizes that Svetlana is an Other, and begins teaching her to control her power.  But in the process, Anton realizes that Yegor is his own son, and that his wife was pregnant with him when Anton tried to have a spell cast on her (believing, mistakenly, that the father of the child was his wife's lover, not himself).  Learning that his own father tried to kill him before he was born turns Yegor \u2013 the Other of the prophecy \u2013 against Anton and towards Zavulon, which was the latter's plan all along.  In helpless rage, Anton strikes Zavulon, while saying in [[voice over]] that, although the prophecy has come true and the Dark's victory seems inevitable, he will not give up.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=28em}}\n* [[Konstantin Khabensky]] as Anton Gorodetsky\n* [[Vladimir Menshov]] as Geser\n* [[Viktor Verzhbitsky]] as Zavulon\n* [[Mariya Poroshina]] as Svetlana\n* [[Galina Tyunina]] as Olga\n* [[Dmitry Martynov]] as Yegor\n* [[Aleksei Chadov]] as Kostya Saushkin\n* [[Gosha Kutsenko|Yuriy \"Gosha\" Kutsenko]] as Ignat\n* [[Rimma Markova]] as Daria Shultz\n* [[Maria Mironova]] as Yegor's mother\n* [[Valeri Zolotukhin]] as Gennady Saushkin, Kostya's father\n* [[Zhanna Friske]] as Alicia Donnikova\n* [[Nikolay Olyalin]] as inquisitor Maksim\n* [[Ilya Lagutenko]] as Andrei\n* [[Aleksei Maklakov]] as Semyon\n* Aleksander Samoilenko as Ilya\n* [[Anna Slyu]] as Katya\n* Anna Dubrovskaya as Larisa\n* Sergei Prikhodko as Pyotr\n* Georgy Dronov as Tolik\n* [[Igor Savochkin]] as Maksim Ivanovich\n* Nurzhuman Ikhtymbaev as Zoar\n* [[Kirill Kleimyonov]] as himself\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\nIn 2000, an independent Moscow company invited a director from St. Petersburg, Sergei Vinokurov, the script was written by [[Renata Litvinova]]. [[Artemy Troitsky]] was expected to star in the film as Anton Gorodetsky, and for the role of the light magician Geser [[Ivan Okhlobystin]] was chosen. But the work on the film stalled, which was largely in part of the tiny budget of 50 thousand dollars. And then [[Channel One Russia|Channel One]], the government-owned TV channel, bought from the publisher the rights to adapt the novel and invited Timur Bekmambetov to write and direct the film.<ref name=\"kp\">{{cite web|url=https://www.kp.ru/daily/23342/31339/|work=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]|title=\"\u041d\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0440\": \u0422\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432, \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0438 \u0410\u0445\u0435\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0431\u043e\u044f\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044c|author=Anna Veligzhanina}}</ref>\n\nConcerning the casting, Bekmambetov described that he needed an actor for the role of Gorodetsky who was handsome, slightly naive, slightly cunning and that \"his eyes must show that he has a conscience\".<ref name=\"kp\"/>\n\nPart of the challenge for such a big-budget fantasy film was creating hundreds of [[visual effects]] (VFX) [[shot (film)|shot]]s to which a modern audience is accustomed. 16 Russian [[VFX]] studios and several freelancers were used, each chosen for their individual strengths.  Many shots were created by different artists across different [[time zone]]s, using the Internet to share data and images.<ref>{{cite web| author = Alain Bielik| url = http://www.awn.com/articles/production/inight-watchi-cold-hard-vfx-russia|title = ''Night Watch'': Cold Hard VFX from Russia|work = VFXWorld.com|access-date = 2010-09-08|date = 17 February 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe film was the first big-budget [[Russia]]n [[supernatural]] movie and one of the first [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]] made after the collapse of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] film industry.

The track was a top 20 hit single in the United Kingdom charting at #11 in 2005, to coincide with the international release of the film. The song playing during the end credits of the American release of Night Watch is \"Fearless\" by The Bravery.

By 13 February 2006 (i.e. before the U.S. release) it had grossed US$32 million.\n\n[[File:Night Watch poster.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Original English language poster for ''Night Watch'']]\nThe \"international version\" of the film debuted in the [[United Kingdom]]. In the prologue and epilogue, the Russian [[voice-over]] has been [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] in English, but for the rest of the film features stylized [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]] appearing in odd places around the screen, often [[kinetic typography|animated to emphasise or complement the action]].  For example, in a scene in which Yegor is being called by a Dark vampire, he is in a pool and the camera is underwater.  The caption appears as blood red text that dissolves as blood would in water.  In another scene, as a character walks across the scene from left to right, the caption is revealed as his body crosses the screen. In addition, many of the scenes that were present in the Russian theatrical release were omitted, while, at the same time, some scenes were re-cut or added. The International version is shorter by 10 minutes. The [[DVD]] was released in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] on 24 April 2006.  The [[DVD region code|zone 4]] DVD had the option of either a Russian or an English audiotrack.  Subtitles were simply plain white text at the bottom of the screen. The International version of both ''Night Watch'' and its sequel, ''[[Day Watch (film)|Day Watch]]'', are now available in HD on [[Vudu]]. The HDX encodes are based on the International release and retain the original Russian dialog track with the stylized subtitles.\n\nThe original Russian \"Director's Cut\" of the film was released, apart from Russia, in some European countries on DVD by 20th Century FOX. The only difference of this version from the original Russian version is the absence of the opening credits.\n\n===Franchise===\nA third film, titled ''Twilight Watch'' (previously ''Dusk Watch''), was announced by 20th Century Fox, however Timur instead directed ''[[Wanted (2008 film)|Wanted]]'' for Universal Pictures. He went on to say that ''Twilight Watch'' would be too much like ''Wanted'', and so to avoid working in an artistic rut the project would need to be either distinctively changed, passed to another director, or simply delayed so that intervening projects could be completed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bekmambetov's 'Twilight Watch' in Peril, Trilogy Doomed?|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/12664/|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|access-date=23 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==\"Nochnoi Bazar\" fan re-dub==\nIn 2005, a \"fan re-dub\" was released under the title \"Nochnoi Bazar\" (\"Night Chat\"). The project was initiated by the writer [[Sergei Lukyanenko]] as a nod to popular (illegal) fan re-dubs by \"Goblin\" ([[Dmitry Puchkov]]). However, this fan redub was made with full consent of the filmmakers and copyright holders and released on DVD by [[Channel One Russia]]. The script was written by the Russian comedian [[Alexander Bachilo]], the song parodies were written and composed by [[Alexander Pushnoy]]. The narration was done by [[Leonid Volodarskiy]], a popular [[voiceover]] translator of pirated videoreleases in the [[Soviet Union]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Vampire film]]\n*[[List of Russian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n*[[List of submissions to the 77th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{mojo title|nightwatch05}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/movies/05johnson.html?_r=1&oref=slogin The New York Times: ''From Russia, with Blood and Shape-Shifters'']\n\n<!--Split film/book article intentional - Please do not remove this comment-->\n{{World of Watches}}\n{{Russian submission for Academy Awards}}\n{{Timur Bekmambetov}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Night Watch (2004 Film)}}\n[[Category:Night Watch]]\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2000s action thriller films]]\n[[Category:2004 fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Russian action films]]\n[[Category:Russian fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Russian thriller films]]\n[[Category:Russian horror films]]\n[[Category:2000s Russian-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Timur Bekmambetov]]\n[[Category:Films based on fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on Russian novels]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1992]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2004]]\n[[Category:Films set in Moscow]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Moscow]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Laeta Kalogridis]]\n[[Category:Films about shapeshifting]]\n[[Category:2000s supernatural thriller films]]\n[[Category:Vampires in film]]\n[[Category:Fox Searchlight Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Bazelevs Company films]]\n[[Category:Russian dark fantasy films]]"}]}}}}
