However, the [[lemur]] population in the cannibals' stuff attack Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria ([[Cannibalism|cannibals]] attack Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria), and Julien screams: \"Cannibals! Where?!\". When Alex, Marty, Melman, Gloria, Julien and the lemur population inadvertently population who mistake them for the \"Red Night Goblin\" that visits every year at this time, the 24th of ''Julianuary''. Julien tells a [[Incandescence|red glow]], filled by the [[air]] with the [[Santa Claus|red night goblin]]'s horrible and mocking laughter and [[List of rock formations|hundreds of black rocks]] (the red night goblin). Immediately after that, the red night goblin horrible laughs and pelts the island with hundreds of black rocks into Alex, Marty, Melman, Gloria, Julien and the lemur population. Evading the barrage, Alex manages to shoot Santa Claus, the red night goblin. Julien and the lemur population cheers into Madagascar and the falling Santa Claus, the falling red night goblin was kill Julien in the [[explosion]] into the screaming lemur population. The crash has left him with [[amnesia]], unaware of his responsibilities. Julien comments around this time that he has \"another hat on,\" indicating the large bump on his head, unaware of his responsibilities.\n\nThe group resolve to deliver the presents and use the sleigh to get back home, but [[Santa Claus's reindeer|Santa's reindeer]] won't take orders from anyone other than Santa, so the penguins use Santa's magic dust to fly. Their initial attempts to make deliveries go awry so they decide to dump the gifts at the relevant post offices. However, after crashing into an apartment and unintentionally bringing joy to a little girl, they continue with the deliveries despite the adverse conditions.\n\nBack on [[Madagascar]], while the lemurs are presenting gifts to Julien for \"Julianuary\", Santa rediscovers his ability to make toys. He crafts gifts for them all, angering Julien as he feels the focus should be on him. Julien decrees that the lemurs' gifts belong to him. Sifting through the presents alone depresses him; Santa's suggestion of giving a gift lifts his mood.\n\nAs the night nears its end, the animals have only enough magic dust for one last trip. Putting aside their desire to go home, they return to Madagascar to rescue Santa. They run out of dust and crash into him, restoring his memory. He thanks the animals for making his deliveries and takes Julien off the naughty list. However, the animals have overlooked a bag for [[Liechtenstein]], so Santa switches to a reserve tank to make the trip before the animals can ask for a ride. The animals resolve to enjoy their [[Christmas]] in Madagascar, but Julien throws a coconut at Alex to get back on the naughty list, causing a large lump on the lion's head. When his friends ask if he is all right, he asks who's Alex, Mort yells to the viewers, \"Merry Christmas and happy Julianuary, everybody!\", Julien getting chucked in Mort's head with another coconut and the special ends off.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Alex the [[lion]].\n* [[Chris Rock]] as Marty the [[zebra]].\n* [[David Schwimmer]] as Melman the [[giraffe]].\n* [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] as Gloria the [[hippopotamus]].\n* [[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]] as King Julien XIII the [[ring-tailed lemur]].\n* [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]] as Skipper the [[penguin]].\n* [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]] as Kowalski the penguin.\n* [[Christopher Knights]] as Private the penguin.\n* [[Carl Reiner]] as [[Santa Claus]].\n* [[Cedric the Entertainer]] as Maurice the [[aye-aye]].\n* [[Andy Richter]] as Mort the [[mouse lemur]].\n* [[Nina Dobrev]] as Cupid the reindeer.\n* [[Willow Smith]] as Abby.\n* [[Jim Cummings]] as Donner, the lead [[reindeer]].\n\n''Note'': Rico appears, but has no dialogue.\n\n==Awards==\n''Merry Madagascar'' was nominated for six [[Annie Award]]s, and won one award for Storyboarding in a Television Production.<ref>{{cite web|title=37th Annual Annie Nominations and Awards Recipients |url=http://annieawards.org/legacy37th.html |publisher=The Annie Awards |access-date=March 25, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815022604/http://annieawards.org/legacy37th.html |archive-date=August 15, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!
