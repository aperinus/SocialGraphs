Block (aka Larry Block). The film is based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] of the [[Captain America|same name]]. While the film takes several liberties with the comic's storyline, it features Steve Rogers becoming Captain America during [[World War II]] to battle the [[Red Skull]], being frozen in ice, and subsequently being revived to save the President of the United States from a crime family that dislikes his environmentalist policies.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bulletproofaction.com/2018/07/04/bullet-points-captain-america-1990/ |title=Bullet Points: Captain America (1990) |website=BPA |access-date=October 1, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1936 in [[Porto Venere]], Italy, the [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist]] government kidnaps a child prodigy, Tadzio De Santis, and kills his family, to use him for an experimental project to create a Fascist [[supersoldier]]. The procedure's inventor, Dr. Maria Vaselli, objects to this cruelty and defects to the United States to offer her services to the Americans.\n\nSeven years later, the American government finds a volunteer in Steve Rogers, a frail soldier who is excluded from the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] due to being partly crippled by [[Poliomyelitis|polio]]. The formula successfully cures Rogers' ailments and gives him superior strength and endurance; but before any more supersoldiers can be created, Vaselli is murdered by a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] spy secretly working with Lieutenant Fleming before Rogers manages to kill him. Meanwhile, the now adult de Santis\u2014whose skin was burnt to a scarred red texture by the earlier version of Vaselli's procedure, but has physical prowess equal to Rogers\u2014has become the [[Red Skull]], and is planning to launch a prototype [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] at the [[White House]]. Rogers, now code-named [[Captain America]], is sent in to neutralize the Red Skull and the missile. He penetrates the Nazi launch compound, but the Red Skull defeats Captain America and ties him to the missile. As it is about to launch, Captain America grabs the Red Skull's arm and forces him to cut off his own hand to avoid being taken along. While the missile is over Washington, D.C., a young boy named Tom Kimball takes a photograph as Captain America kicks one of the missile's fins, changing its course mere yards from the White House and ultimately crashing somewhere in [[Alaska]], burying itself and Rogers under the ice.\n\nIn 1992, Tom Kimball is elected [[President of the United States]]. A year into his first term, he pushes for aggressive new [[Environmentalism|pro-environmentalist]] legislation that angers the [[Military\u2013industrial complex|military-industrial complex]] headed by now-general Fleming. At a secret conference in Italy, Fleming meets with the Red Skull and other leaders of a global shadow organization. Following the war, the Red Skull had extensive plastic surgery to partially alter his disfigured features, raised a hitwoman daughter, [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Valentina]], and became the leader of a powerful [[crime family]]. In the 1960s, the shadow organization hired the Red Skull and his thugs to murder various Americans who were against militarism and fascism, such as [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]], President [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]], and [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Kennedy]]. This time, the Red Skull disapproves murder and instead organizes Kimball's kidnapping and subsequent brainwashing.\n\nIn Alaska, a team of researchers accidentally find Rogers' body frozen in a block of ice, and he awakens still thinking that it is the 1940s. His mysterious reappearance makes international headlines, alerting both Kimball and the Red Skull. After escaping from some of the Red Skull's thugs, Rogers brushes off Sam Kolawetz, a reporter and childhood friend of Kimball who has long hounded the Skull, and hitchhikes his way back to his wartime girlfriend, Bernice, in [[Redondo Beach, California]]. While Bernice still lives at her old residence, she has long since married and raised her own daughter, Sharon, who gives Rogers a series of history videos to help him catch up. Red Skull's thugs, led by Valentina, break into Bernice's house and kill her during their efforts to find Rogers. While visiting Sharon's father in the hospital, Rogers and Sharon learn from the news that Kimball has been kidnapped, and vow to rescue him from the Red Skull. Rogers and Sharon visit the secret underground base where he gained his superpowers to recover Vaselli's diary and learn the original name of Red Skull. They are ambushed by Red Skull's thugs, who are defeated by Rogers. They travel to Italy and, in the Red Skull's childhood home, locate an old tape recording of the murder of his parents. Sharon gets kidnapped as a distraction to allow Rogers, who dons his costume, to enter the Red Skull's castle.\n\nKimball escapes from his cell, is rescued by Captain America and teams up with him in laying siege to the castle. In the midst of their battle, the Red Skull pulls out a remote trigger for a nuclear bomb, but Rogers uses the recording of the De Santis family's murder to distract him. Just as Red Skull recovers, Captain America uses [[Captain America's shield|his shield]] to send him off a cliff, killing him, and as Valentina prepares to kill Rogers, she is hit from behind by his returning shield. The [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marines]] arrive to save the President and arrest the conspirators involved in the kidnapping. Rogers and Sharon embrace, and a news voiceover announces the passing of Kimball's new environmental pact as agreed upon by dozens of other countries around the world.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matt Salinger]] as [[Captain America|Steve Rogers / Captain America]]<ref>{{cite news|title= Make Mine Marvel: Matt Salinger Interview |work= [[Marvel.com]]|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/1197/make_mine_marvel_matt_salinger_interview|access-date=2011-04-04}}</ref>\n* [[Ronny Cox]] as President Tom Kimball\n** Garrette Ratliffe as Young Tom Kimball\n* [[Scott Paulin]] as [[Red Skull|Tadzio De Santis / Red Skull]]\n** Massimilio Massimi as Young Tadzio De Santis\n* [[Ned Beatty]] as Sam Kolawetz\n** Thomas Beatty as Young Sam Kolawetz\n* [[Darren McGavin]] as General Fleming\n** [[Bill Mumy]] as Young Lieutenant Fleming\n* [[Francesca Neri]] as [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Valentina De Santis]]\n* [[Michael Nouri]] as Lieutenant Colonel Louis\n* Kim Gillingham as [[Bernie Rosenthal|Bernice Stewart]] / [[Sharon Carter|Sharon]]\n* [[Sven Medve\u0161ek]] as Pietro\n* [[Melinda Dillon]] as Mrs. Rogers\n* [[Carla Cassola]] as Dr. Maria Vaselli\n* [[Wayde Preston]] as Jack Cooperman\n\n==Production==\nThe first feature-length production of Captain America for theatrical release had a long and tumultuous production history.

The writer, [[Jeffery Sprouse]], later revealed a script and pieces of concept art that also included [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], [[Baron Zemo]] (unknown, though possibly [[Helmut Zemo|Helmut]]), and [[Bucky Barnes]] as characters, when he was interviewed about the project.
