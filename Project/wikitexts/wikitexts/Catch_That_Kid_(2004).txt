It is a [[remake]] of the Danish film ''[[Klatret\u00f8sen]]'' (2002) and tells the story of three kids who rob a bank to obtain the money to pay for the expensive and experimental surgery needed for the father of one of them when the insurance company and the bank president won't help his wife. The film's working titles were ''Mission Without Permission'' (also the film's UK title as well as part of one of the taglines), ''Catch That Girl'', and ''Catch That Kid!''\n\nThe film was met with negative reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nMadeline Rose \"Maddy\" Phillips ([[Kristen Stewart]]) is a 12-year-old girl who loves to climb, often ascending the nearby water tower. Her father Tom shares her passion, but fell more than 100 feet during a climb years earlier. Tom and his wife Molly ([[Jennifer Beals]]) are afraid Maddy may suffer a similar accident and have forbidden her from climbing. Latent injuries from Tom's fall have recently paralyzed him from the neck down.\n\nThe family hears of an experimental operation which can save him, but insurance will not pay for the operation and the family does not have $250,000 for the treatment. Harderbach Financial's president Donald Brisbane ([[Michael Des Barres]]) refuses to loan the amount, despite Molly being employed by the bank to design a security system. Maddy comes up with a plan to rob the bank for the money with her knowledge of her mother's system.\n\nMaddy steals three [[go-cart]]s from her father's race course and recruits her two friends Gus ([[Max Thieriot]]) a young mechanic, and Austin ([[Corbin Bleu]]) a computer geek and aspiring filmmaker, to help her. To convince them, she separately tells each one she loves him and gives him one half of her friendship necklace.\n\nThey break into Harderbach Financial on the night of a party Brisbane is throwing, bringing along Max, Maddy's infant brother, who she is supposed to be babysitting. Maddy distracts the security guards Ferrell ([[James LeGros|James Le Gross]]) and Gus' older brother Chad ([[Stark Sands]]). Maddy and Gus progress to a room with thousands of security deposit boxes while Austin watches Max and manipulates the cameras and alarms to keep the guards away from them. After a sudden equipment failure with her climbing gear, Maddy is forced to free climb the rest of the way up to the main vault containing hundreds of thousands of dollars. Upon reaching the vault door, she accidentally triggers a timer, then with seconds left, cracks the code (\"Madeline\"), grabs $250,000 from the vault and they flee the room, unintentionally setting off the alarm after forgetting to type the exit code. The trio manages to escape the bank's [[Rottweiler]]s and re-escapes Chad who tasers Ferrell, but then lets them go before accidentally tasering himself.\n\nMolly arrives at the bank and Brisbane accuses her system of being useless and fires a Phillips family friend and bank employee Hartmann ([[John Carroll Lynch]]). Brisbane's guest Francois Nuffaut (Fran\u00e7ios Giroday) apologizes to Molly and redirects the blame onto Brisbane for throwing a party at the bank before the security system was operable.\n\nGus and Austin find out that Maddy played them after seeing each other's necklaces and leave her, but the trio reunites during a police chase and evades them successfully.\n\nMaddy and her friends go to the hospital with the money to pay for the surgery, but Molly realizes who the thieves are (through the amount they stole being equal to that of surgery costs and the climbing gear Maddy left in the vault) and intercepts them. Molly realizes her daughter was only doing what she thought was right for her father and does a cover-up by telling the bank executives that the robbery was an unplanned test she performed as chief of security. As they leave, reporters outside the hospital give the public the full story.\n\nMolly forgives Maddy for her actions, the public and the news studio sympathizes with the Phillips family and donates money for Tom's surgery, Brisbane is fired, and Hartmann is promoted to bank president and gives them the loan.\n\nThree months later, Tom has recovered from the surgery. Maddy, Gus, and Austin continue to argue about who will be a better boyfriend for Maddy.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kristen Stewart]] as Madeline \"Maddy\" Rose Phillips, a young girl who is an expert climber.\n* [[Corbin Bleu]] as Austin, a friend of Maddy who is an expert hacker.\n* [[Max Thieriot]] as Gus, a friend of Maddy who is a mechanical expert.\n* [[Jennifer Beals]] as Molly Phillips, the mother of Maddy who works as security consultant at Harderbach Financial.\n* [[Sam Robards]] as Tom Phillips, the proprietor of a go-kart business whose internal injuries from an earlier climbing activity have left him paralyzed enough to motivate Maddy's bank-robbing plot.\n* [[John Carroll Lynch]] as Al Hartmann, a family friend of the Phillips family and worker at Harderbach Financial.\n* [[James LeGros|James Le Gros]] as Ferrell, a security guard at Harderbach Financial.\n* Grunt Hayden and Shane Avery Scott as Maxwell \"Max\" Phillips, the baby brother of Maddy.\n* [[Michael Des Barres]] as Donald Brisbane, the bank president of Harderbach Financial.\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Gideroy]] as Francois Nuffaut, a guest at Brisbane's banquet at Harderbach Financial.\n* [[Stark Sands]] as Chad, Gus' brother who works as a security guard trainee at Harderbach Financial under Ferrell.\n* [[Christine Estabrook]] as Sharon\n* [[Kevin G.
