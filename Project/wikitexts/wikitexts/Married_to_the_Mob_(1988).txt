It earned positive reviews from critics and earned several accolades; Pfeiffer was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]], and Stockwell was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].\n\n==Plot==\nAngela de Marco is the wife of [[Long Island]] [[American Mafia|mafia]] up-and-comer \"Cucumber\" Frank de Marco, who gets violently dispatched by his [[Crime boss|Don]], Tony \"The Tiger\" Russo, when he is discovered in a compromising situation with the latter's mistress Karen. Angela wants to escape the criminal underworld with her son, but is harassed by Tony who puts the moves on her at Frank's funeral. This clinch earns her the suspicion of [[FBI]] agents Mike Downey and Ed Benitez, who are conducting surveillance, and also of Tony's wife Connie, who repeatedly confronts Angela with accusations of stealing her husband. To further complicate things, Downey is assigned to monitor all of Angela's movements as part of an [[undercover]] surveillance operation, but cannot resist becoming romantically involved with Angela himself. Angela's attempts to break away from the Mob result in comic mayhem and a climactic showdown in a honeymoon suite in [[Miami Beach]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Angela de Marco\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as FBI Agent Mike Downey\n* [[Dean Stockwell]] as Tony \"The Tiger\" Russo\n* [[Mercedes Ruehl]] as Connie Russo\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Frankie \"The Cucumber\" de Marco\n* [[Trey Wilson]] as FBI Regional Director Franklin\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Rose\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as FBI Agent Ed Benitez\n* Paul Lazar as Tommy\n* [[Sister Carol|\"Sister\" Carol East]] as Rita \"Hello Gorgeous\" Harcourt\n* [[Ellen Foley]] as Theresa\n* [[Chris Isaak]] as The Clown \n* [[O-Lan Jones]] as Phyllis\n* [[Nancy Travis]] as Karen Lutnick\n* Frank Gio as Nick \"The Snake\" \n* [[David Johansen]] as \"The Priest\" \n* [[Gary Howard Klar]] as Al \"The Worm\" \n* Warren Miller<!-- limited film career, not the film director --> as Johnny \"King's Roost\" King\n* Anthony J.
