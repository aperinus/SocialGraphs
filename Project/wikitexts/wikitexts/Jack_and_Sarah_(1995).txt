Grant]]) and Sarah ([[Imogen Stubbs]]) are expectant parents, renovating their home for their soon-to-be expanding family. One night, Jack in a panic over getting Sarah to the hospital falls down the stairs and bangs his head. He wakes in hospital to find that Sarah had died after giving birth to their daughter. Grief-stricken, Jack rejects fatherhood, leaving the baby girl in the care of his parents and Sarah's mother ([[Eileen Atkins]]).\n\nDuring this time, Jack relies heavily on drink, and befriends a homeless alcoholic man in a nearby skip.  Knowing Jack needs to get back into his life, Jack's father ([[David Swift (actor)|David Swift]]) decides to introduce Jack to his daughter by placing the child in bed next him as he sleeps off another all-night bender. The three grandparents then wait in Jack's kitchen until he wakes. Initially overcome by the child and feeling sabotaged, Jack bonds with his daughter. He quickly becomes a doting father as he continues to mourn the loss of his wife. In honour of his wife, Jacks names the child Sarah.\n\nFatherhood comes naturally to Jack, but he struggles with balancing raising his daughter, house renovation construction, and with his day-time job. In an odd turn of events, the homeless man from the skip comes to visit and Jack offers him work around the house. William ([[Ian McKellen]]), once sober, proves to be a remarkably efficient babysitter and housekeeper.  William and Sarah's grandparents are often present to help Jack, Jack realises that he needs is a full-time live-in nanny to care for Sarah. Unfortunately, the interview process finds candidates who are cold or detached or just plain strange, much to Jack and the grandparents' dismay.\n\nIn a chance outing at a restaurant with Sarah, Jack encounters the waitress Amy ([[Samantha Mathis]]), an American living in London. Amy instantly takes a shine to Sarah and Sarah to her, and Jack offers her the nanny position on the spot.  Within the week, Amy moves into Jack and Sarah's house and begins her new job caring for Sarah.\n\nAlthough Amy clashes with William and the grandparents, especially Jack's mother, Margaret ([[Judi Dench]]), Jack and Amy gradually grow closer\u2014but Jack's boss has also taken an interest in him.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Richard E.
