It focuses on the relationship that evolves between a former pop music idol (of the fictional band PoP!) and an aspiring writer as they struggle to compose a song for a reigning pop diva.\n\nThe film was released on February 14, 2007, by [[Warner Bros.]] It received mixed to positive reviews from critics, who praised Grant's performance and the musical numbers but found the film simplistic, and grossed $145 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nAlex Fletcher is a washed-up former pop star (from the British group 'PoP!') who seems happy in his \"has-been\" status, performing for 80s-loving fans at reunions and random locations, when his manager tells him Cora Corman, a young megastar, wants him to write a song for her, titled \"A Way Back Into Love\". Alex is reluctant to compose again after two decades, because his strength was always the tune, his ex-partner Colin always wrote the words. However, his caring but professional manager tells him that his music career is completely doomed if he doesn't switch gears\u2014interest in his nostalgia concerts is dwindling.\n\nDuring an unsuccessful attempt to compose the song in collaboration with a \"very hip, very edgy\" lyricist, Alex discovers that the woman who is temporarily watering his plants, Sophie Fisher, has a talent for writing lyrics. Alex, on a 48-hour deadline to write the song, asks her to help him, but she refuses multiple times, to the chagrin of her older sister Rhonda, who happens to be a huge fan of Alex. It's not until Alex composes a lovely song with some of Sophie's lyrics and plays it for her that she realizes they could do it. Over the next few days, they grow closer while writing the words and music together. Sophie reveals she had lost confidence in herself and abandoned writing after a disastrous romance with her English professor Sloan Cates.\n\nBarely meeting the deadline Cora has set for the song's delivery, Alex and Sophie are thrilled when she accepts it; however, at a celebratory dinner with Alex's manager Chris and his wife, Sophie is mortified to encounter Sloan. She confronts him but finds herself tongue-tied in his presence, and Alex's own attempts to defend her result in a scuffle. Nursing their wounds back at Alex's apartment, Alex and Sophie fall into an unplanned romantic encounter.\n\nWhen Cora invites Alex and Sophie to hear her interpretation of \"A Way Back into Love,\" Sophie is horrified by her Indian-vibed, sexually confident interpretation of their earnest song. Alex rushes Sophie out of the room before she can say anything, and tells her he agrees it's awful but says they need to accept it as the cost of doing business. Later at Cora's party, despite Alex's best efforts to block her, Sophie finally tells Cora that she feels the new arrangement clashes with the insecurity expressed in the song's lyrics. Cora says she's still going to perform it her way, but expresses appreciation for Sophie's honesty. Sophie leaves Alex when she gets upset by his willingness to demean his talent and his claim that Sloan was right about her personality.\n\nSophie, intending to start a new life in Florida, reluctantly attends the opening of Cora's new tour at [[Madison Square Garden]], at which Alex and Cora will debut \"Way Back Into Love\". Upon hearing that Alex is singing a new song \"written by Alex Fletcher\", Sophie, believing that Alex is stealing credit for her work; attempts to leave; but however, the song Alex sings is called \"Don't Write Me Off\", his plea for Sophie to give him another chance. A touched Sophie finds Alex backstage and he confesses to having successfully convinced Cora to drop the risqu\u00e9 version of \"A Way Back into Love\" in an attempt to win Sophie back. He and Cora perform the tune as he and Sophie intended it to be sung.\n\nThe end of the movie (an homage to [[VH1]]'s ''[[Pop-Up Video]]'') reveals that the song becomes a hit for Cora and Alex, the film version of Sloan's novel flops with critics and moviegoers (destroying his career), PoP! reunites for their induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], after which their lead singer Colin Thompson (who left the band with some of Alex's songs to start a solo career) winds up having his hip replaced after years of dancing, and Alex and Sophie go on to become successful partners, both in songwriting and romance, with five more new pop hits.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Hugh Grant]] as Alex Fletcher, a New York-based former pop music idol and member of the British band \"Pop!\" (inspired by [[Wham!]]<ref>[https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20011785,00.html \"Music and Lyrics (2007)\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224114804/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20011785,00.html|date=2013-12-24}} ''Entertainment Weekly''.</ref> and [[Duran Duran]]<ref>[http://efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=15590&reviewer=382 \"Music and Lyrics\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208145938/http://efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=15590&reviewer=382|date=2010-02-08}}. eFilmCritic.</ref><ref>{{ASIN|B000M5B6Q0|title=Music and Lyrics [Soundtrack]}}</ref><ref>[http://www.wildaboutmovies.com/movies/MusicAndLyricsMoviePosterTrailerDrewBarrymoreHughGrant.php \"Music And Lyrics\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411072845/http://www.wildaboutmovies.com/movies/MusicAndLyricsMoviePosterTrailerDrewBarrymoreHughGrant.php|date=2010-04-11}}.
