It is a retelling of the Biblical account about [[Jesus Christ|Jesus of Nazareth]], from the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] through to the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]]. Along with the [[ensemble cast]], it is [[Claude Rains]]' final film role. It received five [[Academy Award]] nominations.\n\n==Plot==\n===Part I===\n[[Biblical Magi|Three wise men]] ([[magi]]) follow a brightly shining star from Asia to [[Jerusalem]] in search of a newborn king. They are summoned by King [[Herod the Great]], whose advisers inform him of a [[Messiah]] mentioned in various prophecies. When Herod remembers that the prophecy names nearby [[Bethlehem]] as the child's birthplace, he sends the Magi there to confirm the child's existence{{mdash}}and secretly sends guards to follow them and \"keep [him] informed.\" In Bethlehem, the Magi find a married couple{{mdash}}[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]{{mdash}}laying their [[Nativity of Jesus|newborn son in a manger]]. Mary states that his name is [[Jesus]]. As [[Annunciation to the shepherds|the local shepherds]] watch, the Magi present gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh to the infant. After observing the distant spies' departure, the magi leave as an angel's voice warns Joseph to \"take the child\" and \"flee\".\n\nThe spies inform Herod, who decides to kill the child. He orders [[Massacre of the Innocents|the death of every newborn boy in Bethlehem]], and dies when informed that apparently \"not one is alive\". However, Joseph and Mary have [[Flight into Egypt|escaped into Egypt]] with Jesus; when a messenger informs them and others of Herod's death, they return to their hometown of [[Nazareth]].\n\nA pro-Israel rebellion breaks out in Jerusalem against Herod's son, [[Herod Antipas]], but the conflict is quickly quashed. [[Herodian kingdom|Herod's kingdom]] is divided, [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] is placed under a governor, and Herod becomes of [[Herodian Tetrarchy|tetrarch]] of [[Galilee]] and the [[Jordan River]]. Both he and the Romans are convinced that the Messiah the troubled people cry for is \"someone who will never come\".\n\nMany years later, a prophet named [[John the Baptist]] appears and preaches at the Jordan, baptizing many who come to repent. When a grown Jesus appears to him, John [[Baptism of Jesus|baptizes him]]. Jesus then ascends into the nearby desert mountains, where he finds a cave in which resides a mysterious [[hermit]]{{mdash}}a personification of [[Satan]]. The Dark Hermit [[Temptation of Christ|tempts Jesus three times]], but each temptation is overcome by Jesus, who leaves and continues climbing as John's message echoes in his mind.\n\nHe returns to the valley, where he tells the Baptist that he is returning to Galilee. Four men{{mdash}}[[Judas Iscariot]] and the Galilean fishermen [[Andrew the Apostle|Andrew]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and [[John the Apostle|John]]{{mdash}}ask to go with him; Jesus welcomes them, promising to make them \"[[fishers of men]]\". When they rest under a bridge, he gives parables and other teachings, which attract the attention of a passing young man named [[James the Less|James]]; he asks to join them the next morning, and Jesus welcomes him. The group comes near Jerusalem, and Jesus says that \"there will come a time to enter\". They rest at a home in [[Bethany]] occupied by [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] and his sisters [[Martha of Bethany|Martha]] and [[Mary of Bethany|Mary]]. Lazarus asks Jesus if he could join him, but cannot bring himself to leave all he has; before leaving, Jesus promises Lazarus that he will not forget him.\n\nThe group soon arrives at [[Capernaum]], where they meet James's brother [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], a tax collector whom Jesus soon asks to join them. After some thought, Matthew does so. In the local [[synagogue]], Jesus teaches again, and miraculously [[Healing the paralytic at Capernaum|helps a crippled man to walk again]]. Upon seeing this, many begin to follow Jesus on his journey and gather to listen to his teachings.\n\nMeanwhile, the Jerusalem priests and [[Pharisees]] are troubled by the continuing influence and preaching of the Baptist, while the governor [[Pontius Pilate]] wishes only to maintain peace. Since the Jordan is ruled by Herod, he allows the priests to inform him. When he hears that the Baptist is speaking of a Messiah, Herod sends soldiers to arrest him. [[Simon the Zealot]] informs Jesus and his disciples of the Baptist's arrest; he is welcomed as one.\n\nThe fame of Jesus begins to spread across the land and two more men, named [[Jude the Apostle|Thaddeus]] and [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], join him. In Jerusalem, the priests become suspicious of Jesus and the curing of the cripple, and send a group to Capernaum to investigate\u2014among them the Pharisees [[Nicodemus]] and [[Joseph of Arimathea]]. Herod hears rumors about an army due to the multitudes that follow Jesus, and questions John the Baptist about him. Herod begins to consider killing the Baptist, with [[Herodias|his wife's]] encouragement\u2014she herself is the ex-wife of Herod's brother, and has been attacked by John for being adulterous.\n\nJesus is soon asked to return to Capernaum by another man named [[James, son of Zebedee|James]]. Crowds gather and celebrate his return, something that is noticed by the Pharisees who are present and the returned Dark Hermit. Jesus then defends [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|a woman caught in the act of adultery]], who identifies herself as \"[[Mary Magdalene|Mary of Magdalene]]\". Among the crowd that gathers as he moves away is [[Jesus healing the bleeding woman|a sick woman who is cured when she touches his clothes]]. Both of these instances cause many to have faith in Jesus.\n\nHerod begins to wonder about Jesus, and the Baptist confirms that Jesus has escaped from the massacre ordered by Herod's father. Herod then decides to finally [[Beheading of John the Baptist|kill the Baptist]] by beheading, which occurs while [[Salome]], Herod's stepdaughter by his wife's first marriage, dances for him. When the Baptist is dead, Herod sends soldiers to arrest Jesus.\n\nJesus gives a [[Sermon on the Mount|sermon on a mountain to a great crowd]], while Pilate and the Pharisees hear of many of Jesus's miracles: [[Marriage at Cana|turning water into wine]], [[Feeding the multitude|feeding five thousand people]], and [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]]. While resting, Jesus asks his disciples who they and others say that he is: they give many answers, and [[Confession of Peter|Peter believes that Jesus is the Messiah]], prompting Jesus to anoint him as \"the rock on which [he] will build [his] church\".\n\nAt Nazareth, the people [[Hometown rejection of Jesus|refuse to believe in Jesus and his miracles]] and demand to see for themselves by bringing a blind man named Aram and demanding that Jesus make him see. When he does not, the people are disgusted when he calls himself the Son of God, and briefly stone him. Jesus reunites with his mother, along with a sick Lazarus and his sisters. Andrew and [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Nathaniel]] escort Lazarus home to Bethany, while Jesus and the others flee from Herod's approaching soldiers, but not before Jesus heals Aram's sight. When informed that Lazarus is dying, Jesus does not go immediately to Bethany, but to the Jordan where the group [[The Lord's Prayer|gives a prayer]]. Andrew and Nathaniel return, informing them that Lazarus has died, and Jesus then goes to Bethany where he [[Resurrection of Lazarus|brings Lazarus back to life]], a miracle that amazes the witnessing Jerusalem citizens, but concerns the Pharisees. An intermission/entr'acte follows Part I.\n\n===Part II===\nJudas questions why Mary Magdalene is [[Anointing of Jesus|anointing Jesus with expensive oil]], and Jesus states she is preparing him for his death. Jesus then dons a new garment, and [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|rides on a donkey into Jerusalem]]. In the courtyard of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], Jesus [[Cleansing of the Temple|drives the merchants and money changers away]], and the large crowd prevents the Pharisees from arresting Jesus, an action ordered even though it is [[Passover]]. He teaches in the Temple courtyard, and leaves when Pilate dispatches soldiers to restore peace and close the gates. Many of the Temple's crowd are killed as a result.\n\nWhile the disciples gather to prepare and partake in [[Last Supper|an evening meal]], Judas leaves and promises to hand Jesus over to the Pharisees on the condition that no harm comes to him. The Dark Hermit's presence indicates approaching danger. When Judas returns to the meal, Jesus announces to all that [[Jesus predicts his betrayal|one of them will betray him]], that by morning [[Denial of Peter|Peter will deny three times that he even knows Jesus]], and gives a [[Farewell Discourse|farewell discourse]]. Jesus then gives [[Origin of the Eucharist|bread and wine]] to the disciples, and tells Judas before he leaves again to \"do quickly what [he has] to do\".\n\n[[Agony in the Garden|Jesus then prays at Gethsemane]] while Judas is paid [[thirty pieces of silver]] to lead soldiers to [[Arrest of Jesus|arrest Jesus]]. When they arrive, [[Kiss of Judas|Judas kisses Jesus]], and Jesus orders Peter to \"put back [his] sword\". Jesus is [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|put on trial before the Sanhedrin]], and Aram appears as one of the questioned witnesses. Most of the members are present, as Nicodemus{{mdash}}who refuses to take part{{mdash}}notices that many (including Joseph of Arimathea) are absent. Meanwhile, the Hermit is outside and asks the nearby Peter if he knows Jesus. Peter denies it twice and leaves. When [[Caiaphas]] asks Jesus if he is the Christ, Jesus's reply causes the members to condemn him.\n\nThe Pharisees and Caiaphas [[Pilate's court|bring Jesus to the tired Pilate]], who after questioning Jesus{{mdash}}and briefly speaking with [[Pontius Pilate's wife|his wife]]{{mdash}}finds no guilt in Jesus. Since Galilee is under Herod's authority, [[Jesus at Herod's court|Jesus is sent to Herod]], though he and his soldiers merely [[Mocking of Jesus|ridicule him]] and send him back to Pilate. As Jesus is escorted back to Pilate, the Hermit continues to observe, and Peter once again denies Jesus, as a remorseful Judas looks on.\n\nIn the morning, [[Ecce homo|Pilate presents Jesus before the assembled crowd]], and the Hermit begins various cries for Jesus to be [[Crucifixion|crucified]]. Pilate offers compromises: that Jesus merely be scourged, and then the release of a prisoner of the crowd's choice. They choose the supposed murderer [[Barabbas]] instead. Pilate then asks Jesus if he has anything to say; Jesus merely states that his kingdom is \"not of this world\", something that the Hermit and others claim is a challenge of the authority of Rome and the Roman emperor. With no other choice, Pilate reluctantly orders Jesus to be crucified.\n\nJesus then [[Christ Carrying the Cross|carries his cross]] [[Via Dolorosa|through Jerusalem]] while the crowd looks on. When he collapses, [[Saint Veronica|a woman wipes his face]] and he reassures the women of Jerusalem. Soon, the soldiers force a man named [[Simon of Cyrene]] to help Jesus carry the cross when no one else will. At [[Golgotha]], Jesus is stripped and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|nailed to the cross]], which is then raised between those of two other men while Judas throws his silver into the Temple and throws himself into the fire of the nearby altar. He asks God to \"forgive them, for they know not what they do\", and leaves his mother in the care of John. While one of the thieves asks Jesus to save them, the other accepts his punishment and asks for Jesus to remember him, a promise that Jesus gives to him. As the sky darkens, Jesus asks why God has forsaken him, is offered wine in a sponge, and dies before a storm emerges. As an earthquake begins, a centurion states that \"truly this man was the Son of God\".\n\nPeter mourns Jesus while he is being laid to rest in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea. The Pharisees ask for Pilate to place guards around the tomb and seal it, to prevent a possible theft of the corpse that could potentially fulfill a prophecy of [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]; Pilate agrees, but on the morning of the third day the guards discover the tomb is open and empty. Meanwhile, though Thomas has weakened faith, Mary Magdalene{{mdash}}along with Peter and others{{mdash}}recall the prophecy and run to see the empty tomb. Word quickly spreads throughout Jerusalem, the miraculous event bewildering the Pharisees. Caiaphas claims that \"the whole thing will be forgotten in a week\", while an elder scribe doubts this.\n\n[[Ascension of Jesus|Jesus ascends to heaven]] before his disciples, Mary Magdalene, Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathea, and others, leaving them with his final commands as clouds engulf him. He then states that he will always be with them, \"even unto the end of the world\", and his image fades into that of a  painting of him on the wall of a church as [[Georg Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s [[Messiah Part II|\"Hallelujah Chorus]]\" plays.\n\n==Cast==\nThe major roles in the movie are these:\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as [[Jesus]]\n* [[Dorothy McGuire]] as [[Mary mother of Jesus|the Virgin Mary]]\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as [[John the Baptist]]\n* [[Claude Rains]] as [[Herod the Great]]\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] as [[Herod Antipas]]\n* [[Telly Savalas]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* [[Martin Landau]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n* [[David McCallum]] as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as \"The Dark Hermit\" (a personification of [[Satan]])\n* [[Michael Anderson Jr.]] as [[James the Less]]\n* [[Roddy McDowall]] as [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]]\n* [[Joanna Dunham]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n* [[Joseph Schildkraut]] as [[Nicodemus]]\n* [[Ed Wynn]] as \"Old Aram\"\n\nSmaller credited roles (some only a few seconds) were played by [[Michael Ansara]], [[Carroll Baker]], [[Ina Balin]], [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]], [[Pat Boone]], [[Victor Buono]], [[John Considine (actor)|John Considine]], [[Richard Conte]], [[John Crawford (actor)|John Crawford]], [[Cyril Delevanti]], [[Jamie Farr]], [[David Hedison]], [[Van Heflin]], [[Russell Johnson]], [[Angela Lansbury]], [[Mark Lenard]], [[Robert Loggia]], [[John Lupton]], [[Janet Margolin]], [[Sal Mineo]], [[Nehemiah Persoff]], [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Gary Raymond]], [[Marian Seldes]], [[David Sheiner]], [[Abraham Sofaer]], [[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]], [[Michael Tolan]], [[John Wayne]], and [[Shelley Winters]]. [[Richard Bakalyan]] and [[Marc Cavell (actor)|Marc Cavell]], in uncredited roles, played the thieves crucified with Jesus.\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\n''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' originated as a U.S. radio series in 1947, half-hour episodes inspired by [[gospel|the Gospel]]s, written by [[Henry Denker]]. The series was adapted into a 1949 novel by [[Fulton Oursler]], a senior editor at ''[[Reader's Digest]]''.<ref name=\"HHS\">Medved, Harry & Michael. ''The Hollywood Hall of Shame.''

Stevens commissioned French artist [[Andr\u00e9 Girard (1901-1968)|Andr\u00e9 Girard]] to prepare 352 oil paintings of Biblical scenes to use as storyboards.

Stevens was given two years to find another studio or 20th Century Fox would reclaim its rights. Stevens moved the film to [[United Artists]].<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, [[MGM]] proceeded with its own 1961 Technicolor epic about the life of Christ, ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'', starring [[Jeffrey Hunter]] as Jesus, which was filmed in Spain, and is nearly an hour shorter than ''The Greatest Story Ever Told''.\n\n===Casting===\nFor ''The Greatest Story Ever Told'', Stevens cast Swedish actor Max von Sydow as Jesus. Von Sydow had never appeared in an English-language film and was best known for his performances in [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s dramatic films.<ref>Walker, John. ''Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies.''

Some critics would later complain that the large cast distracted from the solemnity, notably in the appearance of John Wayne as the Roman [[centurion]] who comments on the Crucifixion, in his well-known voice, by stating: \"Truly this man was the Son of God.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=12795&mainArticleId=202389|title=The Greatest Story Ever Told|work=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref><ref>\"It is impossible for those watching the film to avoid the merry game of 'Spot the Star', and the road to Calvary in particular comes to resemble the Hollywood Boulevard 'Walk of Fame'.\" ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 137</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nStevens shot ''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' in the U.S. southwest, in Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah.

Cinematographer [[William C.

Joanna Dunham became pregnant, which required costume redesigns and carefully chosen camera angles.<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nMuch of the production was shot during the winter of 1962\u20131963, when Arizona had heavy snow. Actor [[David Sheiner]], who played James the Elder, quipped in an interview about the snowdrifts: \"I thought we were shooting ''[[Nanook of the North]]''.\"<ref>\"Several hundred volunteers . . braved the elements with shovels, wheelbarrows, bulldozers, and fifty butane flame throwers to remove the snow from the expensive replica of the Holy Land.\" ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 140</ref> Stevens was also under pressure to hurry the John the Baptist sequence, which was shot at the Glen Canyon area which was scheduled to become [[Lake Powell]] with the completion of the [[Glen Canyon Dam]], and the production held up the project.<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nStevens brought in two veteran filmmakers.
