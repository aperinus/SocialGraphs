The screenplay, by Australian singer-screenwriter [[Nick Cave]], is based on [[Matt Bondurant]]'s historical novel ''[[The Wettest County in the World]]'' (2008). The film stars [[Shia LaBeouf]], [[Tom Hardy]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Mia Wasikowska]], [[Jessica Chastain]], [[Jason Clarke (actor)|Jason Clarke]], and [[Guy Pearce]].\n\nThe film is about the violent conflict between three [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] brothers: Forrest (Hardy), Howard (Clarke), and Jack Bondurant (LaBeouf) \u2014 and the ruthless lawman Charley Rakes (Pearce), who tries to shut down the brothers' [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]-era [[moonshine]] business after Forrest refuses to pay him off. The film was in development for about three years before being produced. It screened at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]] and was theatrically released on August 29, 2012.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn 1931, the Bondurant brothers \u2014 middle brother Forrest, eldest brother Howard, and youngest brother Jack \u2014 are running a successful [[moonshine]] business in [[Franklin County, Virginia|Franklin County]], [[Virginia]]. The brothers use their gas station and restaurant as a [[front organization|front]] for dealing with the assistance of Cricket, Jack's mechanically gifted friend who builds and maintains their [[still]]s. Jack witnesses rum-runner Floyd Banner shoot dead two [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives#History|federal]] agents in broad daylight for trying to arrest him.\n\nForrest hires Maggie, a financially struggling dancer, as a waitress. Shortly afterward, the gas station is visited by newly appointed [[U.S. Marshal]] Charley Rakes, accompanied by the sheriff and corrupt [[Commonwealth's Attorney|state's attorney]] Mason Wardell. Rakes demands that he and Wardell receive a cut of profits from all bootleggers within the county, including Forrest, in exchange for ignoring their operations. Forrest refuses and implores his fellow bootleggers to unite against Rakes, but they refuse.\n\nMeanwhile, Jack lusts after Bertha, daughter of the local [[Schwarzenau Brethren|Brethren]] preacher. He attends their church service drunk, embarrassing himself but piquing her interest. Jack walks in on a visit from Rakes to Cricket's house and is beaten by him as a message to his brothers. Later that night, Forrest throws out two drunk customers who had been harassing and threatening Maggie. After Maggie leaves, Forrest is ambushed by the two men, who slit his throat. Maggie returns looking for Forrest but is beaten and [[rape]]d by the men. She hides the assault from Forrest, not wanting him to take revenge.\n\nWhile Forrest recovers at a hospital, Jack, deciding to retire from bootlegging rather than cross Rakes any further, crosses the county line with Cricket to sell their remaining liquor. They get ambushed by Banner and his crew but are spared when Jack reveals he is a Bondurant, whom Banner admires for their stance against Rakes. Banner reveals to Jack the address of his brother's assailants, revealing that both men are former bootleggers now working as deputy marshals for Rakes.\n\nForrest and Howard find, torture, and kill the men and send one of their testicles to Rakes. Banner becomes a regular client of the brothers, who invest their profits into setting up larger stills deep in the woods. Jack continues to court Bertha. Maggie decides to return to [[Chicago]], but Forrest convinces her to stay and provides her with a spare room; they soon develop a romantic relationship. On a day trip, Jack decides to show Bertha the brothers' secret operation, but they are followed and ambushed by Rakes and his officers. Howard and Jack flee but Cricket and Bertha are caught. The police take Bertha home, while Cricket has his neck snapped by Rakes.\n\nAfter Cricket's funeral, the sheriff warns the Bondurants that Rakes has set up a blockade at the bridge to trap them while Wardell arranges for [[Bureau of Prohibition|Prohibition]] agents to round up every bootlegger in the county. Jack speeds off in Cricket's car to confront Rakes. Howard and Forrest quickly follow to provide backup, to Maggie's chagrin. She reveals she had delivered him to the hospital after the attack and Forrest realizes that she had been raped.\n\nJack arrives at the bridge but is wounded by Rakes. Howard and Forrest arrive, and a shootout ensues, during which Forrest and his driver are also wounded, the latter fatally. A convoy of bootleggers arrive and hold the lawmen at gunpoint. Rakes ignores them and attempts to execute Forrest but is shot in the leg by the sheriff in an attempt to halt the bloodshed. Rakes turns to leave the scene, but suddenly turns around and shoots Forrest several times. The convoy opens fire on Rakes, but he runs into a covered bridge. Since he is unable to run far, the badly wounded Jack and Howard follow and plunge a knife into Rakes' back, killing him.\n\nFollowing the end of Prohibition in 1933, Wardell is arrested on corruption charges while the Bondurants are all married \u2014 Jack to Bertha, Forrest to Maggie, and Howard to a [[Martinsville, Virginia|Martinsville]] woman \u2014 and working in legitimate occupations. During a festive reunion at Jack's house sometime later, Forrest drunkenly ambles to a frozen lake and falls into the freezing water. Although he drags himself out, he later dies of [[pneumonia]], putting to rest the legend of his invincibility.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Lawless Cannes 2012.jpg|thumb|right|260px|From left: Pearce, DeHaan, Wasikowska, Clarke, Cave, Hillcoat, Hardy, Chastain, and LaBeouf at the film's 2012 Cannes Film Festival screening]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as Jack Bondurant\n* [[Tom Hardy]] as Forrest Bondurant\n* [[Jason Clarke (actor)|Jason Clarke]] as Howard Bondurant\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as Maggie Beauford\n* [[Guy Pearce]] as Special Deputy Charlie Rakes\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as Floyd Banner\n* [[Mia Wasikowska]] as Bertha Minnix\n* [[Dane DeHaan]] as Cricket Pate\n* [[Chris McGarry]] as Danny\n* Tim Tolin as Mason Wardell\n* [[Lew Temple]] as Deputy Henry Abshire\n* Marcus Hester as Deputy Jeff Richards\n* [[Bill Camp]] as Sheriff Hodges\n* Alex Van as Tizwell Minnix\n* [[Noah Taylor]] as \"Gummy\" Walsh\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nWriter [[Matt Bondurant]] wrote the historical novel ''[[The Wettest County in the World]]'' (2008), based on the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]-era [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] activities of his grandfather Jack Bondurant and grand-uncles Forrest and Howard.
