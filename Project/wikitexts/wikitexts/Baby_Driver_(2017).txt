It stars [[Ansel Elgort]] as a [[getaway driver]] seeking freedom from a life of crime with his girlfriend Debora ([[Lily James]]). [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Jon Hamm]], [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Jamie Foxx]], and [[Jon Bernthal]] appear in supporting roles. [[Eric Fellner]] and his [[Working Title Films]] partner [[Tim Bevan]] produced ''Baby Driver'' in association with [[Big Talk Productions]]' [[Nira Park]]. [[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group#Sony Pictures Releasing|Sony]] and [[TriStar Pictures]] handled commercial distribution of the film. ''Baby Driver'' was financed through a co-production pact between TriStar and [[MRC (company)|MRC]] and tax subsidies from the Georgia state government.\n\nWright developed ''Baby Driver'' for over two decades. He devised the idea while in his youth, and his early directing experience further shaped his ambitions for ''Baby Driver''. Originally based in [[Los Angeles]], Wright revised the film's setting to [[Atlanta]], integrating the city's ethos into an important storytelling device. [[Principal photography]] took place in Atlanta over four months, from February to May 2016. Production involved the planning of meticulously coordinated stunts, choreography, and [[in-camera editing|in-camera]] shooting. Critics have examined ''Baby Driver''{{'s}} subject matter in thematic studies of the film, with emphasis on its use of [[color symbolism]] and focus on Baby's evolving morality.\n\n''Baby Driver'' premiered at the [[South by Southwest]] festival on March 11, 2017, and was released in North America and the United Kingdom on June 28. It was well received by the media for its craftsmanship and style, though the characterization and screenwriting drew occasional criticism. The [[National Board of Review]] selected ''Baby Driver'' as one of the top films of the year. It earned $226&nbsp;million globally, bolstered by positive word-of-mouth support and flagging interest in [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] franchises. ''Baby Driver'' was nominated for [[List of accolades received by Baby Driver|numerous awards]], including three [[Academy Awards]], two [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Film Awards]] (with a win for [[BAFTA Award for Best Editing|Editing]]), two [[Critics' Choice Awards]] (again, with a win for [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Editing|Editing]]), and a [[Golden Globe Award]], and won several other honors, chiefly for technical achievement. The success of ''Baby Driver'' has increased studio interest in producing a sequel.\n\n==Plot==\nBaby is a [[getaway driver]] in [[Atlanta]]. As a child he survived a car crash, which killed his parents and left him with [[tinnitus]]. He finds [[catharsis]] in music, typically using [[iPod]]s to soothe his tinnitus. Baby ferries crews of robbers assembled by criminal mastermind Doc as recompense for the theft of a car containing Doc's stolen goods. Between jobs, he remixes snippets of conversations he records and cares for his deaf foster father, Joseph. He meets a [[Waiting staff|waitress]] named Debora, and they start dating. Baby's next robbery goes awry after an armed bystander chases them down, but Baby evades him and the police. Having paid his debt, Baby quits his life of crime and starts delivering pizzas. Doc interrupts Baby's date with Debora and insists he join a post office heist, threatening to hurt Debora and Joseph should he refuse.\n\nThe crew consists of easygoing Buddy, his sharpshooter wife Darling, and trigger-happy Bats, who takes an immediate dislike to Baby. When the crew attempts to purchase illegal firearms, Bats recognizes one of the dealers as a [[covert operative]] and opens fire. They kill most of the dealers. Afterward, Bats makes Baby stop at Debora's diner, unaware of their romance. Baby, aware of Bats's homicidal habit, stops him from killing her to avoid paying. Doc is furious, revealing that the dealers were [[dirty cops]] on his payroll. He decides to cancel the heist, but the crew overrule him. Baby attempts to slip away late that night, hoping to take Debora and leave Atlanta, but he is stopped by Buddy and Bats, who have discovered his recordings and believe he is an informant. Baby convinces them and Doc of his innocence by playing them a tape of one of his remixes.\n\nDuring the heist, Bats kills a security guard. Disgusted, Baby refuses to drive away, causing Bats to hit him. Baby rams the car into some [[rebar]] that impales Bats, killing him; Baby, Buddy, and Darling flee on foot. When Darling is killed in a shootout with police, Buddy blames Baby for her death and vows to kill him. Baby steals a car and flees to his apartment. After leaving Joseph at an assisted living home with his heist earnings, he rushes to get Debora at the diner, where he finds Buddy waiting for him. Baby shoots Buddy and flees with Debora as police swarm the restaurant. Back at the safe house, Doc initially refuses to let Baby take back one of his tapes, even though it only contains his mother singing, but relents when Debora arrives to console Baby. Doc supplies the couple with cash and an escape route out of the country, saying he was also in love once.\n\nThe police who survived the arms deal confront Baby, Debora, and Doc in the parking garage, and Doc kills them all. Buddy then arrives and kills Doc, and a cat-and-mouse game ensues until Buddy has Baby at his mercy. He fires a gun next to each of Baby's ears, temporarily deafening him, before Debora hits Buddy with a crowbar. Baby shoots Buddy in the leg and Buddy falls to his death. Debora flees the scene with Baby. The next day, Debora and Baby encounter a police roadblock, and Baby decides to surrender. At his trial, Joseph, Debora, and other people affected by his crimes testify in his defense, citing his acts of compassion and mercy. He is sentenced to 25 years in prison, subject to a parole hearing after five years. Debora stays in contact with Baby during his incarceration, and he reveals that his real name is Miles. She greets him outside the prison gates on the day of his release in a vintage car.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n | align        = right\n | direction    = horizontal\n | footer       = Ansel Elgort (left) and Lily James (right) at the ''Baby Driver'' Sydney premiere\n | footer_align = left\n | image1       = Ansel Elgort (35875410045) (colour edited).jpg\n | alt1         = A head-and-shoulder shot of Ansel Elgort at the ''Baby Driver'' Sydney premiere\n | width1       = 150\n | image2       = Lilly James (35036323024).jpg\n | alt2         = A head-and-shoulder shot of Lily James at the ''Baby Driver'' Sydney premiere\n | width2       = 150\n}}\n* [[Ansel Elgort]] as Miles 'Baby':<br />An on-call criminal [[getaway driver]] with an intense passion for music.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/baby-driver-character-descriptions-jon-bernthal-edgar-wright/ |title='Baby Driver' Character Descriptions Revealed; Jon Bernthal Joins Edgar Wright's New Film |first=Matt |last=Goldberg |date=February 23, 2016 |website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |language=en-US|access-date=January 15, 2017|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311133204/http://collider.com/baby-driver-character-descriptions-jon-bernthal-edgar-wright/ |archive-date=March 11, 2017}}</ref> Elgort regarded the character as an innocent \"younger than his years, deep down\".<ref name=variety>{{cite news |title=Ansel Elgort on 'Baby Driver,' Directing Ambitions and Life Under Trump |date=June 22, 2017 |first=Brent |last=Lang |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/ansel-elgort-baby-driver-donald-trump-1202470955/ |access-date=October 6, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181207103026/https://variety.com/2017/film/news/ansel-elgort-baby-driver-donald-trump-1202470955/ | archive-date = December 7, 2018 | url-status = live |df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Edgar Wright]] and the producers at [[Working Title Films]] began contemplating the lead role well before they obtained funding for ''Baby Driver''.

admits his music video was a significant undertaking because it provided [[proof of concept]] for ''Baby Driver''.<ref name=\"Bdguardian2\" /> The release of Wright's first major feature, ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' (2004), was another important catalyst, not only for its artistic direction, but also for signaling the start of a long-term working relationship between Wright and Working Title producers, who would assist with ''Baby Driver''{{'}}s development.<ref name=\"Entcast\" /> By 2007, after signing a multi-picture deal with Working Title, and with a clearer vision of the project, Wright met with [[Steven Price (composer)|Steven Price]] to discuss early musical ideas for ''Baby Driver''.<ref name=\"Entcast\" /> The drafting of a story started around the release of ''[[Scott

(film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015), for which he had already prepared a script with [[Joe Cornish]]\u2014took precedence.<ref name=\"Entcast\" /> Work resumed immediately after Wright's departure from ''Ant-Man'', when the studio began assembling their roster of actors and technical staff before shooting.<ref name=\"Entcast\" /> In preparation, Wright spent time with ex-career criminals in Los Angeles and London to develop an accurate depiction of a real-life bank robber's work.<ref name=\"bdrt\" />\n\nWright, lead film editor [[Paul Machliss]], and Los Angeles-based editor Evan Schiff devised a pre-edit of ''Baby Driver'' with [[animatic]]s in the initial stages of production. With [[Media Composer|Avid Media Composer]], Machliss was tasked with syncopating each animatic to the corresponding song from the soundtrack. He and Wright had an existing professional relationship from ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'' and ''The World's End''.

Once filmed, DNEG supplemented the live-action shots with bullets, sparks, and gunfire flashes, while bearing in mind the imposing drum riffs of the soundtrack.<ref name=dneg/> The team found that compositing shots to audio, although suitable for live-action projects, presented unique challenges, such as how to convey emotional cues to the viewer.<ref name=dneg/>\n\nFor \"Brighton Rock\", the climactic sequence of ''Baby Driver'', DNEG enhanced footage with computer-generated shots for safety and damage control. First, to portray characters being pummeled by cars, the team filmed the accidents in stages. The footage was then composited into complete shots, lending a sense of realism and control.<ref name=dneg/> The shot of Buddy's stolen police car falling in the parking garage atrium from the top level required setting up a shorter, safer drop at another side of the garage with a crane to comply with the owner's demands.
