Its plot follows a teenage computer [[child prodigy|prodigy]] who implants a [[robot]]'s processor into the brain of his teenage neighbor after she is pronounced [[brain death|brain dead]]; the experiment proves successful, but she swiftly begins a killing spree in their neighborhood. It is based on the 1985 novel ''[[Friend (Henstell novel)|Friend]]'' by Diana Henstell, which was adapted for the screen by [[Bruce Joel Rubin]].\n\nOriginally, the film was a [[sci-fi]] [[Thriller film|thriller]] without any graphic scenes, with a bigger focus on plot and character development and a dark love story centering on the two main characters, which were not typical aspects of Craven's previous films. After Craven's original cut was shown to a test audience by Warner Bros., the audience criticized the lack of graphic, bloody violence and gore that Craven's other films included. Warner Bros. executive vice president [[Mark Canton]] and the film's producers then demanded script re-writes and re-shoots, which included filming gorier death scenes and nightmare sequences, similar to the ones from Craven's previous film, ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]''. Due to studio imposed re-shoots and re-editing, the film was drastically altered in post-production, losing much of the original plot and more scenes between characters, while other scenes, including more grisly deaths and a new ending, were added. According to the screen writer, this version was criticized by the studio for containing too much graphic, bloody violence and was cut back for release.<ref>{{cite AV media |format=Blu-ray |url=https://www.shoutfactory.com/product/deadly-friend-collector-s-edition |publisher=Shout Factory |title=Written in Blood - Interview with Writer Bruce Joel Rubin}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2014, an online petition for the release of the original cut was made.{{sfn|Maddrey|2015|p=10}}\n\n==Plot==\nTeenage prodigy Paul Conway and his mother Jeannie move into their new house in the town of Welling. He soon becomes friends with paperboy Tom Toomey. Living next door to Paul is Samantha Pringle and her abusive, alcoholic father Harry. Paul built a robot named BB, which occasionally displays autonomous behavior, such as being protective of Paul. Paul, Jeannie, and BB meet Paul's professor, Dr. Johanson, at Polytech, a prestigious university where Paul has a scholarship.\n\nOne day, Tom, Paul and BB stop at the house of reclusive harridan Elvira Parker, who threatens them with a shotgun. The trio then encounters a motorcycle gang led by bully Carl. When Carl intimidates Paul, BB assaults him. Another day, while playing basketball, BB accidentally tosses the ball onto Elvira's porch. She takes the ball away from them and refuses to give it back. On [[Halloween]] night, Tom decides to pull a prank on Elvira with the help of Paul, Samantha and BB. BB unlocks her gate and Samantha rings her doorbell. When alarms go off, they hide in a shrubbery nearby. When Elvira sees BB standing near her porch, she destroys him with her shotgun, devastating Paul.\n\nOn [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], Samantha has dinner with Paul and his mother, and Samantha and Paul share their first kiss. Samantha returns home late at night, outraging her father, who pushes her down the stairs. At the hospital, Paul learns that Samantha is [[brain dead]] and will be on life support for 24 hours before the plug is pulled. As BB's microchip can interface with the human brain, Paul decides to use it to revive Samantha with Tom's help. The boys enter the hospital using a key taken from Tom's father, who works there as a security guard. After Tom deactivates the power from the basement, Paul takes Samantha to his lab. He inserts the microchip into Samantha's brain and takes her back to his house, hiding her in the shed. After he activates the microchip, Samantha \"wakes up\", but her mannerisms are completely mechanical, suggesting BB is in control of her body.\n\nIn the middle of the night, Paul finds Samantha staring at the window, looking at her father, and he deactivates her. The next morning, Paul finds Samantha gone. When Harry finds the cellar door open and goes downstairs, Samantha attacks him, breaks his wrist and snaps his neck. Paul finds Samantha, and Harry's corpse, in the cellar. Horrified, he hides the body, takes Samantha back to his home and locks her in his bedroom. At night, Samantha breaks into Elvira's house and corners her by throwing her to the wall of her living room. As Elvira screams in horror, Samantha kills her by smashing her head with the basketball stolen from Tom.\n\nWhen Tom learns of Samantha's rampage, he gets into a fight with Paul and threatens to call the police. Still being protective of Paul, Samantha jumps out the attic window and attacks Tom, with Paul and Jeannie intervening. Trying to get her under control, Paul slaps Samantha, resulting in her strangling him. Samantha, quickly coming to her senses, lets him go and runs away. As Paul goes after her, he again encounters Carl, who gets into a fight with him. Samantha goes back for Paul, grabs Carl and kills him by throwing him at an incoming police car. She runs back to Paul's shed, where Paul comforts her and realizes she's regaining some of her humanity. However, the police arrive with their guns aimed at Samantha, who yells out Paul's name in her human voice. She runs towards him, trying to protect him, but Sergeant Volchek ([[Lee Paul]]), thinking she's trying to attack him, shoots her. She says Paul's name one more time before dying in his arms.\n\nLater at the morgue, Paul tries to steal Samantha's body once more. Suddenly, Samantha grabs Paul's neck and her face rips apart, revealing a terrifying variant of BB's head. Her skin strips away, revealing half-robotic bones underneath. With a robotic voice, Samantha tells him to come with her. When a horrified Paul screams, she snaps his neck, killing him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Matthew Labyorteaux|Matthew Laborteaux]] as Paul Conway\n* [[Kristy Swanson]] as Samantha Pringle\n* [[Michael Sharrett]] as Tom Toomey\n* [[Anne Twomey (actor)|Anne Twomey]] as Jeannie Conway\n* [[Richard Marcus]] as Harry Pringle\n* [[Anne Ramsey]] as Elvira Parker\n* Andrew Roperto as Carl Denton\n* [[Lee Paul]] as Sergeant Charlie Volchek\n* [[Charles Fleischer]] as BB (voice)\n* [[Tom Spratley]] as Neighbor\n* [[Jim Ishida]] as Coroner\n* [[Russ Marin]] as Dr. Henry Johanson\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nWes Craven and Bruce Joel Rubin's original intent for the film was for it to be a science fiction thriller with the primary focus being on the dark love story between Paul and Samantha.\n\n===Casting===\nKristy Swanson, 16 years old at the time of filming, was cast as Samantha.{{sfn|Robb|2000|p=122}} She admitted that Craven was unsure of her capability to play the role, but ultimately cast her, and was \"always encouraging...&nbsp;always prodding me in subtle ways.\"{{sfn|Robb|2000|p=122}} She elaborated in a 1996 interview: \"I committed myself completely to it. I just went full out with it. I wanted to do the best job I could possibly do. I was having the time of my life. As for the movie itself, some people love it, some people hate it. It is what it is. I really enjoyed making ''Deadly Friend''. At that point in my life, it was spectacular.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-228|title=The Phantom's Lady|page=99|work=Starlog Magazine|issue=228|date=July 1, 1996}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nProfessional mime artist Richmond Shepard taught Swanson all of the robotic movements that her character has in the film. In an interview, Swanson said this about learning to walk in that specific way: \"Getting those moves down was difficult at first. You don't think walking that way is hard until you actually try doing it. But Richmond was a good teacher and I picked up on most of the moves pretty quickly.\"\n\nDuring filming of one of the studio-demanded scenes where Sam has a nightmare where her father attacks her in her room and she stabs him with a glass vase, there were difficulties on set with the special effects. Swanson mentioned, \"The scene was set up so that I would hit a protective device inside his shirt. But during one take, I missed the device and glass actually shattered on his chest. I freaked out because I thought I had really stuck this glass into his chest. Everybody else just laughed.\" In another incident, the great amount of fake blood turned out to be a problem. \"We had been working on that scene a long time. Finally, it was time for blood to spray out, but something leaked and we had blood spraying all over the set and myself. I was so tired that I started yelling, \"More blood!\" and the effects people really pumped it out.\"<ref>Fangoria #60, \"The Prettiest Deadly Friend,\" Page 51</ref>\n\nIn an interview with ''Maxim'' magazine in May of 2000, Swanson said that the fake head of Elvira that was decimated by the basketball was stuffed with actual cow brains that the production crew picked up from a butcher shop. In a 2006 interview for [[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|''The Hills Have Eyes'']], Craven mentioned problems that the basketball scene had with the MPAA: \"On ''Deadly Friend'', we had a scene where a nasty old lady gets her head knocked off with a basketball. The actual scene as it was originally cut was fabulous. She was running around the room like a chicken with its head cut off for ten, fifteen seconds. It was bizarre and wonderful and they cut the shit out of it. So I compiled what we called our \"Decapitation Compilation,\" all the films that I knew of that had decapitations in them that had an R, and sent it to them. They immediately sent it back saying they just base it on what they feel in the room at the time. And we had like eight or ten films in there, like [[The Omen (1976 film)|''The Omen'']] where the guy gets his head cut off by the sheet of glass, and it didn't matter to them.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chud.com/6125/exclusive-interview-wes-craven-the-hills-have-eyes/|title=EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: WES CRAVEN (THE HILLS HAVE EYES)|website=Chud.com|access-date=31 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nCraven had a hand in selecting Bruce Joel Rubin to write the screenplay for ''Deadly Friend''. Rubin agreed with Craven that the film should have a gentler tone than his other features. Craven couldn't write the script himself because he was directing episodes of [[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|''The Twilight Zone'']] at the time. Craven and producer Robert M. Sherman hired Rubin as the screenwriter because they read his script for ''[[Jacob's Ladder (1990 film)|Jacob's Ladder]]'', which was unproduced at the time.<ref>Fangoria #57, \"Wes Craven's Deadly Doubleheader,\" page 50</ref>\n\nFor the scene chronicling the transplant of BB's microchip into Samantha's brain, Craven called on the advice of retired neurosurgeon William H. Faeth, who has a cameo in the film as a coroner in Sam's hospital room. Craven said that he was very helpful on all the anatomical details.{{sfn|Robb|2000|p=121}}\n\nThe robot, BB, cost over $20,000 to build. Craven used a company called Robotics 21. His eyes were constructed from two 1950's camera lenses, a garage remote control unit, and a radio antenna taken from a Corvette. BB could actually lift 7,500 pounds in weight. The voice of BB was provided by Charles Fleischer, who appeared in Wes Craven's previous film ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' as a doctor.{{sfn|Robb|2000|p=190}}\n\nEarlier in production when the film was originally going to be a PG-rated sci-fi thriller, Craven wanted to make something that was similar to John Carpenter's 1984 sci-fi film [[Starman (film)|''Starman'']]. Also, according to Swanson in a 1987 interview with Fangoria writer Mark Shapiro, \"Craven suggested that I take a look at the movie ''Starman'' because what he wanted to do with ''Deadly Friend'' was similar in tone to that film.\" John Carpenter directed ''Starman'' because he wanted to get away from his reputation as a director of violent films, just like Wes Craven wanted to make ''Deadly Friend'' with a PG rating in mind so he could prove that he could make a film that was not simply \"blood and guts\" horror.<ref>''Fangoria'' #60, \"The Prettiest Deadly Friend,\" pages 50-51 and 59</ref>\n\n===Post-production===\nAccording to the book ''Wes Craven: The Art of Horror'' by [[John Kenneth Muir]], Craven's original cut of the film was \"a teenage film filled with charm, wit, and solid performances by likeable teens Swanson and Laborteaux. It was definitely a mainstream, PG film all the way, similar in tone to ''[[Real Genius]]'' or [[Short Circuit (1986 film)|''Short Circuit'']], but the point was made that Craven could direct something other than double-barreled horror.\"{{sfn|Muir|2004|pages=120\u2013131}} After principal photography was completed, Craven's original version of the film was screened to a test audience mostly consisting of his fanbase. The response from them was negative, criticizing the lack of violence and gore seen in Craven's other films.<ref name=barone>{{cite web|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/745097-dead-women-scorned-deadly-friend-benefits-lazarus-effect|work=[[ComingSoon.net]]|last=Barone|first=Matt|date=March 2, 2015|title=Dead Women Scorned: How Deadly Friend Benefits from The Lazarus Effect|url-status=live|archive-date=February 8, 2020|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200208045848/https://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/745097-dead-women-scorned-deadly-friend-benefits-lazarus-effect}}</ref> Finding that Craven had a large fanbase within the horror genre, Warner Bros.' marketing team insisted that additional scenes of gore and horror be incorporated into the finished film.{{sfn|Robb|2000|p=120}}\n\nThe executive vice president of Warner Bros. at the time, [[Mark Canton]], had Rubin write six additional gore scenes into his script, each bloodier than the last. Following the negative reactions from test audiences that saw Craven's first cut of the film and wanted a much more grisly product, it was re-edited in post-production and the more graphic deaths and other re-shot scenes were included, making the final film appear tonally jumbled.{{sfn|Robb|2000|pages=119\u2013124}} Furthermore, with the additional gore introduced, the film struggled being granted an R rating with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) instead of an X due to the overt violence.{{sfn|Robb|2000|p=120}} According to Craven, the film was submitted a total of thirteen times before it was passed.{{sfn|Robb|2000|p=120}}\n\nEditor Michael Eliot was brought in by Warner Bros. to re-edit the original cut of ''Deadly Friend''. Eliot went on to do the same for two other Warner Bros. films, ''[[Out for Justice]]'' and ''[[Showdown in Little Tokyo]]''. While new scenes were added, others such as more scenes between Paul and Samantha that would have made the film more of a love story as originally intended were deleted for length and pacing reasons. Since re-writes, re-shoots, and post production re-editing heavily changed the original story, Craven and Rubin expressed strong anger and heartbreak at the studio and then virtually disowned the film.<ref>Fangoria #98, \"Climbing the Ladder of Success\", Page 54 (continued from page 27)</ref>\n\nCraven was no longer attracted to the story because of Samantha going on a killing spree when she is revived. He was much more interested in exploring the adults around her, all of whom seem to be monsters in human skin. In his own words: \"The scares don't come from her, but from the ordinary people, who are actually much more frightening. A father who beats a child is a terrifying figure. That's the one person you're afraid of in the movie. The idea is along the lines that adults can be horrible, without being outside what society says is acceptable.\"{{sfn|Robb|2000|p=122}}\n\nSwanson commented that she found herself and the other actors caught up in the studio's attempts to strong-arm Craven into making the film more visceral than what was originally intended. During both production and re-shoots, changes to the script were being made, title changes were being discussed, and there were many discussions about how violent and bloody the final film would be. All of these issues caused problems for the actors. Regarding the title changes, when Craven started the project, it was titled ''Friend'', much like the Diana Henstell novel it was based on. The title was later changed to ''Artificial Intelligence'' and then to ''A.I.'' before the studio and producers finally settled on ''Deadly Friend''.\n\n{{quotebox|align=right|width=25%|quote=\"We started off doing a picture that Warner Bros. indicated they wanted to do, a macabre love story with a twist. About five weeks into the shoot, they realized who I was and told me not to be inhibited by what they had told me in the past. In a way, I had held back. So, in the last week of shooting, I made up one little nightmare scene and put it into the film. It was the big hit of the screening. So then they came to me and said, 'Listen, what we need is more of that stuff. What we're doing is adding to the deaths of a few people, a jump for the beginning, a new closing scene, and two nightmares\u2014that sort of Wes Craven touch.'\"|source=\u2013Craven on the studio's interference in the final film{{sfn|Wooley|2011|p=120}}}}\n\nIn a 1990 interview with Fangoria journalist Daniel Schweiger, screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin said this about the ending and why it stayed in the film: \"That robot coming out of the girl's head belongs solely to Mark Canton, and you don't tell the president of Warner Bros. that his idea stinks!\" Rubin also said how at the time, people were still blaming him for the ending where Samantha turns into a robot, even though Canton was the one who conceived it. He also mentioned that despite the fact that the studio destroyed the love story of the movie that he and Craven enjoyed, he still enjoyed working with Craven, confirming that he was not the one who wanted to change the film and that he should not be blamed for what happened to it. Rubin even said that production was one of the happiest experiences he ever had.<ref>''Fangoria'' #98, \"Climbing the Ladder of Success,\" page 54</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/horror/pb_article_type/745097-dead-women-scorned-deadly-friend-benefits-lazarus-effect|title=Dead Women Scorned: How Deadly Friend Benefits from The Lazarus Effect |date=2 March 2015|website=Shocktillyoudrop.com|access-date=28 October 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn another interview, Rubin told the story about how the $36,000 that he got paid for writing the script for ''Deadly Friend'' saved him from going nearly broke due to the four months long Writer's Guild strike and also helped him with a bar mitzvah for his son and to buy a house. In the same interview, Rubin said how at first, he did not want to write the script, but after changing his mind, he called Robert M. Sherman and got the job. He also said how working on the film was one of the most extraordinary experiences of his life: \"It was a horror film with a lot of elements that are not things I wanted on my resume. And it didn't do very good business, but it was total fun. My kids were on the set every night. My five-year-old Ari was totally in love with Kristy Swanson, who was the lead. She later became [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]] in the movie. She was really sweet to him and even took him on a date.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cortlandreview.com/features/12/summer/bruce_joel_rubin_interview.php|title=Bruce Joel Rubin - Interview: Summer 2012 Feature |website=Cortlandreview.com|access-date=31 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Censorship===\nDue to all of the gore scenes that were added into the film\u2014as well as Craven's contentious history with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA)\u2014it was initially given an [[X rating]]. The film was trimmed and resubmitted to the MPAA thirteen times before it was granted an R-rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3AzQw__vdY|title=Wes Craven - Interview (1989)|date=September 3, 2009|access-date=October 28, 2022|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Most of the cuts were made to the death scenes of Harry and Elvira.\n\n===Marketing===\nThe theatrical trailer for the film released by Warner Bros. represented it as a straightforward horror film, omitting any reference to its science fiction elements, with BB not appearing in a single frame. The mixture of teenagers and terror as seen in the trailer implied that ''Deadly Friend'' would be like Craven's ''A Nightmare on Elm Street''. In an interview with ''Fangoria'',<ref>Fangoria #57, \"Wes Craven's Deadly Doubleheader, Page 53</ref> Craven said that the deadline for delivering the first cut of ''Deadly Friend'' with all of the studio-demanded sequences included, and delivering his original script for ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]'', which he was writing with [[Bruce Wagner]], was virtually the same, making it very difficult for him to do both things at once.\n\n===Box office===\nHoping to score a financial success with the Halloween trade, Warner Bros. released ''Deadly Friend'' in theaters on October 10, 1986 but the film was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing $8,988,731 in the United States against an $11 million budget.\n\n===Critical response===\n[[AllRovi|AllMovie]] gave the film a generally negative review, writing, \"It's an intriguing combination of elements, but the end result is a schizoid mess\", calling Craven's direction \"awkward\" and opining that it \"lacks the intense, sustained atmosphere of his previous horror hits.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://allmovie.com/movie/deadly-friend-v12777/review |title=Deadly Friend (1986) - Review - AllMovie |last=Guarisco |first=Donald |work=[[AllRovi|AllMovie]] |access-date=8 August 2012}}</ref> On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a 13% approval rating based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 4.3/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/deadly_friend |title=Deadly Friend (1986) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |access-date=March 16, 2022 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] it has a score of 44% based on reviews from 11 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Deadly Friend |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/deadly-friend |website=[[Metacritic]] }}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nIn 2007, Warner Bros. released a [[DVD]] edition featuring all of the death scenes in their fully uncut form.
