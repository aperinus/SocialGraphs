[[Woody Harrelson]], [[Sam Rockwell]], [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]], [[Peter Dinklage]], [[Abbie Cornish]], [[Lucas Hedges]], [[\u017deljko Ivanek]], and [[Caleb Landry Jones]] appear in supporting roles. The film was theatrically released in the United States in November 2017 and in the United Kingdom in January 2018 by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], and it grossed $160 million at the worldwide box office.\n\nCritical reception for the film was very positive, with particular acclaim given to McDonagh's screenplay and direction, as well as the performances of McDormand, Rockwell, and Harrelson. McDormand and Rockwell each won the [[90th Academy Awards|Academy Award]], [[75th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]], [[24th Screen Actors Guild Awards|SAG Award]], [[71st British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]], and [[23rd Critics' Choice Awards|Critics' Choice Award]] for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor, respectively, and Harrelson received Oscar, SAG, and BAFTA nominations. McDonagh won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Golden Globe Award]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay|BAFTA Award]] for his screenplay, and the film won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture&nbsp;\u2013 Drama|Golden Globe Award]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|BAFTA Award]] for Best Picture.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the fictional town of Ebbing, Missouri, Mildred Hayes is grieving over the rape and murder of her teenage daughter, Angela, seven months earlier. Angry over the lack of progress in the investigation, she rents three disused billboards near her home and posts on them: \"{{smallcaps|Raped While Dying}}\", \"{{smallcaps|And Still No Arrests?}}\", \"{{smallcaps|How Come, Chief Willoughby?}}\". They attract attention, so Bill Willoughby, the local chief of police, visits Mildred, but is unable to persuade her to take them down, even by revealing he has terminal [[pancreatic cancer]]. He renews his efforts to solve the case, but does not get anywhere.\n\nMany townspeople are upset by the billboards, including Jason Dixon, a racist, alcoholic police officer, who unsuccessfully tries to intimidate Red Welby, who rented Mildred the billboards, into taking them down. Mildred's dentist is sympathetic to Willoughby and menaces her during an appointment, so she drills a hole in his thumbnail. Willoughby brings her in for questioning and winds up coughing up blood into her face. He has her released and is hospitalized, though he soon checks himself out against medical advice.\n\nThe billboards have further strained Mildred's relationship with her son, Robbie, and she remembers that her last interaction with Angela was an argument. Her abusive ex-cop ex-husband Charlie confronts her about the billboards and ends up revealing that, shortly before Angela's murder, he had turned down her request to come live with him.\n\nAt his mother's suggestion, Dixon arrests Mildred's friend Denise on trivial drug possession charges to put pressure on Mildred. Willoughby spends an idyllic day with his wife, Anne, and their two daughters, and then [[suicide|takes his own life]] to spare his family from watching him die slowly. Dixon reacts to the news by assaulting Welby and throwing him out a second-story window. This is witnessed by Abercrombie, Willoughby's replacement, who fires Dixon.\n\nBefore his death, Willoughby wrote several letters, including one to Mildred. Anne delivers it, interrupting an unknown man who was menacing Mildred at work. In the letter, Willoughby tells Mildred that she was not a factor in his suicide and reveals he secretly paid to keep the billboards up another month.\n\nAfter the billboards are destroyed by [[arson]], Mildred retaliates by tossing [[Molotov cocktail]]s at the police station, which she believes to be unoccupied for the night. Unfortunately, Dixon is inside reading Willoughby's letter to him, which advises him to let go of hate and embrace love if he wants to be a detective someday, but, remaining calm, he escapes with Angela's case file. James, an acquaintance of Mildred, happens by and extinguishes Dixon's burning clothes before providing Mildred with an alibi. Dixon is put in the same hospital room as Welby, to whom he apologizes.\n\nJerome, who was part of the team that put up the billboards, brings Mildred a set of copies and helps her, Robbie, James, and Denise restore the signs. Discharged from the hospital, Dixon overhears the man who menaced Mildred bragging in a bar about raping a girl in the same manner as Angela. He notes the number on the man's Idaho license plate and then scratches the man's face to get a [[DNA profiling|DNA sample]], passively accepting the resulting beating. Meanwhile, Mildred is on a date with James to thank him. Charlie enters with his 19-year-old girlfriend Penelope and apologizes for burning the billboards when he was drunk. Unnerved that she retaliated against the wrong target, Mildred wants to go home, saying she and James can go out another time, but he tells her that he does not want to, as he sensed she was embarrassed to be seen with him.\n\nAbercrombie informs Dixon that the DNA sample is not a match and the man was overseas on military duty at the time of Angela's death. Dixon gives Mildred the disappointing news and, believing the man to be guilty of some other rape, the pair plan a trip to Idaho to kill him. As they set out, Mildred confesses that she set the police station on fire, which Dixon had already assumed. They both express uncertainty about their mission, and Mildred says they can decide what to do along the way.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- First 15 in the same order as the tombstone closing credits (with John Hawkes and Peter Dinklage, who received \"with\" credits between Samara Weaving and Kerry Condon, moved up to between Sam Rockwell and Abbie Cornish).
