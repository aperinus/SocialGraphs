It stars [[Nathan Lane]], [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]], [[Maury Chaykin]], and [[Christopher Walken]]. The film follows two [[Laurel and Hardy]]-like brothers in their struggle against one small but crafty [[house mouse]] for possession of a mansion which was willed to them by their father. While the film is set in the late 20th century, styles range humorously from the 1940s to the 1990s. It was the first family film to be released by [[DreamWorks Pictures]], who released it in the United States on December 19, 1997 to mixed reviews but was a commercial success.\n\nThis was one of [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]]'s final roles before he died, and the film is dedicated in memory of him.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen the once-wealthy string magnate Rudolf Smuntz dies, he leaves his factory and an abandoned [[Victorian house|Victorian]] mansion to his two sons: the dutiful and optimistic Lars, and [[Venality|venal]] cynic Ernie, who has ignored the family business to become a chef; he walks out of the reading of their father's will, taking a box of cigars. At Ernie's restaurant, a [[cockroach]] crawls out of the box of cigars and into a dish prepared for the mayor, causing him to have a [[heart attack]] when he accidentally bites into it and is taken away in an ambulance. Shortly after the mayor dies, Ernie's restaurant, Chez Ernie, is condemned and scheduled for demolition, costing Ernie his career and home in the process. Meanwhile, a cord company called Zeppco International offers Lars a buyout for the string factory, but then remembers that he promised his father never to sell it and refuses. Lars's wife, April, is furious and kicks him out. With nowhere else to go, the brothers spend the night in the mansion.\n\nThe brothers cannot sleep due to noises caused by a [[mouse]], and while investigating find blueprints of the property. The blueprints reveal that the mansion was the final design of a famous architect, Charles Lyle LaRue, and it would be worth a fortune if restored. The brothers decide to renovate and [[auction]] the mansion to recover their lives. Ernie, fearing a repeat of the cockroach incident, convinces Lars they must also get rid of the mouse. Conventional methods fail when the mouse demonstrates itself to be exceptionally intelligent. The brothers resort to extreme measures to remove the mouse, including buying a [[Monster|monstrous]] [[Maine Coon cat]] named \"Catzilla\" and hiring an eccentric [[pest control|exterminator]] named Caesar; the mouse drops Catzilla to his death in a dumbwaiter, and traumatizes Caesar by dragging him through the mansion using his truck's winch line.\n\nErnie had borrowed against the mansion's mortgage to pay for an unnecessary addition as part of the renovation. As the bank informs them that they will be evicted in two days unless they pay, they know that with their limited funds, the brothers cannot pay their workers, causing them to go on [[Strike action|strike]]. Ernie finds Zeppco's business card and arranges a meeting to secretly accept their buyout offer. After Lars accidentally loses his clothes to several machines while trying to run the factory alone, he is met by April, who has learned of the mansion's value and takes Lars back, giving him the funds they need. Ernie then misses his meeting with Zeppco's representatives when he attempts to impress some women and is hit by a bus. The brothers return to the mansion only to witness a now-insane Caesar being taken away by paramedics.\n\nRealizing the mouse's intelligence, the brothers become more desperate to kill him. Ernie chases the mouse with a shotgun and accidentally shoots a [[bug bomb]] Caesar had dropped, blowing a massive hole in the floor and sending him and Lars tumbling. As the brothers recover from the blast, Zeppco calls and leaves a message, saying they have taken back their proposal since Lars declined their offer and Ernie never showed up for the meeting. Angry at each other for the deceptions, the brothers get into a heated argument. Lars throws an [[orange (fruit)|orange]] at Ernie, which misses Ernie but hits the mouse, who is stunned but still alive. The brothers cannot bring themselves to kill the mouse and mail him in a box addressed to [[Fidel Castro]]. The brothers reconcile and finish their renovations. The night of the auction, Lars discovers the postal box returned due to insufficient postage and a hole chewed in it, while Ernie sees the mouse on his podium as he gives a speech. As the auction begins, the brothers attempt to flush the mouse out with a garden hose, filling an inner wall of the mansion with water until it bursts, washing the bidders out and causing the estate to collapse. As April leaves with a wealthy bidder and the other bidders, the brothers are left with nothing, but take solace in that the collapse indeed killed the mouse.\n\nThe brothers spend the night in the factory, unaware that the mouse has survived, and followed them. Seeing their sorry state, the mouse takes pity on them and activates the factory's machinery, dropping a block of cheese into the wax boiler to produce a ball of [[string cheese]]. Inspired, the brothers end their battle with the mouse and renovate the factory to produce string cheese and other [[cheese]]-based products. Lars (now having formed a relationship with a Belgian model named Hilde) runs the factory with Ernie as his chef and the mouse as their taste-tester for new cheese combinations. The film ends with a shot of Rudolf's lucky string (the last thing he gave the brothers before he passed) framed and with a plaque underneath it saying his motto: \"A world without string is chaos.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nathan Lane]] as Ernie Smuntz, a man who refused heirdom to his father's string factory to become a chef.\n* [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]] as Lars Smuntz, Ernie's brother and the heir to their father's string factory.\n* [[Maury Chaykin]] as Alexander Falko, a wealthy LaRue collector.\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Caesar, an odd and eccentric exterminator hired by the Smuntz brothers to rid them of the mouse.\n* [[Vicki Lewis]] as April Smuntz, Lars' [[gold digger|money-hungry]] former wife.\n* [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]] as Rudolf Smuntz, a string magnate and the late father of Ernie and Lars.\n* [[Eric Christmas]] as Ernie and Lars' lawyer.\n* [[Michael Jeter]] as Quincy Thorpe, a LaRue historian.\n* [[Cliff Emmich]] as Mayor McKrinkle.\n* [[Debra Christofferson]] as Ingrid, a [[Belgian people|Belgian]] model.\n* [[Camilla S\u00f8eberg]] as Hilde, a Belgian model.\n* [[Ian Abercrombie]] as the auctioneer.\n* [[Annabelle Gurwitch]] as Roxanne Atkins, a photographer.\n* [[Eric Poppick]] as Theodore Plumb, the banker.\n* [[Ernie Sabella]] as Maury, a worker at the cat shelter.\n* [[Jack Angeles]] as Kennel Employee\n* [[Frank Welker]] as:\n**The mouse, a [[house mouse]] who battles Lars and Ernie for the house.\n**Catzilla, a psychotic [[Monster|monstrous]] [[Maine Coon cat]] on steroids adopted by the Smuntz brothers to kill the mouse.

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two stars, calling it \"not very funny, and maybe couldn't have been very funny no matter what, because the pieces for comedy are not in place... A comedy that hasn't assigned sympathy to some characters and made others hateful cannot expect to get many laughs, because the audience doesn't know who to laugh at, or with.\" Though partner Gene Siskel liked the film.\n\nRegarding the digital special effects, Ebert deemed the film \"an excellent example of the way modern advances in special effects can sabotage a picture (''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' is an example of effects being used wisely). Because it is possible to make a movie in which the mouse can do all sorts of clever things, the filmmakers have assumed incorrectly that it would be funny to see the mouse doing them.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mouse-hunt-1997|title=Mouse Hunt Movie Review & Film Summary (1997) - Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=www.rogerebert.com}}</ref>\n\nNonetheless, the film was a financial success, partially due to releasing during the Christmas and New Years period.
