Seaman]]. The film is loosely based on the [[Last Holiday (1950 film)|1950 British film of the same name]] by [[J. B. Priestley]]. The film stars [[Queen Latifah]] as Georgia, a humble [[department store]] assistant who is told that she has a rare brain condition and only has a few weeks to live. She promptly decides to spend her remaining funds on a luxury holiday in Europe before she dies.\n\nPrice and Seaman wanted [[John Candy]] for the main role but, after Candy's death, Latifah's agent suggested a new version starring her. Produced by [[Robert Zemeckis]]' [[ImageMovers]], the film was released by [[Paramount Pictures]] on January 13, 2006. The film was a [[box-office bomb]], having grossed $43.3 million against a budget of $45 million and received mixed reviews from critics, though Latifah's performance was universally praised for her charm and humor.\n\n==Plot==\nGeorgia Byrd is a shy, unassuming salesperson in the cookware department at Kragen's Department Store in [[New Orleans]] and a Baptist choir singer who longs to cook professionally. She privately records her dreams of a better life in a scrapbook labeled \"Possibilities\" enjoys replicating TV chef [[Emeril Lagasse]]'s gourmet recipes, serving her creations to a neighbor while denying herself the pleasure of eating them. During the Christmas season, while flirting with a handsome co-worker named Sean Williams, whom she has secretly featured in her scrapbook as her dream husband, Georgia bumps her head on a kitchen cabinet door and is taken to the store's health center for a [[CT scan]]. There, she is told by company physician Dr. Rabindranath Gupta that she has several [[brain tumor]]s resulting from a rare terminal neurological disorder called [[List of fictional diseases#In film|Lampington's disease]]. Since her [[Health maintenance organization|HMO plan]] cannot cover the high cost of an operation, Georgia resigns herself to having only a few weeks to live, quits her job, liquidates her assets and sets off on a dream vacation at the deluxe [[Grandhotel Pupp]] in the [[Czech Republic]]'s spa city of [[Karlovy Vary]].\n\nFree of inhibitions and determined to enjoy the final weeks of her life, Georgia checks into the Presidential Suite for $4000 per night, buys a designer wardrobe in expensive boutiques, makes extensive use of the hotel's spa facilities, attempts snowboarding and [[BASE jumping]] off a dam, enjoys succulent meals prepared by world-renowned Chef Didier, and wins a small fortune playing roulette in the casino.\n\nGeorgia impresses the hotel's staff, with the exception of cantankerous guest services manager Ms. Gunther, with her naive manner and forthright kindness, and mingles with some of the other guests, including Matthew Kragen, an arrogant self-help guru and coincidentally the owner of the department store where she worked; Kragen's assistant/mistress Ms. Burns; and [[Louisiana]] power brokers Senator Dillings and Congressman Stewart. Kragen is skeptical about Georgia and suspects her of trying to sabotage his business, but the rest are charmed by her free spirit.\n\nWhen Kragen bribes Ms. Gunther to dig up information about Georgia's background, she goes through her hotel suite and finds a letter Georgia has written providing instructions for the disposition of her remains after her death. Moved by the letter and realizing Georgia's self-confidence and sunny optimism have touched everyone who has met her since her arrival, Ms. Gunther confesses to Georgia she snooped through her belongings and found the letter, urging her to return home and spend her last days with those she loves. Taking Ms. Gunther's advice, Georgia heads for the airport but discovers an avalanche has blocked the road. Unbeknownst to her, Sean, having learned of Georgia's diagnosis and ready to acknowledge his long-standing feelings for her, has flown to Europe and is in a taxi on the other side of the snowdrift, blocked from reaching her at the hotel.\n\nGeorgia returns to the hotel, and Sean leaves his taxi to hike across the snow on foot. Chef Didier invites Georgia to assist him in the hotel's kitchen that night preparing an extravagant New Year's Eve feast and thanks her publicly at the party. Later, seated at dinner and incensed by the accolades and affection Georgia has received, Kragen tries to humiliate her to his companions by exposing her as a saleswoman in one of his stores, but Georgia confirms this and reveals her terminal illness. Kragen's companions, disgusted by his insensitivity, embrace her and abandon him. Dejected and embarrassed, Kragen goes to an upper floor of the hotel and sits on the ledge, contemplating suicide. Georgia tries to dissuade this, suggesting if he were nicer and less driven by greed, he would be a happier person.\n\nSean arrives at the hotel just in time and joins Georgia on the ledge, confessing his affection for her and admitting he'd seen her scrapbook of \"Possibilities\". In the lobby, Ms. Gunther finds a fax for Georgia from Dr. Gupta stating she was misdiagnosed by a faulty CT scanner and did not have Lampington's disease after all. Ms. Gunther rushes up to the ledge to announce the good news. Georgia and Sean return to New Orleans as a couple where they open a restaurant, Georgia's Joint, which is visited by Chef Didier and [[Emeril Lagasse]].\n\nAn epilogue sequence shows that Georgia changed her Book of Possibilities into the Book of Realities, and her friends from the hotel all lived better lives: Ms. Burns went to spa management school, Ms. Gunther opened a detective agency, and Dr. Gupta and Matthew Kragen joined a spiritual retreat after Gupta quit his job and Kragen's wife divorced him. And that Georgia and Sean got married while skydiving.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Queen Latifah]] as Georgia Byrd\n* [[LL Cool J]] as Sean Matthews\n* [[Timothy Hutton]] as Matthew Kragen\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as Senator Dillings\n* [[Alicia Witt]] as Ms. Allison Burns\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as Chef Didier\n* [[Jane Adams (actress, born 1965)|Jane Adams]] as Rochelle\n* [[Susan Kellermann]] as Ms. Gunther\n* [[Ranjit Chowdhry]] as Dr. Rabindranath Gupta\n* [[Michael Nouri]] as Congressman Stewart\n* [[Jascha Washington]] as Darius\n* [[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]] as Mr. Adamian\n* [[Emeril Lagasse]] as Himself\n* [[Smokey Robinson]] as Himself\n\n==Production==\nIn the original 1950 film, the leading character of George Bird was played by [[Alec Guinness]]. Screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (of ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' and ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' fame) updated the story for [[John Candy]], with [[Carl Reiner]] directing,<ref name=candy>{{cite web|last=Siskel|first=Gene|title=Sour Movies Keep Candy Just Short Of Sweet Success|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-30/entertainment/8601230533_1_sctv-film-summer-rental/3|date=March 30, 1986|access-date=July 26, 2015}}</ref> but the project was shelved after the actor's death in 1994. Years later, [[Queen Latifah]]'s agent read their script and suggested they revise it for her.\n\nThe gourmet cuisine seen throughout the film was prepared by chefs from the [[Food Network]], and recipes for many of the dishes, including Lobster Salad in Potato Leek Nests, Duck Hash on Toasted Baguette, Spiced Lamb Shanks with Blood Orange Relish, Roasted Quail with Brioche and Chorizo Stuffing, Risotto Barolo with Roasted Vegetables, [[Bananas Foster]] and Poulet Tchoupitoulas, were available on the network's website. In one scene, Georgia watches footage from ''[[Emeril Live]]'' to help her prepare a chicken. As part of the film's promotion, Queen Latifah appeared as a guest on Lagasse's show.\n\nThe film opened on 2,514 screens in the US, earning $12,806,188 and ranking number two in its opening weekend. It eventually grossed $38,399,961 in the US and $4,943,287 in foreign markets for a worldwide box office total of $43,343,248.<ref name=\"mojo\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nQueen Latifah was nominated for the [[NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture]].\n\nThe aggregate site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film an approval rating of {{RT data|score}} based on {{RT data|count}} reviews, and an average rating of {{RT data|average}}. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Although Queen Latifah's bountiful life-affirming spirit permeates the film, director Wayne Wang is unable to revive this remake with any real flair.\"<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/last_holiday_2006|title=Last Holiday (2006)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]]|access-date={{RT data|access date|df=iso}}}}{{RT data|edit}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' said the film \"takes advantage of the great good nature and warmth of Queen Latifah, and uses it to transform a creaky old formula into a comedy that is just plain lovable. To describe the plot is to miss the point, because this plot could have been made into countless movies not as funny and charming as this one ... All depends on the Queen, who has been known to go over the top on occasion, but in this film finds all the right notes and dances to them delightfully. It is good to attend to important cinema like ''[[Syriana]]'' and ''[[Munich (2005 film)|Munich]]'', but on occasion we must be open to movies that have more modest ambitions: They only want to amuse us, warm us, and make us feel good. ''Last Holiday'' plays like a hug.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Last Holiday|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060112/REVIEWS/60110003/1023|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=January 13, 2006|access-date=January 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\nRuthe Stein of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' stated, \"Latifah's latest vehicle inexorably marches toward an ending you can see coming from the first reel ... This harmless bit of fluff lacks the element of surprise but is not without random charming moments supplied by its incandescent star.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Stein|first=Ruthe|title=Deadly diagnosis leads to fatally predictable story|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Deadly-diagnosis-leads-to-fatally-predictable-2506332.php|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=January 13, 2006|access-date=January 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\nJessica Reaves of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' awarded the film three out of four stars and described Queen Latifah as \"soft, bold and very funny, infusing this otherwise predictable movie with a contagious charm.\" She added, \"While this is not exactly a profound film, and the message is hardly new, it's testament to this movie's joyous energy that it doesn't matter in the least. We may know exactly where we're going, but the journey is so much fun, all but the most peevish audience members will find it impossible to complain.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Reeves|first=Jessica|title=Movie review: ''Last Holiday''|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/mmx-060113-movies-review-holiday,0,5923938.story|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=January 13, 2006|access-date=January 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\nJanet K. Keeler of the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' graded the film B- and commented, \"Strong performances by Latifah, LL Cool J and Depardieu, who is strangely but perfectly cast, save ''Last Holiday'' from irrelevance. Latifah is more than the funny girl with attitude we've seen in ''[[Bringing Down the House (film)|Bringing Down the House]]'', ''[[Taxi (2004 film)|Taxi]]'' and ''[[Beauty Shop]]''. She's got the goods to play the leading lady, and a sexy one at that. Latifah's performance here isn't as good as her Oscar-nominated turn in ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'', but it shows off more range and a subtler touch than subsequent movies.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Keeler|first=Janet|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/01/12/Weekend/Saving_the_best_for_l.shtml|title=Saving the best for last|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=January 12, 2006|access-date=January 6, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806072908/http://www.sptimes.com/2006/01/12/Weekend/Saving_the_best_for_l.shtml|archive-date=August 6, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website|https://www.paramountmovies.com/movies/last-holiday}}\n* {{IMDb title|0408985}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|10004662-last_holiday}}\n{{Wayne Wang}}\n\n[[Category:2006 films]]\n[[Category:2000s Christmas comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2006 romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:African-American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:African-American romance films]]\n[[Category:American Christmas comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American remakes of British films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about death]]\n[[Category:Films about vacationing]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Wayne Wang]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Laurence Mark]]\n[[Category:Films scored by George Fenton]]\n[[Category:Films set in department stores]]\n[[Category:Films set in hotels]]\n[[Category:Films set in New Orleans]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Czech Republic]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Austria]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Orleans]]\n[[Category:Films shot in the Czech Republic]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jeffrey Price and Peter S.
