They want to perform only one time at a music competition. They approach famous writer Dries to be their drummer, the idea being that he also has a \"handicap\" in that he cannot actually play the drums. They plan to master only one song, [[Devo]]'s \"Mongoloid.\" For Dries, this is an opportunity to get some inspiration for a new novel, so he accepts the offer. The band members decide to call the band The Feminists, since, they think four \"handicapped\" musicians are just as worthless as a group of feminists. Their main opponents are the band Harry Mulisch (an allusion to [[Harry Mulisch]]), also led by a writer, nicknamed Dikke Lul (\"Fat Cock\"). As the story goes on Dries becomes more and more obsessed by his new novel and he tries to manipulate the band members and tries to find their weak spot.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dries Vanhegen]]: Dries\n* [[Norman Baert]]: Koen de Geyter\n* [[Sam Louwyck]]: Ivan Van Dorpe\n* [[Gunter Lamoot]]: Jan Verbeek\n* [[Tristan Versteven]]: Dorian\n* [[Dolores Bouckaert]]: Lio\n* [[Barbara Callewaert]]: Christine\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Beukelaers]]: Pa Verbeek\n* [[Bernadette Damman]]: Ma Verbeek\n* Jan Hammenecker: Dikke Lul\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe music of The Feminists was in fact performed by Belgian band [[Millionaire (band)|Millionaire]] and the Harry Mulisch song was sung by Belgian singer [[Flip Kowlier]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.hifi.nl/recensies/3126/Ex-drummer.html\n| title      = Recensie Ex Drummer\n| work       = hifi.nl\n| first      = Jan\n| last       = Luijsterburg\n| date       = 20 September 2007\n| language   = dutch\n|trans-title=Ex Drummer review}}</ref>\n\n# [[Lightning Bolt (band)|Lightning Bolt]] \u2013 \"2 Morro Morro Land\"\n# [[Madensuyu]] \u2013 \"Papa Bear\"\n# [[An Pierl\u00e9 & White Velvet]] \u2013 \"Need You Now\"\n# [[The Tritones]] \u2013 \"Chagrin De La Mer\"\n# [[Mogwai]] \u2013 \"Hunted by a Freak\"\n# [[The Experimental Tropic Blues Band]] \u2013 \"Mexico Dream Blues\"\n# [[Flip Kowlier]] \u2013 \"De Grotste Lul Van 't Stad\"\n# [[Millionaire (band)|Millionaire]] \u2013 \"Mongoloid\"\n# [[Isis (band)|Isis]] \u2013 \"In Fiction\"\n# [[Isis (band)|Isis]] \u2013 \"Grinning Mouths\"\n# [[Arno Hintjens]] \u2013 \"Een Boeket Met Pissebloemen\"\n# [[Augusta National Golf Club (band)|Augusta National Golf Club]] \u2013 \"People in Pairs\"\n# [[Mel Dune]] \u2013 \"Time Hangs Heavy on Your Hands\"\n# [[Ghinzu]] \u2013 \"Blow\"\n# [[Funeral Dress]] \u2013 \"Hello from the Underground\"\n# [[Millionaire (band)|Millionaire]] \u2013 \"Deep Fish\"\n# [[Blutch]] \u2013 \"Moving Ground\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beltunes.be/muziek_itunes_nieuws.php?id=145 |title=Soundtrack ex drummer |access-date=2009-09-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218082645/http://www.beltunes.be/muziek_itunes_nieuws.php?id=145 |archive-date=18 February 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mixed reviews.
