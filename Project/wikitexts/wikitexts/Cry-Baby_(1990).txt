It was the only film of Waters's over which studios were in a bidding war, coming off the heels of the successful ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]''. The film stars [[Johnny Depp]] as 1950s teen rebel \"Cry-Baby\" Wade Walker, and also features a large [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Amy Locane]], [[Polly Bergen]], [[Susan Tyrrell]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[Ricki Lake]] and [[Traci Lords]], with appearances by [[Troy Donahue]], [[Mink Stole]], [[Joe Dallesandro]], [[Joey Heatherton]], [[David Nelson (actor)|David Nelson]], [[Willem Dafoe]], and [[Patricia Hearst]].\n\nThe film centers on a group of [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquent youth]] who refer to themselves as \"drapes\" and their interaction with the rest of the town and its other subculture, the \"squares\", in 1950s [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. \"Cry-Baby\" Walker, a drape, and Allison, a square, disturb Baltimore society by breaking the subculture taboos and falling in love. The film shows what the young couple has to overcome to be together and how their actions affect the rest of the town.\n\nPart of the film takes place at the now-closed [[Enchanted Forest (Maryland)|Enchanted Forest]] [[amusement park]] in [[Ellicott City, Maryland]]. Others take place in the historic neighborhoods and towns of [[Hampden, Maryland|Hampden]], [[Baltimore City]], [[Reisterstown]], [[Jessup, Maryland|Jessup]], [[Milford Mill, Maryland|Milford Mill]], and [[Sykesville, Maryland|Sykesville]], Maryland. The only scenes not filmed in Maryland were shot at [[Golden Oak Ranch]] in [[Santa Clarita Valley]], [[California]].\n\nA box office failure during its initial release, the film has subsequently become a [[Cult film|cult classic]] and spawned a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Cry-Baby (musical)|musical of the same name]] which was nominated for four [[Tony Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1954 Baltimore, Wade \"Cry-Baby\" Walker leads a gang of \"[[Greaser (subculture)|drapes]]\", which includes his sister Pepper, a teenage mother; facially-disfigured Mona \"Hatchet Face\" Malnorowski; Wanda Woodward, whose post-World War II normal parents constantly embarrass her; and Milton Hackett, Hatchet Face's devoted boyfriend. Walker's ability to shed a single tear excites all the girls. One day after school, Allison Vernon-Williams, a beautiful girl tired of being a \"square\", approaches him, and the two fall in love. <!-- (\"''Women in Cadillacs''\", \"''Gee!''\"), -->  That same day, Cry-Baby interrupts a talent show <!-- (\"''[[Sh-Boom]]''\", \"''A Teenage Prayer''\") --> at the charm school run by Allison's grandmother, and introduces himself to her, who doubts his motives. Cry-Baby invites Allison to a party at Turkey Point, a local hangout spot for the drapes.\n\nDespite her grandmother's skepticism, Allison accompanies Cry-Baby to Turkey Point, where she is given a \"drape\" makeover by Hatchet Face, Pepper and Wanda, and sings a duet onstage with Cry-Baby<!-- (\"''King Cry-Baby''\") -->. Later, Cry-Baby tells Allison that his father was sent to the [[electric chair]] for being the \"Alphabet Bomber\" \u2013 a killer who bombed places in alphabetical order \u2015 along with his mother as an accomplice. Allison tells him that her parents took separate flights for safety, but both planes went down, orphaning her. While they are talking, Allison's jealous square boyfriend, Baldwin, ignites a riot. Cry-Baby is wrongfully blamed for the fight and sent to a [[Prison|penitentiary]], outraging all his friends and even Allison's grandmother, who is impressed by Cry-Baby's clear love for Allison. <!-- (\"''Teardrops Are Falling''\") -->\n\nWhen Lenora Frigid, a loose girl with an unrequited crush on Cry-Baby, claims to be pregnant with his child, Allison feels betrayed and returns to Baldwin and the squares, though her grandmother warns her against rushing into a decision. <!-- (\"''Doin' Time Bein' Young''\") --> Meanwhile, in the penitentiary, Cry-Baby gets a [[teardrop tattoo]] from fellow drape Dupree (Robert Tyree), telling him, \"I've been hurt all my life, but real tears wash away. This one's for Allison, and I want it to last forever!\"\n\nEventually, after performing with Baldwin and the Whiffles<!-- (\"''[[Mr. Sandman]]''\") --> at a new theme park, Allison is persuaded by the newly established alliance between the Drapes and her grandmother to stand by Cry-Baby and join the campaign for his release<!-- (\"''Please, Mr. Jailer''\") -->. She goes to sing in front of the jail with the other drapes. Their performance persuades the judge to release Cry-Baby. Baldwin immediately insults him, revealing that his grandfather electrocuted Cry-Baby's father and that his family laughs about that. Cry-Baby challenges him to a [[Chicken (game)#Popular versions|chicken race]]. <!-- (\"''High School Hellcats''\") --> Cry-Baby wins, as Baldwin chickens out, and is reunited with Allison. During the race, Pepper gives birth to a baby in the backseat, and her boyfriend proposes by holding up a sign.\n\nThe film ends with all watching the chicken race crying a single tear, except for Allison and Cry-Baby, who has finally let go of the past, enabling him to cry from both eyes.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as Wade \"Cry-Baby\" Walker\n** [[James Intveld]] as Cry-Baby's singing voice\n* [[Amy Locane]] as Allison Vernon-Williams\n** [[Rachel Sweet]] as Allison's singing voice\n* [[Polly Bergen]] as Mrs. Vernon-Williams\n* [[Ricki Lake]] as Pepper Walker\n* [[Traci Lords]] as Wanda Woodward\n* [[Kim McGuire]] as Mona \"Hatchet-Face\" Malnorowski\n* [[Darren E.
