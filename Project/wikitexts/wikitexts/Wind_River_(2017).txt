The film stars [[Jeremy Renner]] and [[Elizabeth Olsen]] as a [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] [[Tracking (hunting)|tracker]] and an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent, respectively, who try to solve a murder on the [[Wind River Indian Reservation]] in [[Wyoming]]. [[Gil Birmingham]], [[Jon Bernthal]], and [[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]] also star.\n\nSheridan has said that he wrote the film to raise awareness of the issue of [[Missing and murdered Indigenous women|the high number of Indigenous women who are raped and murdered]], both on and off reservations.\n\n''Wind River'' premiered at the [[2017 Sundance Film Festival]] and was released in the United States on August 4, 2017. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and was a box office success, grossing $45 million against an $11 million budget. It was theatrically released by [[The Weinstein Company]] (TWC), but in October 2017, following the reporting of [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|numerous sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein]], the film's distribution rights for home media were acquired by [[Lionsgate]]. Weinstein's credits and logo were omitted on home media and streaming services, as TWC lost its distribution rights.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- [[WP:FILMPLOT]] plots section should be 400 to 700 words. -->\nDuring the winter on [[Wyoming]]'s [[Wind River Indian Reservation]], [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] Agent Cory Lambert discovers the frozen body of 18-year-old Natalie Hanson. FBI Special Agent Jane Banner arrives to investigate the possible [[homicide]]. Banner learns from Natalie's father Martin that his daughter was dating a new boyfriend who is unknown to him. Natalie's [[autopsy]] shows signs of [[blunt trauma]] and [[rape]], and confirms Lambert's deduction that Natalie died from [[pulmonary hemorrhage]] caused by inhaling [[freezing air temperature|subzero air]]. The [[medical examiner]] is unable to classify the death as a homicide, so Banner cannot get additional help from her supervisors.\n\nLambert discovers that Natalie's boyfriend is Matt Rayburn, who works as a [[security guard]] at a nearby oil drilling site. Lambert and Banner soon discover Matt's naked, mutilated body in the snow. Lambert reveals to Banner that his 16-year-old daughter Emily died in a similar manner to Natalie three years earlier, and the case remains unsolved.\n\nBanner, [[Indian tribal police|tribal police]] Chief Ben Shoyo, and other law enforcement officers visit the drilling site where they are met by Curtis, the security supervisor, and several security guards. They claim Matt left a few days prior following an argument with Natalie. One guard mentions they heard about Natalie's body being found and Banner states that Natalie's name has not been released to the public. The guards claim they learned it by monitoring a [[police scanner]]. One of Banner's team notices the guards are slowly surrounding them and draws his weapon. The confrontation quickly escalates into an armed standoff which Banner defuses.\n\nIn a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], Matt's drunken colleagues barge into his trailer while he is in bed with Natalie. Matt is provoked to violence, and the other guards retaliate while Pete rapes Natalie. Matt is beaten to death but his attempt to fight back gives Natalie an opportunity to try to escape by running cross-country to the mobile home where her brother lives. \n\nIn the present, Lambert traces the tracks from where Matt's corpse was found back to the drilling camp. As Banner and the others approach Pete's trailer, Lambert radios a warning to Shoyo. Pete responds to a veiled warning from Curtis by firing a shotgun through the door, wounding Banner. A gunfight ensues, and Shoyo and the other officers are killed. As the remaining guards prepare to execute Banner, Lambert kills four with his rifle. A wounded Pete flees on foot but Lambert apprehends him. At [[Gannett Peak]], Lambert forces Pete to confess, then offers him the same chance Natalie had; rather than being shot, he can try to stay alive by running to a distant road while barefoot and wearing only lightweight clothing. Pete runs but quickly succumbs as his lungs give out from the frigid air.\n\nLambert visits Banner in the hospital and praises her toughness. He visits with Martin and they share grief over the deaths of their daughters. As the film ends, a [[title card]] states that missing persons statistics are kept for every demographic group except [[Missing and murdered Indigenous women|Native American women]], whose numbers remain unknown.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as Cory Lambert, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent.
