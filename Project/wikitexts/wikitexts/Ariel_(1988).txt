One of the miners, Taisto Kasurinen (Turo Pajala), finds himself freshly out of work, sitting in a cafe with his depressed father. His father gives Taisto the keys to his old white Cadillac convertible right before walking into the men's room, shooting himself. Kasurinen drives the convertible to Southern Finland, where he is promptly mugged and has his life savings stolen. He gets a day-labor job and finds a cheap bed at a nearby hostel.\n\nKasurinen strikes up a romance with Irmeli, a metermaid who was ticketing his car, who quits her job in order to go to dinner with him during her shift. In bed together at her home, they discuss their pasts. Irmeli recounts stories of her ex-husband and Kasurinen tells her that he is from the country, to which she replies, \"that's different.\" He is woken up by Irmeli's young son holding a gun in his face and offering him breakfast.\n\nKasurinen is kicked out of the hostel when he fails to pay for his bed and begins sleeping in his car. In need of money, he reluctantly sells it. He drifts around the city, occasionally smoking cigarette butts left in ashtrays. While sitting in a diner, he spots one of the men who robbed him, chases him, grabs the knife the man pulls out and holds him at knifepoint. The police arrive and Kasurinen is arrested and charged with attempted armed robbery. He is sentenced to nearly two years in jail. As he is leaving the courtroom, he makes eye contact with a distressed Irmeli from across the room.\n\nIn prison, Kasurinen meets his cellmate Mikkonen (Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4). Irmeli and her son visit him regularly. On one visit, Kasurinen proposes marriage to Irmeli, who accepts. Later, Irmeli delivers a birthday cake and a present with a saw inside it to Taisto at the prison. He and Mikkonen use the saw to create a weapon with which to escape. Outside, Kasurinen and Irmeli get married. A series of misadventures ensues as Kasurinen and Mikkonen try to avoid the law and scrape together some money for fake passports by robbing a bank. Mikkonen is fatally wounded after he gets into a dispute over money with the men providing the passports. Taisto buries his friend at a local dump (as was requested) before he uses the fake passport to board a boat to Mexico with Irmeli and her son, hoping to find a better life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Turo Pajala]] as Taisto Kasurinen\n* [[Susanna Haavisto]] as Irmeli\n* [[Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4]] as Mikkonen\n* Eetu Hilkamo as Riku\n* Erkki Pajala as miner\n* Matti Jaaranen as mugger\n* Hannu Viholainen as accomplice\n* Jorma Markkula as tallyman\n* Tarja Kein\u00e4nen as woman in the harbour\n* Eino Kuusela as man on the beach\n}}\n\n== Home media ==\nA digitally restored version of the film was released on DVD by [[The Criterion Collection]] as part of their Eclipse Series.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ariel|url=http://www.criterion.com/films/959-ariel|work=[[The Criterion Collection]]|last=Kaurism\u00e4ki|first=Aki}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0094675}}\n* {{AllMovie title|2815}}\n* {{BBFC title|AZF062093}}\n* {{BFI|4ce2b79d7571e}}\n* {{Elonet title|115894}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|1034135_ariel}}\n* {{Sfdb title|18357}}\n\n{{Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki}}\n{{National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Foreign Language Film}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ariel (Film)}}\n[[Category:1988 films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki]]\n[[Category:1980s Finnish-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s drama road movies]]\n[[Category:Finnish drama films]]\n[[Category:1988 drama films]]"}]}}}}
