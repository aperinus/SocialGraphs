It is a [[sequel]] to ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'' (1986) and was followed by ''[[Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles]]'' (2001). Actors [[Paul Hogan]] and [[Linda Kozlowski]] reprise their roles as [[Mick Dundee]] and Sue Charlton, respectively, here shown opposing a [[Colombian drug cartel]].\n\nThe film was directed by [[John Cornell]] and shot on location in [[New York City]] and [[Northern Territory]], [[Australia]]. It cost $14 million to make.<ref name=budget>[[TV Week]] magazine, 4 June 1988, page 11.  \"Box office war\" by Ivor Davis.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA year has passed since the events of ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'', and Mick Dundee and Susan \"Sue\" Charlton are living happily together in New York. Although Mick's ignorance of city life is a hazard when he attempts to continue his former lifestyle, like [[blast fishing]] in [[Manhattan]]'s waters, Sue's writing has made him a popular public figure. He later goes to work for Leroy Brown, a mild-mannered stationery salesman trying to live up to his self-conceived [[Bad, Bad Leroy Brown|'bad guy in the streets' image]].\n\nWhile working for the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] in [[Colombia]], Sue's ex-husband Bob (mentioned, but not seen, in the first movie) takes photographs of a [[drug cartel]] leader's murder of an unknown person, and is spotted by one of the cartel's sentries. He sends the photographs to Sue before being murdered. Colombian Cartel leader Luis Rico and his brother and top lieutenant, Miguel, go to [[New York City]] to retrieve the photos.\n\nThe gangsters take Sue hostage, leading Mick to ask Leroy for help. Leroy contacts a local street gang, whom Mick asks to create a distraction by caterwauling at the mansion's perimeter, leading most of the cartel's guards on a wild goose chase while Mick rescues Sue. Rico goes into hiding to avoid arrest, and after his henchmen fail a subsequent attempt to kill Sue, Mick decides to take Sue to [[Australia]] to protect themselves on familiar ground. In [[Walkabout Creek]], Mick is enthusiastically welcomed back by friends. After getting provisions, he and Sue take refuge on his personal land, named Belonga Mick ('Mick's Place'; see [[wikt:bilong|bilong]] in [[Tok Pisin]]). Here, Sue discovers that Mick legally owns a large plot of land, including a gold mine.\n\nRico and his men track them to Australia, where they hire some locals to assist, but their [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] tracker abandons them when he hears that their quarry is Mick (the implication being that Mick is a good and respected friend). The gangsters then take Mick's friend Walter as a hostage, but Mick saves his friend by shooting Walter slightly.\n\nWalter convinces the gangsters that Mick's failed attack was because he is the only person suitable to guide them, so they take him as a replacement tracker. He then leads the gangsters on a false trail through the Outback, during which Mick, with the help of his Aboriginal friends he summoned with a [[bullroarer]], manages to reduce the opposition's numbers one by one, leaving the rest increasingly nervous. In the end, he retrieves Walter from Rico and Miguel, leaving the latter to face him alone.\n\nRico sets a [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfire]] in a ploy to corner Mick, but Mick regains the upper hand, captures Rico, and switches clothes with him to lure Miguel into a vulnerable position. Sue, Walter, and Miguel begin shooting at the pair from a distance, mistaking their targets for each other. Walter and Miguel shoot Mick and Rico, respectively, and Rico falls down an [[escarpment]] to his death. Sue shoots and kills Miguel, after which they learn of the clothing switch from one of the aborigines. Sue is relieved to find that Walter's shot has only wounded Mick, and the two embrace. He asks her if she is ready to go home, to which she joyfully replies, \"I ''am'' home.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Paul Hogan]] as [[Michael \"Crocodile\" Dundee|Michael J. \"Crocodile\" Dundee]]\n* [[Linda Kozlowski]] as Susan \"Sue\" Charlton\n* [[John Meillon]] as Walter Reilly\n* Hechter Ubarry as Luis Rico\n* [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez de Alarcon|Juan Fern\u00e1ndez]] as Miguel\n* [[Charles S.
