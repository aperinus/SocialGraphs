Pictures]], becoming the first ''Star Wars'' film to not be distributed by [[20th century Fox|20th Century Fox]]. It is the first fully animated film in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise and takes place shortly after [[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|''Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones'']], at the start of the titular [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]]. In the film, [[Count Dooku]] and [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s uncle Ziro orchestrate a plan to turn Jabba against the [[Galactic Republic]] by framing the [[Jedi]] for the kidnapping of his son. While [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]] and his newly assigned apprentice [[Ahsoka Tano]] attempt to deliver the child back to his father, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] lead separate investigations to uncover Dooku and Ziro's plot.\n\n''The Clone Wars'' premiered on August 10, 2008, at [[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre]], followed by a [[wide release]] five days later. It received largely negative reviews mainly due to its storytelling and animation style, and grossed $68.3&nbsp;million worldwide, making it the lowest-grossing ''Star Wars'' film to date. The film serves as a [[pilot episode]] to the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|television series of the same name]], which premiered on [[Cartoon Network]] two months after the film's release.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the first year of the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]], [[Jedi|Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] and his master, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], lead a small battalion of [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] [[Clone trooper]]s against [[Count Dooku]]'s Separatist droid army on the planet Christophsis. Awaiting reinforcements, the two Jedi greet a shuttle carrying a young Jedi Padawan named [[Ahsoka Tano]], who insists that she has been assigned by Grandmaster [[Yoda]] to serve as Anakin's apprentice. Initially reluctant, Ahsoka earns Anakin's respect after the two succeed in deactivating the Separatists' energy field while Obi-Wan stalls the droid army commander, allowing a Republic victory.\n\nFollowing the battle, Yoda arrives and informs the Jedi that gangster [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s son Rotta has been kidnapped. The kidnapping has been planned by Dooku's [[Sith]] master [[Darth Sidious]], who hopes to blame the Jedi for Rotta's kidnapping in order to get Jabba to ally with the Separatists and fuel anti-Jedi sentiment from the Hutts. Anakin and Ahsoka are tasked with retrieving the Huttlet, while Obi-Wan is sent to [[Tatooine]] to negotiate with Jabba over a potential treaty between the Hutts and the Republic. Anakin and Ahsoka track the kidnapper and Rotta to the planet Teth, where they are ambushed by Separatist forces led by Count Dooku's assassin and former Jedi [[Asajj Ventress]]. The Jedi manage to escape along with [[R2-D2]] and hijack a derelict transport, which they use to travel to Tatooine. Obi-Wan, alerted by Anakin, arrives on Teth and engages Ventress in a [[lightsaber]] duel. Though Obi-Wan manages to defeat her, Ventress escapes, knowing she has failed.\n\nMeanwhile, Anakin's wife Senator [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] learns of her husband's mission. Fearing for his safety, she confronts Jabba's uncle [[Ziro the Hutt|Ziro]] on [[Coruscant]]. Ziro refuses to cooperate, apparently believing that it is the Jedi who are responsible for the situation. However, she soon discovers that Ziro has actually conspired with Dooku to have Rotta killed, so that Jabba would execute Anakin and Ahsoka, leading to his arrest by the Jedi Council, allowing Ziro to seize power over the Hutt Clan. Padm\u00e9 is captured and imprisoned, but a chance call by [[C-3PO]] enables her to summon a squadron of clone troopers, and Ziro is arrested, despite revealing Dooku threatened to execute him if he did not cooperate with the conspiracy.\n\nArriving on Tatooine, Anakin devises a ruse to confront Dooku carrying a fake Rotta, while Ahsoka takes the real Rotta to Jabba's palace. While Anakin fights off Dooku, Ahsoka is ambushed by the MagnaGuards, whom she defeats with ease. The two deliver Rotta safely to Jabba, who nonetheless orders the Jedi to be executed for their supposed kidnapping attempt. However, Padm\u00e9 contacts Jabba in time and reveals Ziro and the Separatists' responsibility for the kidnapping. Acknowledging the Jedi's heroism and allowing the Republic to have Ziro punished for his crimes, Jabba, in gratitude, agrees to the treaty before Anakin and Ahsoka are picked up by Obi-Wan and Yoda. Meanwhile, Dooku reports the plot's failure to Darth Sidious, who assures him that the tide of the war is still in their favor.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{main|List of Star Wars characters|List of Star Wars: The Clone Wars cast members}}\n* [[Matt Lanter]] as [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]], a former Jedi Padawan who has recently been promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight, and a general in the Republic's army, who leads the 501st Legion.
