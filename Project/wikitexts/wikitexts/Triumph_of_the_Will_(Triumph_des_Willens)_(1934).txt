[[Adolf Hitler]] commissioned the film and served as an unofficial [[executive producer]]; his name appears in the opening titles. It chronicles the 1934 [[Nuremberg Rally|Nazi Party Congress]] in [[Nuremberg]], which was attended by more than 700,000 Nazi supporters.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Barsam | first = Richard M | title = Filmguide to Triumph of the Will | publisher = Indiana University Press | year = 1975 | location = Bloomington, IN | pages = 21 }}</ref> The film contains excerpts of speeches given by [[List of Nazi Party leaders and officials|Nazi leaders]] at the Congress, including Hitler, [[Rudolf Hess]] and [[Julius Streicher]], interspersed with footage of massed [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA) and [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS) troops and public reaction. Its overriding theme is the return of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] as a [[great power]] with Hitler as its leader. The film was produced after the [[Night of the Long Knives]] and many formerly prominent SA members are absent.\n\nFollowing its release in March 1935, it became a major example of film used as propaganda and was well-received at home. Riefenstahl's techniques\u2014such as moving cameras, [[aerial photography]], the use of [[long-focus lens]]es to create a distorted [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], and the revolutionary approach to the use of music and [[cinematography]]\u2014have earned ''Triumph of the Will'' recognition as one of the greatest propaganda films in history. She won several awards in Germany, France and Italy.{{sfn|Rother|2003|p=71}}\n\nDuring [[World War II]], [[Frank Capra]]'s seven-film series ''[[Why We Fight]]'' was [[Why We Fight#Countering enemy propaganda films|directly inspired]] by ''Triumph of the Will'' and the United States' response to it.<ref name=\"Triumph of the Will \">{{Cite web |url=http://www.albany.edu/writers-inst/webpages4/filmnotes/fns07n6.html |title=Triumph of the Will \u2013 Film Notes |last=Hagopian |first=Kevin Jack |website=New York Writers Institute |publisher=University of Albany}}\"When director Frank Capra was commissioned by the U.S. government to make what became the Why We Fight series of propaganda films in World War II, he screened a copy of Triumph of the Will which had been setd by the U.S. Customs office.\"</ref> In present-day Germany, the film is not censored but the courts commonly classify it as [[Nazi propaganda]], which requires an educational context for public screenings.<ref>Julia Jacobs, Philipp Schepp: \"''Triumph des Willens''{{-\"}}.

It is the only commentary in the entire film.\n\n'''Day 1''': The film opens with shots of the clouds above the city, and then moves through the clouds to float above the assembling masses below, with the intention of portraying beauty and majesty of the scene. The cruciform shadow of Hitler's plane is visible as it passes over the tiny figures marching below, accompanied by an orchestral arrangement of the ''[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]''. Upon arriving at the Nuremberg airport, Hitler and other Nazi leaders emerge from his plane to thunderous applause and a cheering crowd. He is then driven into Nuremberg, through equally enthusiastic people, to his hotel where a night rally is later held.\n\n'''Day 2''': The second day begins with images of Nuremberg at dawn, accompanied by an extract from the Act III Prelude (''Wach Auf!'') of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg]]''. Following this is a [[Montage sequence|montage]] of the attendees preparing for the opening of the Reich Party Congress, and footage of the top Nazi officials arriving at the [[Nazi party rally grounds#Luitpoldarena|Luitpold Arena]]. The film then cuts to the opening ceremony, where [[Rudolf Hess]] announces the start of the Congress. The camera then introduces much of the Nazi hierarchy and covers their opening speeches, including [[Joseph Goebbels]], [[Alfred Rosenberg]], [[Hans Frank]], [[Fritz Todt]], [[Robert Ley]] and [[Julius Streicher]]. Then the film cuts to an outdoor rally for the ''[[Reichsarbeitsdienst]]'' (Labor Service), which is primarily a series of quasi-military drills by men carrying spades. This is also where Hitler gives his first speech on the merits of the Labour Service and praising them for their work in rebuilding Germany. The day then ends with a torchlight [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] parade and fireworks display in which [[Viktor Lutze]] speaks to the crowds.\n\n'''Day 3''': The third day starts with a [[Hitler Youth]] rally on the parade ground. Again the camera covers the Nazi dignitaries arriving and the introduction of Hitler by [[Baldur von Schirach]]. Hitler then addresses the Youth, describing in [[militarism|militaristic]] terms how they must harden themselves and prepare for sacrifice. Everyone present, including General [[Werner von Blomberg]], then assemble for a military pass and review, featuring [[Wehrmacht]] cavalry and various armored vehicles. That night Hitler delivers another speech to low-ranking party officials by torchlight, commemorating the first year since the Nazis took power and declaring that the party and state are one entity.\n\n'''Day 4''': The fourth day is the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of the film, where the most memorable of the imagery is presented. Hitler, flanked by [[Heinrich Himmler]] and Viktor Lutze, walks through a long wide expanse with over 150,000 [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] troops standing at attention, to lay a wreath at a First World War memorial. Hitler then reviews the parading SA and SS men, following which Hitler and Lutze deliver a speech where they discuss the [[Night of the Long Knives]] purge of the SA several months prior. Lutze reaffirms the SA's loyalty to the regime, and Hitler absolves the SA of any crimes committed by [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]]. New party flags are consecrated by letting them touch the ''[[Blutfahne]]'' (the same cloth flag said to have been carried by the fallen Nazis during the [[Beer Hall Putsch]]) and, following a final parade in front of the [[Nuremberg Frauenkirche]], Hitler delivers his closing speech. In it he reaffirms the primacy of the Nazi Party in Germany, declaring, \"All loyal Germans will become National Socialists. Only the best National Socialists are party comrades!\" Hess then leads the assembled crowd in a final ''[[Sieg Heil]]'' salute for Hitler, marking the close of the party congress. The entire crowd sings the ''Horst-Wessel-Lied'' as the camera focuses on the giant Swastika banner, which fades into a line of silhouetted men in Nazi party uniforms, marching in formation as the lyrics \"Comrades shot by the Red Front and the Reactionaries march in spirit together in our columns\" are sung.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R99035, Adolf Hitler und Leni Riefenstahl crop.jpg|thumb|Hitler congratulates Riefenstahl in 1934]]\n\nRiefenstahl, a popular German actress, had directed her first film called ''[[Das blaue Licht]]'' (''The Blue Light'') in 1932.{{sfn|Rother|2003|p=35}} Hitler was impressed with ''Das blaue Licht'', and in 1933 asked her to direct a film about the Nazis' annual [[Nuremberg Rally]], which became ''[[Der Sieg des Glaubens]]'' (''The Victory of Faith'').{{sfn|Rother|2003|p=51}} Hitler chose Riefenstahl as he wanted the film as \"artistically satisfying\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Starkman|first=R|year=1998|page=23|title=Mother of All Spectacles: Ray M\u00fcller's \"The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl\"|journal=Film Quarterly|volume=51|number=2 Winter, 1997\u20131998|publisher=University of California|jstor=3697138|doi=10.2307/3697138}}{{subscription required | date= April 2012}}</ref> as possible to appeal to a non-political audience, but he also believed that propaganda must admit no element of doubt.<ref name=\"PS2\">{{cite book|chapter=War Propaganda|last=Hitler|first=Adolph|title=Primary Sources 2: Interwar and World War II|year=2000|editor1-last=Marwick|editor1-first=A|editor2-last=Simpson|editor2-first=W|publisher=Milton Keynes, The Open University|pages=79\u201382|isbn=0-7492-8559-1}}</ref>\n\n''The Victory of Faith'' faced numerous technical problems, including a lack of preparation (Riefenstahl reported having just a few days) and Hitler's apparent unease at being filmed.{{sfn|Rother|2003|p=55}} Though the film apparently did well at the box office, it later became a serious embarrassment to the Nazis after SA Leader Ernst R\u00f6hm, who had a prominent role in the film, was executed during the Night of the Long Knives. All references to R\u00f6hm were ordered to be erased from German history, which included the destruction of all copies of ''The Victory of Faith''.

Ruttmann's ideals departed significantly from ''The Victory of Faith'' and sought to reorient the focus of the film onto the history of the Nazi movement rather than Hitler himself.{{sfn|Rother|2003|p=62}} Hitler visited the studio on 6 December 1934 and permanently removed Ruttmann from the project, leaving Riefenstahl in sole control of what would become ''Triumph des Willens'' (''Triumph of the Will'').{{sfn|Rother|2003|p=63}}\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-0312-503, N\u00fcrnberg, Reichsparteitag, Marsch der Wehrmacht.jpg|thumb|Riefenstahl and her film crew in front of Hitler's car during a parade in Nuremberg]]\n\nThe film follows a script similar to ''The Victory of Faith'' which is evident when one sees both films side by side.

Pits were dug in front of the speakers' platform so Riefenstahl could get the camera angles she wanted, and tracks were laid so that her cameramen could get traveling shots of the crowd.

Within two months the film had earned 815,000 [[German Reichsmark|Reichsmark]] (equivalent to {{Inflation|DE|0.815|1933}} million {{Inflation-year|DE}} euros), and Ufa considered it one of the three most profitable films of that year. Hitler praised the film as being an \"incomparable glorification of the power and beauty of our Movement.\" For her efforts, Riefenstahl was rewarded with the German Film Prize (''Deutscher Filmpreis''), a gold medal at the 1935 [[Venice Biennale]], and the Grand Prix at the 1937 [[World Exhibition]] in [[Paris]]. However, there were few claims that the film would result in a mass influx of \"[[converts]]\" to [[fascism]] and the Nazis apparently did not make a serious effort to promote the film outside of Germany. Film historian Richard Taylor also said that ''Triumph of the Will'' was not generally used for propaganda purposes inside Nazi Germany. ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote in 2003: \"''Triumph of the Will'' seduced many wise men and women, persuaded them to admire rather than to despise, and undoubtedly won the Nazis friends and allies all over the world.\"<ref name=\"the independent\">{{cite news |first= Val|last= Williams|page=xx |title=Leni Riefenstahl |date=10 September 2003 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |department=Obituaries |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/leni-riefenstahl-548728.html |url-status= dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830045819/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/leni-riefenstahl-548728.html |archive-date=2009-08-30}}</ref>\n\nThe reception in other countries was not always as enthusiastic. British documentarian [[Paul Rotha]] called it tedious, while others were repelled by its pro-Nazi sentiments. During World War II, [[Frank Capra]] helped to create a direct response, through the film series called ''[[Why We Fight]]'', a series of newsreels commissioned by the United States government that spliced in footage from ''Triumph of the Will'', but recontextualized it so that it promoted the cause of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] instead. Capra later remarked that ''Triumph of the Will'' \"fired no gun, dropped no bombs. But as a [[Psychology|psychological]] weapon aimed at destroying the will to resist, it was just as lethal.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Capra|first=Frank|author-link=Frank Capra|title=The Name above the Title: An Autobiography|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1977|page=328|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x_E09IWRomMC&pg=PA328|isbn=0-306-80771-8|access-date=6 May 2012}}</ref> Clips from ''Triumph of the Will'' were also used in an Allied propaganda short called ''[[General Adolph Takes Over]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/lambeth-walk-nazi-style-1942/ |title=Lambeth Walk \u2013 Nazi Style (1942) |publisher=The Public Domain Review |access-date=22 January 2019}}</ref> set to the British dance tune \"[[The Lambeth Walk]]\". The legions of marching soldiers, as well as Hitler giving his Nazi salute, were made to look like wind-up dolls, dancing to the music.

W. Griffith]]'s ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'', ''Triumph of the Will'' has been criticized as a use of spectacular filmmaking to promote a profoundly [[unethical]] system. In her defense, Riefenstahl claimed that she was na\u00efve about the Nazis when she made it and had no knowledge of Hitler's [[genocidal]] or [[anti-semitic]] policies. She also pointed out that ''Triumph of the Will'' contains \"not one single anti-semitic word\", although it does contain a veiled comment by [[Julius Streicher]] that \"a people that does not protect its racial purity will perish\".\n\nHowever, [[Roger Ebert]] has observed that for some, \"the very absence of anti-semitism in ''Triumph of the Will'' looks like a calculation; excluding the central motif of almost all of Hitler's public speeches must have been a deliberate decision to make the film more efficient as propaganda.\"<ref name=\"Ebert_1994\">{{Cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | author-link = Roger Ebert | title = The Wonderful Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl | newspaper = Chicago Sun-Times | date = 24 June 1994 | url = https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-wonderful-horrible-life-of-leni-riefenstahl-1994 }}</ref>\n\nRiefenstahl said in 1964:\n\n{{blockquote|If you see this film again today you ascertain that it doesn't contain a single reconstructed scene.

The idea that I helped to plan it is downright absurd.\" Ebert states that ''Triumph of the Will'' is \"by general consent [one] of the best documentaries ever made\", but added that because it reflects the ideology of a movement regarded by many as [[evil]], it poses \"a classic question of the contest between art and morality: Is there such a thing as pure art, or does all art make a political statement?\"<ref name=\"Ebert_1994\"/> When reviewing the film for his \"Great Movies\" collection, Ebert reversed his opinion, characterizing his earlier conclusion as \"the received opinion that the film is great but evil\" and calling it \"a terrible film, paralyzingly dull, simpleminded, overlong and not even 'manipulative', because it is too clumsy to manipulate anyone but a true believer\".<ref name=\"Ebert_2008\">{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080626%2FREVIEWS08%2F911177318%2F1023 |title=Triumph of the Will (1935) |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=26 June 2008 |access-date=12 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406112429/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080626%2FREVIEWS08%2F911177318%2F1023 |archive-date=6 April 2011 |author-link=Roger Ebert |last=Ebert |first=Roger |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWriting in 1975, [[Susan Sontag]] considers ''Triumph of the Will'' the \"most successful, most purely propagandistic film ever made, whose very conception negates the possibility of the filmmaker's having an aesthetic or visual conception independent of propaganda.\" Sontag points to Riefenstahl's involvement in the planning and design of the Nuremberg ceremonies as evidence that Riefenstahl was working as a propagandist, rather than as an artist in any sense of the word. With some 30 cameras and a crew of 150, the marches, parades, speeches, and processions were orchestrated like a movie set for Riefenstahl's film. Further, this was not the first political film made by Riefenstahl for the Nazis (there was ''Victory of Faith'', 1933), nor was it the last (''[[Day of Freedom]]'', 1935, and ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]'', 1938). \"Anyone who defends Riefenstahl's films as documentary\", Sontag states, \"if documentary is to be distinguished from propaganda, is being disingenuous. In ''Triumph of Will'', the document (the image) is no longer simply the record of reality; 'reality' has been constructed to serve the image.\"<ref name=\"Sontag_1975\"/>  This is considerably different from the position she takes ten years earlier in a 1965 essay entitled \"On Style,\" where she opposes the idea that Riefenstahl's propaganda films are purely propaganda, and writes:  \"To call Leni Riefenstahl's ''The Triumph of the Will'' and ''The Olympiad'' masterpieces is not to gloss over Nazi propaganda with aesthetic lenience.  The Nazi propaganda is there.  But something else is there, too, which we reject at our loss.  Because they project the complex movements of intelligence and grace and sensuousness, these two films of Riefenstahl (unique among works of Nazi artists) transcend the categories of propaganda or even reportage.  And we find ourselves&mdash;to be sure, rather uncomfortably&mdash;seeing 'Hitler' and not Hitler, the '1936 Olympics' and not the 1936 Olympics.
