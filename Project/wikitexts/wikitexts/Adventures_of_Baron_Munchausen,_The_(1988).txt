In a theatre box, the mayor, \"The Right Ordinary Horatio Jackson\", reinforces the city's commitment to reason by ordering the execution of a soldier who had just accomplished a near-superhuman feat of bravery, claiming that his bravery is demoralizing to other soldiers and citizens.\n\nNot far into the play, an elderly man claiming to be the real Baron interrupts the show, protesting its many inaccuracies. Over the complaints of the audience, the theatre company and Jackson, the \"real\" Baron gains the house's attention and narrates through flashback an account of one of his adventures, of a life-or-death wager with the Grand Turk, where the younger Baron's life is saved only by his amazing luck plus the assistance of his remarkable associates: Berthold, the world's fastest runner; Adolphus, a rifleman with superhuman eyesight; Gustavus, who possesses extraordinary hearing, and sufficient lung power to knock down an army by exhaling; and the fantastically strong Albrecht.\n\nWhen gunfire disrupts the elderly Baron's story, Jackson cancels the acting troupe's contract because of the Baron. The Baron wanders backstage, where the [[Death (personification)|Angel of Death]] tries to take his life, but Sally Salt, the young daughter of the theater company's leader, saves him and persuades him to remain living. Sally races to the wall yelling for the Turkish army to go away, and the Baron accidentally fires himself through the sky using a mortar and returns riding a cannonball, narrowly escaping the Angel of Death once again. Insisting that he alone can save the city, the Baron escapes over the city's walls in a hot air balloon constructed of women's underwear, accompanied by Sally as a stowaway.\n\nThe balloon expedition proceeds to the Moon, where the Baron, who has grown younger, finds his old associate Berthold, but angers the King of the Moon ([[Robin Williams]] in an uncredited role), a giant with separate minds in his head and body, who resents the Baron for his romantic past with the Queen of the Moon. The death of the King's body, and a bungled escape from the Moon, brings the trio back to the Earth, and into the volcano of the Roman god [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]]. He hosts the group as his guests and reveals Albrecht is working as his servant. The Baron and Vulcan's wife, the Goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], attempt a romantic interlude by waltzing in the air, but this cuts short the hospitality and Vulcan expels the foursome from his kingdom into the South Seas.\n\nSwallowed by an enormous sea creature, the travellers locate Gustavus, Adolphus, and the Baron's trusty horse [[Bucephalus]]. The Baron (who again appears elderly after being \"expelled from a state of bliss\") encounters the Angel of Death for the fourth time. Finally they escape by blowing \"a modicum of snuff\" out into the sea creature's cavernous interior, causing it to sneeze the heroes out through its whale-like blowhole. The Baron, young once again, sails to where the Turkish army is located but the Baron's associates are too elderly and tired to fight.\n\nThe Baron lectures them firmly but to no avail, and he storms off intending to surrender to the Grand Turk. His companions rally to save the Baron, and through a series of fantastic acts they rout the Turkish army away and liberate the city. During the city's celebratory parade, the Baron is shot dead by Jackson and the Angel of Death appears a final time to take the Baron's life. An emotional public funeral takes place, but the denouement reveals that this is merely the final scene of yet another story the Baron is telling to the same theater-goers in the city. The Baron calls the foregoing \"only one of the many occasions on which I met my death\" and closes his tale by saying \"everyone who had a talent for it lived happily ever after\".\n\nThe Baron leads the citizens to the city gates to reveal the city has indeed been saved, though it is unclear if the events of the battle occurred in a story or in reality. Sally asks, \"It wasn't just a story, was it?\" The Baron grins, rides off on Bucephalus, and then disappears.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits --->\n{{cast list|\n* [[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]] as [[Baron Munchausen]]\n* [[Eric Idle]] as Berthold/Desmond\n* [[Sarah Polley]] as Sally Salt\n* [[Oliver Reed]] as [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]]\n* [[Charles McKeown]] as Adolphus/Rupert\n* Winston Dennis as Albrecht/Bill\n* [[Jack Purvis (actor)|Jack Purvis]] as Gustavus/Jeremy\n* [[Valentina Cortese]] as Queen Ariadne/Violet\n* [[Jonathan Pryce]] as The Right Ordinary Horatio Jackson\n* [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]] as Henry Salt\n* [[Peter Jeffrey]] as Sultan [[Mahmud I]]\n* [[Uma Thurman]] as [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]/Rose\n* [[Alison Steadman]] as Daisy\n* [[Ray Cooper]] as [[Functionary]]\n}}\n\nIn addition, [[Robin Williams]]{{snd}}credited as \"Ray D.

The tales were further embellished and translated back to German by [[Gottfried August B\u00fcrger]] in 1786. These tales were frequently extended and translated throughout the 19th century, further fictionalized in the 1901 American novel ''[[Mr. Munchausen]]''.\n\nThe stories were adapted into various films including ''[[Baron Munchausen's Dream]]'' (1911, [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]]), ''[[M\u00fcnchhausen (film)|M\u00fcnchhausen]]'' (1943, [[Josef von B\u00e1ky]] with script by [[Erich K\u00e4stner]]), ''[[The Fabulous Baron Munchausen]]'' (1961, [[Karel Zeman]]), and ''[[The Very Same Munchhausen]]'' (1979) directed by [[Mark Zakharov]], who depicted Munchausen as a tragic character, struggling against the conformity and hypocrisy of the world around him.\n\n===Budget===\nThe film was over budget; what was originally $23.5 million<ref>{{cite news|first1=Michael|last1=Cieply|first2=Jack|last2=Mathews|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-14/entertainment/ca-36259_1|title= The Misadventures of 'Munchausen' : How a $23.5-Million Fantasy Film Turned into an Over-Budget Nightmare |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=14 January 1988|access-date=30 October 2010}}</ref> grew to a reported $46.63 million.<ref name=\"mojo\"/> Gilliam, acknowledging he had gone over budget, said its final costs had been nowhere near $40 million.<ref>Interview for ''The Directors \u2013 The Films of Terry Gilliam'', included on the bonus DVD of the 25th Anniversary Edition of ''[[Time Bandits]]'')</ref>\n\nIn ''The Madness and Misadventures of Munchausen'' (included on the bonus DVD of the 20th Anniversary Edition of ''Munchausen''), producer Thomas Sch\u00fchly said that as part of a deal with 20th Century Fox before it ended up with Columbia, a budget plan had been set up for $35 million, \"and it's strange, the ''[film's]'' final cost was 35 ''[million]''. ... We always had a budget of 34 or 35 million, the problem was when I started to discuss it with Columbia, Columbia would not go beyond 25. ... Everybody knew from the very beginning that this cutting out was just a fake. ... The problem was that [[David Puttnam]] got fired, and all these deals were oral deals. ... Columbia's new CEO, [[Dawn Steel]], said 'Whatever David Puttnam ''[has]'' said before doesn't interest me'\".\n\nRegarding the new regime's apparent animosity towards all of Puttnam's projects and ''Munchausen'', Gilliam added in the same documentary, \"I was trying very hard to convince Dawn Steel that this was not a David Puttnam movie, it was a Terry Gilliam movie.\" Similarly Kent Houston, head of Peerless Camera doing the film's special effects, said in ''Madness and Misadventures'' that they were promised a bonus if they would finish the effects in time, but when they approached the person again when they were done, he was met with the reply, \"I'm not gonna pay you, because I don't want to seem to be doing anything that could benefit Terry Gilliam.\"\n\n===Experience===\n''Munchausen'' is the third entry in Gilliam's \"''Trilogy of Imagination''\", preceded by ''[[Time Bandits]]'' (1981) and ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' (1985).<ref>Matthews, Jack (1996). \"Dreaming Brazil\" essay accompanying [[The Criterion Collection]] DVD</ref> All are about the \"craziness of our awkwardly ordered society and the desire to escape it through whatever means possible.\"<ref name=\"essay\">Matthews, Jack (1996). \"Dreaming Brazil\" (essay accompanying [[The Criterion Collection]] DVD release).</ref> Gilliam explains that, \"The one theme that runs through all three of these pictures is a consistently serious battle between fantasy and what people perceive as reality.\"<ref name=\"Journal\">{{cite journal|first1=Paul M.|last1=Sammon|first2=Don|last2=Shay|title=The Adventures of Terry Gilliam|journal=[[Cinefex]]|volume=38|issue=7|date=1989}}</ref> All three films focus on these struggles and attempts to escape them through imagination: ''Time Bandits'', through the eyes of a child, ''Brazil'', through the eyes of a man in his thirties, and ''Munchausen'', through the eyes of an elderly man.<ref name=\"essay\" />\n\nWhen the production finally came to a successful closure, several of the actors commented on the rushed tightness of the whole project.

Fellini is a wilder liar, but that's the only difference! Terry isn't a director so much as a film author. He is open to every single idea and opportunity to make the end result work.

It was a bit like the new lion that comes in and kills all the cubs from the previous man.\"\n\nIn a 2000 interview with [[IGN]], Gilliam said about the contemporary press perception of the film being a financial disaster how \"It seemed actually appropriate that Munchausen\u2014the greatest liar in the world\u2014should be a victim of some of the greatest liars in the world.\" He compared the film's budget problems to the even more serious problems of ''[[We're No Angels (1989 film)|We're No Angels]]'' that commonly go unmentioned, and he went on to declare its difficulties as a mixture of \"trade press\" still being upset about Gilliam's battle with Universal over ''Brazil'', [[nepotism]], and an intrigue on behalf of [[Ray Stark]] successfully trying to have Puttnam removed from Columbia, coupled with the fact the studio was being sold at the time:\n\n<blockquote>The negative stories about the shoot that were turning up in the Hollywood press were coming, we found out later, from a source at Film Finances\u2014which was the completion bond company on the film. Their lawyer was a guy named Steve Ransohoff, whose father was Martin Ransohoff\u2014who was Ray Stark's friend and partner. [...] I thought it was quite extraordinary, because the stories were doing two things\u2014they were making me and the whole project look like it was completely out of control and all my fault, and that Film Finance, the completion guarantors, were the only thing holding it together\u2014the people trying to bring control to it... the fact was, they were absolutely useless.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The ultimate fact was that when the film was ultimately released, there were only 117 prints made for America\u2014so it was never really released. 117 prints! ...an art film gets 400. We were ultimately the victim of Columbia Tri-Star being sold to Sony, because at that time all they were doing was trying to get the books looking as good as possible. We weren't the only film that suffered, but we were the most visible one. And what happened\u2014to complete the story in a neat and tidy way\u2014was that they were not spending any money on advertising to promote any of the movies started by the previous regime\u2014by Putnam's regime. They were burying films left right and center by spending no money on them\u2014and the books looked really good at the end of that.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The joke is, if you look back, we got the best reviews and we were doing the best business in the opening weeks of any film they had released since ''[[The Last Emperor|Last Emperor]]''. We actually opened well in the big cities\u2014we opened really well. A friend who had bought the video rights said he had never seen anything so weird\u2014Columbia was spending their whole time looking at exit polls to prove the film would not work in the suburbs, and so it would be pointless to make any more prints. He said, \"I've never seen anything like this.\" There it was.
