It stars [[Marsha Mason]], [[Jason Robards]] in the titular role, [[Donald Sutherland]], and [[Matthew Broderick]] (in his film debut).\n\nIt is the last of five Simon-Ross collaborations, as well as the last of Simon's films starring Mason (his wife at the time).\n\n== Plot ==\nWidowed high school English teacher Nora McPhee lives with her 15-year-old son, Michael, in a broken down house in [[Venice, Los Angeles]]. One night, her long-lost father, Max Dugan, appears at her door; she initially does not recognize him, as he went to prison when she was only 9 years old, and disappeared after serving 6 years. He explains that he is dying within the year, and wants to give her and Michael the $687,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.687|1983|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) he managed to embezzle from a Las Vegas casino after they appropriated his property, worth that same amount.\n\nNora meets police detective Brian Costello when her car is stolen and they soon start dating. Nora and her (possible) father conceal his identity from Michael and Brian, with Dugan telling Michael that he knew \"Max\" in prison{{snd}}then tells Nora the same, further obfuscating what she can believe.\n\nThough Nora rejects his money, only wanting his presence in her life, Max continues buying extravagant cars, appliances, and renovations for her and Michael, making it harder for her to hide the truth from an increasingly suspicious Brian. Busybody neighbor Mrs. Litke complicates things by continuously reporting things to the police.\n\nAfter two weeks together, Nora is now sure that it truly is her father. She pleads with Max to turn himself in, confident that the police will take the money and release him to her care for his final few months. Instead, he leaves a message that he is fleeing to Brazil with part of the money, leaving the rest for them.\n\nBrian stops Nora as she heads to Michael's baseball game. He has figured out who Max is, and that he is dying, and warns her that she could face prison time unless she turns Max in. Nora refuses to do anything until after the game. After Michael hits the game winning home run{{snd}}his first hit of the season, thanks to training from MLB coach [[Charley Lau]], paid for by Max{{snd}}Nora finally tells Brian everything. She also convinces him that Max is unimportant, and that the off-duty Brian can call in the information after lunch. Max is seen driving away, apparently headed for Brazil.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Marsha Mason]] as Nora McPhee\n* [[Jason Robards]] as Max Dugan\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Brian Costello\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as Michael McPhee\n* [[Dody Goodman]] as Mrs. Litke\n* [[Sal Viscuso]] as Coach Roy\n* [[Panchito Gomez]] as Luis\n* [[Charley Lau]] as himself\n* [[Aaron Sheridan]] as Vans Taylor\n* [[Brian Part]] as Kevin Costello\n* [[Tom Spratley]] as Truck Washer\n}}\nAdditionally, [[Kiefer Sutherland]] (in his film debut) briefly appears as Bill, Mike's school friend.\n\n==Production notes==\n''Max Dugan Returns'' marks the first of only three times (as of 2022) that [[Donald Sutherland]] and his son [[Kiefer Sutherland|Kiefer]] have appeared together in a dramatic film project, the others being ''[[A Time to Kill (1996 film)|A Time to Kill]]'' and ''[[Forsaken (2015 film)|Forsaken]]'', in the latter of which they both starred in the leads.\n\n[[Matthew Broderick]] was cast in this film and Simon's play ''[[Brighton Beach Memoirs]]'' simultaneously.\n\nThe real-life father of Matthew Broderick, noted character actor [[James Broderick]] (whose birthname is James Joseph Broderick III), died on November 1, 1982 {{snd}} around the time of the making of this film. Co-star [[Jason Robards]], who knew James and was a friend, helped Matthew through his grief over the loss of his father.\n\nFormer professional baseball player [[Charley Lau]] appears as himself having been hired by Robards' character Dugan to coach Broderick's Michael to hit better for his high school team. At the time of the movie, Lau was the hitting coach for the [[Chicago White Sox]].\n\nThis was the last motion picture that Mason and Simon collaborated on before their divorce.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, calling it \"watchable and sort of sweet.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/max-dugan-returns-1983 |title=Max Dugan Returns |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert|date=March 28, 1983 |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|via=[[RogerEbert.com]] |accessdate=March 31, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n[[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' also awarded 2.5 stars out of 4 and wrote: {{cquote|This sort of story is the kind of whimsical comedy that would have been made and made memorably in the '30s or '40s. But in this version only Robards has that old style panache to carry it off. He plays Max Dugan seriously, not as a clown, and it works beautifully. Other actors might have had fun with the part; Robards may have realized that there would be enough jokes happening around him that he didn't need to be silly. Mason, to her credit, manages to keep her whiny, please-love-me stereotypical movie persona in check; she's almost believable here. as a teacher. Young Matthew Broderick is just fine as the son. Donald Sutherland also appears in the film as Mason's love interest, and more than his performance we notice simply that writer Simon has cared enough about the script to include Sutherland's character as a tension source. \"Max Dugan Returns\" is by no means without the trademark Simon touches that can cause one to wince. Wisecrack piles on top of wisecrack in some scenes to the point that you can't see any of the characters. And the film's ending is so predictable that you will be putting on your coat at least two or three minutes before the end credits start to roll.<ref>{{cite news|first=Gene|last=Siskel|authorlink=Gene Siskel|date=March 28, 1983|title='Max Dugan Returns': Robards an island of sanity in a sea of Simon silliness|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref>}} \n[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"Mr. Simon's original screenplay is fast and buoyant, and Herbert Ross's direction shows off the abundant jokes to their best possible advantage. There are certainly some questionable ingredients to the story, but you're not likely to notice them while the film is under way. You're likely to be laughing.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Janet|last=Maslin|authorlink=Janet Maslin|date=March 25, 1983|title=Film: 'Dugan Returns'|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the film as \"a consistently happy comedic fable which should please romanticists drawn again to another teaming of Neil Simon, Marsha Mason and Herbert Ross.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Film Reviews: Max Dugan Returns|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 23, 1983}}</ref>\n\n[[David Ansen]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'' wrote, \"It's a cute fantasy, and the players are certainly appealing. But Simon overplays his hand. Having created living and breathing comic characters, he starts to suffocate them inside an increasingly mechanized plot.
