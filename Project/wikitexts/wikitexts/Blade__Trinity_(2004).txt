Goyer]], who also wrote the screenplays to ''[[Blade (1998 film)|Blade]]'' and ''[[Blade II]]''. It stars [[Wesley Snipes]] as [[Blade (New Line franchise character)|Blade]], based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Character (arts)|character]] [[Blade (character)|of the same name]], who also produced with Goyer, Peter Frankfurt and [[Lynn Harris]], with a supporting cast of [[Ryan Reynolds]], [[Jessica Biel]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Dominic Purcell]], [[Parker Posey]] and [[Triple H]] in his acting debut.\n\nThe third and final installment in the [[Blade (franchise)|''Blade'' trilogy]], the war between humans and vampires continues. Blade has been framed for numerous murders by the vampire leader Danica Talos, who is determined to lead her bloodthirsty compatriots to victory. Blade must team up with a band of rogue [[vampire hunter]]s to save humanity from his most challenging enemy yet: [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]].\n\n''Blade: Trinity'' was released in the United States on December 8, 2004. The film grossed $132 million at the box office worldwide on a budget of $65 million and received mostly negative reviews from critics for its formulaic themes, directing and acting; it is the worst-reviewed film in the trilogy. The film was followed by 2006's ''[[Blade: The Series]]'', and also marks Reynolds' first superhero role, as well as his first collaboration with Marvel Entertainment. Marvel regained the film rights to the character in 2012.\n\n==Plot==\nA small group of [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampires]] investigate an ancient tomb in the [[Syrian Desert]], which they believe belongs to [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]], the first vampire. To keep [[Blade (New Line franchise character)|Blade]] from interfering, they frame him for the murder of a human [[Familiar spirit|familiar]]. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents subsequently locate Blade's hideout and kill his mentor and friend, [[Abraham Whistler]]. Demoralized, Blade surrenders and is arrested.\n\nThe vampires' familiars have arranged for the authorities to turn Blade over to them. He is rescued by [[Hannibal King]] and Abigail Whistler, Abraham's daughter, who invite Blade to join their band of vampire hunters, the [[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]. From them, Blade learns that Danica Talos, an old enemy of King, has revived Dracula, or \"Drake\", with the goal of using his powers to cure vampires of their weaknesses. As the first of the vampires, Drake is able to survive in sunlight. Along with newly-innovative [[ultraviolet]] \"[[Sun dog]]\" ammunition, the Nightstalkers have created an experimental bioweapon known as Daystar, capable of killing vampires at the genetic level. However, they need a purer blood source to make it effective. As Drake is too powerful to kill via normal means, they hope that the virus will kill him and, with his blood in the mix, ensure the rest of the species is wiped out; but also fear that this will include Blade.\n\nEager to test Blade, Drake isolates him from the Nightstalkers. He explains his view that all humans and vampires are inferior in his eyes and that he intends to wipe them from the Earth. Abigail finds evidence of the vampires' plans for human subjugation, a network of \"blood farms\" where [[brain dead]] humans are drained of their blood for vampire consumption. Blade [[Euthanasia|deactivates]] the farm's life support systems and executes the familiar who had been rounding up homeless humans for the vampires.\n\nReturning to the Nightstalkers' hideout, Abigail and Blade find all of them dead except for King and Sommerfield's daughter Zoe, both of whom have been taken captive. A recording left by Sommerfield, Daystar's creator, reveals that Drake's blood is all that is needed to make it complete and effective. King is tortured by the vampires for information, but refuses to talk, even when they threaten to turn him and force him to feed from Zoe's blood.\n\nBlade and Abigail arrive and free the captives. Drake eventually bests Blade in combat and prepares to kill him with his own sword. Abigail fires the Daystar arrow, but Drake catches it before it strikes him. He drops it to the floor by Blade, not realizing the danger it poses to him. Abigail shoots Drake with another arrow, this time wounding him. Blade uses the distraction to stab Drake with the Daystar arrow, triggering a chemical reaction that completes the \"Daystar\" virus, releasing it into the air. The virus becomes airborne, killing Danica and the rest of the vampires. As Drake slowly succumbs to his wounds and the virus, he praises Blade for fighting honorably, but warns him that he will eventually succumb to his need for blood, thus proving that Blade is the future of the vampire race.\n\nUsing the last of his power, Drake shapeshifts into Blade. The FBI recover the body, but as they begin the autopsy, it transforms back into the deceased Drake. King narrates that Drake's final transformation was a gift so that Blade could escape, leaving Blade free to continue fighting his never-ending war against the forces of evil.\n\n===Alternate endings===\nIn the unrated extended edition, the body in the morgue does not transform back into Drake. \"Blade\" awakens as the autopsy begins and attacks the doctors and FBI agents present. The scene ends as he menacingly approaches a cowering orderly. King narrates that the virus did not kill Blade as the human half of his heart did not stop beating, it only slowed down, causing him to enter into a comatose state until his body was ready to fight again.\n\nIn another alternate ending, the Nightstalkers reappear six months later, having tracked a werewolf to a casino in Asia.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as [[Blade (New Line franchise character)|Eric Brooks / Blade]]\n* [[Jessica Biel]] as Abigail Whistler\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as [[Hannibal King]]\n* [[Dominic Purcell]] as [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula / Drake]]\n* [[Kris Kristofferson]] as [[Abraham Whistler]]\n* [[Parker Posey]] as Danica Talos\n* [[Callum Keith Rennie]] as Asher Talos\n* [[Triple H|Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque]] as Jarko Grimwood\n* [[Natasha Lyonne]] as Sommerfield\n* Haili Page as Zoe\n* Mark Berry as Chief Martin Vreede\n* [[John Michael Higgins]] as Dr. Edgar Vance\n* [[Patton Oswalt]] as Hedges\n* [[James Remar]] as FBI Agent Ray Cumberland\n* Michael Anthony Rawlins as FBI Agent Wilson Hale\n* [[Christopher Heyerdahl]] as Caulder\n* Scott Heindl as Gedge\n* Cascy Beddow as \"Flick\"\n* Paul Anthony as Wolfe\n* John Ashker as Campbell\n* [[Eric Bogosian]] as Bentley Tittle\n* Ron Selmour as Dex\n* [[Fran\u00e7oise Yip]] as Virago\n* [[Kett Turton]] as \"Dingo\"\n* Michel Cook as SWAT Member\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn 2001, before the release of ''[[Blade II]]'', New Line made a deal with [[David S.
