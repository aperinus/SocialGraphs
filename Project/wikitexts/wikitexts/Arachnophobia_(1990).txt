Starring [[Jeff Daniels]] and [[John Goodman]], the film follows a small California town that becomes invaded by an aggressive and dangerous spider species. Its title refers to the [[Arachnophobia|fear of spiders]].\n\nThe film was the first produced by [[Hollywood Pictures]], a subsidiary of [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]]. It released in the [[United States]] on July 18, 1990, to generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $53.21 million on a $22 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be 400-700 words.

See \"Wikipedia:How to write a plot summary\" (WP:PLOTSUM) for general guidelines.-->\nIn a [[Venezuela]]n [[tepui]], [[Entomology|entomologist]] James Atherton captures two members of an aggressive, newly discovered species of spider of prehistoric origin. The spiders lack [[sex organ]]s, indicating that they are laborers or soldiers, thereby existing as a [[Eusociality|hive]] (atypical of spiders). A [[Fertility|fertile]] male of the same species bites bedridden American [[Nature photography|nature photographer]] Jerry Manley, who has a severe [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]] from the [[venom]] and dies. The scientist sends Manley's body back to his hometown of Canaima, California, unaware that the spider has crawled into the coffin.\n\nManley's desiccated body arrives at the mortuary of mortician Irv Kendall. The spider escapes from the coffin, is picked up by a [[crow]] and bites the bird. The crow falls dead outside the barn of Ross Jennings, a [[Family medicine|family physician]] who has moved from [[San Francisco]] to take over the practice of the retiring town doctor. Ross and his son both suffer from [[arachnophobia]].\n\nHe is short of patients after Sam Metcalf, the elderly town doctor, hesitates about retiring. The Venezuelan spider mates with a [[Tegenaria domestica|house spider]] in the Jennings's barn. The domestic spider produces hundreds of infertile, drone offspring with their father's lethal bite, and they leave the nest after [[Matriphagy|consuming her]].\n\nRoss's first patient, Margaret Hollins, dies after being bitten by one of the new spiders, and he doubts Metcalf's diagnosis of a heart attack. Another arachnid kills high school football player Todd Miller just after Ross conducted a routine team checkup, earning him the nickname of \"Dr. [[Death (personification)|Death]]\". The next victim is Metcalf himself, who is bitten and dies in front of his wife.\n\nWith Metcalf dead, Ross becomes Canaima's town doctor. Knowing that Metcalf was bitten by a spider and an iota of an unknown toxin was detected in his body, he suspects that the town maybe infested by deadly arachnids.\n\nRoss calls Atherton and asks him to help his investigation. The skeptical entomologist sends Chris Collins, his assistant. Ross and county [[coroner]] Milt Briggs order that Hollins and Miller be exhumed. They perform autopsies, and Chris confirms Ross's suspicion after he identifies bite marks. Ross and Chris catch one of the spiders in Metcalf's house the following day. When Chris mentions the new species discovered by Atherton, Ross realizes that the town's killer spiders and Atherton's discovery are related.\n\nAtherton joins Ross, Chris, Milt, Sheriff Lloyd Parsons, and [[Pest control|exterminator]] Delbert McClintock in Canaima, and they discover the spiders have a short lifespan due to their crossbreeding. Atherton tells them that the spiders are soldiers sent to eliminate potential threats for the male spider leading the colony, which he calls \"the general\". He learns that the general produced a queen and [[inbreeding|inbred]] with her to produce a second nest (guarded by the queen) which could produce fertile offspring, culminating in the species' next stage of [[evolution]] and [[Ant colony#Supercolonies|worldwide dispersal]].\n\nRoss, Chris, and Delbert discover that one nest is in Ross's barn. When he destroys the nest, Delbert finds Atherton dead{{snd}}attempting to catch the general, he touches a strand of the web and is bitten by the male spider which then escaped. Chris gets the Jennings family out of their infested house, but Ross falls through the floor into his wine cellar: the spiders' second nest, guarded by both the queen ''and'' the general.\n\nAfter he electrocutes the queen, Ross battles the general while he tries to burn the second [[Spider|egg sac]] (overcoming his fear of spiders by focusing on his need to stop them). Trapped by fallen debris as the general prepares to bite him, Ross stays perfectly still until the general is in position, then flings the spider into the fire. Despite being badly burnt, the general leaps out from the fire just as the egg sac hatches. Ross shoots the general with a [[nail gun]], sending the flaming spider into the egg sac and destroying the nest. Delbert rescues Ross: with the general, the queen and the nests destroyed and the soldiers dying, the spiders' threat is over. Deciding that they missed their old life, the Jennings family returns to San Francisco.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Dr. Ross Jennings\n* [[Harley Jane Kozak]] as Molly Jennings\n* [[John Goodman]] as Delbert McClintock\n* [[Julian Sands]] as Dr. James Atherton\n* [[Brian McNamara]] as Chris Collins\n* [[James Handy]] as Milt Briggs\n* [[Peter Jason]] as Henry Beechwood\n* [[Henry Jones (actor)|Henry Jones]] as Dr. Sam Metcalf\n* [[Frances Bay]] as Evelyn Metcalf\n* [[Mark L.

Spielberg and Marshall were the film's executive producers,<ref name=\"Maltin\">Leonard Maltin, ed., ''Leonard Maltin's 2002 Movie & Video Guide''. A Signet Book, 2001, p. 58.</ref> and [[Amblin Entertainment]] received a production credit.<ref name=\"Province\"/>\n\nMarshall intended that the film would be reminiscent of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'': \"People like to be scared but laughing, like a [[roller coaster]].

The film used over 300 [[Delena cancerides|Avondale spider]]s from [[New Zealand]], chosen for their large size, unusually social lifestyle, and harmlessness to humans; they were guided around the set by heat and cold. The large general and queen spiders were articulated models.\n\n''Arachnophobia'' was primarily filmed in [[Cambria, California]]; the introductory and jungle scenes were filmed in southern Venezuela. The school scenes were filmed at Coast Union High School, with students and staff used in the football scenes and group events; players in the locker room were CUHS student athletes.<ref>[http://mentalfloss.com/article/66197/18-creepy-facts-about-arachnophobia 18 Creepy Facts about Arachnophobia].
