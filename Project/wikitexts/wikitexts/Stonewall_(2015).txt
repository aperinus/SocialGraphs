Released on September 25, 2015, by [[Roadside Attractions]], the film is set in and around the 1969 [[Stonewall riots]], a violent clash with police that sparked the [[gay liberation]] movement in New York City. The film received generally negative reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nShortly before fleeing the conservative countryside in the late 1960s and moving to [[New York City]], Danny Winters, a gay teenage boy from [[Indiana]], is discovered by friends while making love with his boyfriend. His father is upset, and while his mother is ambivalent as she feels for her son, she does not stand up to her husband either. His father then refuses to sign the scholarship application for [[Columbia University]] where Danny is supposed to attend, but Danny departs for New York anyway, leaving behind his supportive younger sister Phoebe.\n\nAfter reaching [[Christopher Street]] in [[Greenwich Village]], he is befriended by a multiracial group of young, gay, and [[genderfluid]] street kids and [[drag queen]]s, and witnesses police violence against them. Danny goes into the [[Stonewall Inn]] accompanied by his friends and is asked for a dance by an older man, Trevor, who is a member of the [[Mattachine Society]]. Later that night, the police raid the bar and arrest some customers. Danny, who did not get arrested because he was not cross-dressing, picks up his friend Ray at the police station next day. Danny, destitute, then turns to prostitution and is seen disgraced while being [[Fellatio|fellated]] by a middle-aged man. Danny then goes to a meeting of the Mattachine Society, which purports to attain gay rights through conforming to society rather than radicalism. There he finds Trevor, and though their opinions differ, they end up spending the night together.\n\nDanny soon finds Trevor with another young man, and, heartbroken, he decides to leave the Village. Immediately after, he is abducted and forcibly sent out to a high-class prostitution business, at the direction of Ed Murphy, who runs the Stonewall Inn. Murphy has colluded with corrupt policemen and exploited homeless gay youth to his own advantage. Danny escapes, aided by Ray, and the two go to the bar to confront Murphy. The police then raid the bar and arrest some customers again. Danny is thrown onto the street as well as the rest of the customers, and, despite Trevor's dissuasion, hurls a brick into one of the bar's windows, screaming \"Gay power!\" This instigates the crowd to attack the police, who lock themselves up in the bar in response.\n\nOne year later, after finishing his first year at the university, Danny returns home and tells his sister that he is going to attend the [[Gay pride|gay liberation march]] on Christopher Street. The film ends on the day of the parade where he is marching in the street after reuniting with his friends and discovers his mother and sister on the sidewalk.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jeremy Irvine]] as Danny Winters\n* Jonny Beauchamp as Ray/Ramona\n* [[Joey King]] as Phoebe Winters\n* [[Caleb Landry Jones]] as Orphan Annie\n* [[Matt Craven]] as Seymour Pine\n* [[David Cubitt]] as Coach Winters\n* Vladimir Alexis as Queen Cong\n* Ben Sullivan as Quiet Paul\n* [[Alexandre Nachi]] as Little Lee\n* Andrea Frankle as Joyce Winters\n* Patrick Garrow as [[Bob Kohler]]\n* [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]] as Trevor\n* [[Ron Perlman]] as Ed Murphy\n* [[Atticus Mitchell]] as Matthew\n* [[Karl Glusman]] as Joe\n* Otoja Abit as [[Marsha P.
