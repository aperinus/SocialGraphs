She keeps her relationship a secret, but is also quick to start a fight without knowing it. However, when Django's mercenary friends itch for some female companionship, she softens and the two devise a plan to liberate the inmates of a local women's prison, where the inmates are kept barefoot and subjected to brutally hard labor. A woman named Terry ([[Anitra Ford]]), a social climber, ends up in the prison herself because of Blossom and Django's earlier robbery. She is now forced to deal with crazy inmates, gay guards, and torture of the cage. Terry, Blossom, and Django (who busted in by seducing Rocco, one of the guards) eventually come together to face off against the warden Zappa ([[Andr\u00e9s Centenera]]) to stage an explosive breakout.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Pam Grier]] as Blossom\n*[[Sid Haig]] as Django\n*[[Anitra Ford]] as Terry\n*Candice Roman as Carla\n*Teda Bracci as Bull Jones\n*[[Carol Speed]] as Mickie\n*Karen McKevic as Karen\n*[[Marissa Delgado]] as Rina\n*[[Vic Diaz]] as Rocco\n*Andres Centenera as Zappa\n*Zenaida Amador as Prison Doctor\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1972]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0068273}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|the_big_bird_cage}}\n\n{{Jack Hill}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Big Bird Cage, The}}\n[[Category:1972 films]]\n[[Category:1970s exploitation films]]\n[[Category:American prison films]]\n[[Category:Philippine drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Women in prison films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jack Hill]]\n[[Category:New World Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:American exploitation films]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]\n\n\n{{exploitation-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
