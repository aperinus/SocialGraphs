The film stars [[William H. Macy]], [[Maria Bello]], [[Shawn Hatosy]], [[Ron Livingston]], [[Estella Warren]], [[Paul Sorvino]], and [[Alec Baldwin]]. It follows a casino \"cooler\" whose mere presence at the [[gambling]] tables usually results in a streak of bad luck for the other players.\n\n''The Cooler'' had its world premiere at the [[2003 Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Film Festival]] on January 17, 2003, and was released in [[Limited theatrical release|limited theaters]] in the United States by [[Lionsgate Films|Lions Gate Films]] on November 26, 2003. Baldwin and Bello were nominated for [[Golden Globe Awards]] and [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]] for their supporting performances, with Baldwin receiving his first [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Las Vegas]], unlucky Bernie Lootz works at the Shangri-La [[casino]] as a \"cooler\" - a man with near professionally bad luck, his presence at a casino designed to stop people from winning. A cocktail waitress, Natalie, takes no real notice of Bernie, who is smitten with her. The casino manager and partner, Shelly, prides himself on running a \"classically\" Las Vegas casino, and resents the new establishments that attract a lower clientele. The owners, however, hire an advisor named Larry to help bring in more money with techniques contrary to Shelly's outdated policies. Bernie informs Shelly that he is leaving town in a week.\n\nAfter an encounter during which Bernie rescues Natalie from an aggressive customer, she appears to take an interest in him. Eager to prevent Bernie from leaving the casino, Shelly secretly prods Natalie into asking him out for a drink. They end up sleeping together, after which Natalie takes a genuine interest in Bernie. Although they begin seeing each other, Bernie is apprehensive due to his mostly bad luck. He reveals to Natalie that he used to be a [[gambling addiction|gambling addict]] and was in huge debt to several casinos; Shelly \"saved\" him by breaking his kneecap and paying off his debts in exchange for Bernie's work as a cooler for six years, which ends at the end of the week. By accident, the couple run into Bernie's estranged son Mikey and his pregnant wife Charlotte, who are scamming a diner by faking labor. Bernie tells Mikey to stop by the casino sometime.\n\nBernie is happy with his new relationship and his \"cooling\" abilities fade, much to Shelly's anger. Mikey and Charlotte come by the motel and Bernie gives them $3,000, but Natalie is skeptical of Charlotte's behavior. When Bernie reveals to Natalie he intends to leave Vegas, she initially says she won't go with him and Bernie is upset. When Bernie fails to cool Mikey at the [[craps]] table, Shelly realizes he is being cheated by Mikey. Shelly takes Mikey and Charlotte downstairs and his crew begins beating Mikey. Bernie then promises to pay the $150,000 Mikey was up, but Shelly breaks Mikey's hand and punches Charlotte, revealing her pregnancy was being faked anyway. Though distraught, that night Natalie and Bernie confess their love for one another, and Bernie again becomes a good luck charm.\n\nShelly calls Natalie to his office and reminds her that he hired her to date Bernie so he wouldn't leave Vegas, not to fall in love with him, which has made him both happy and lucky. He forces her to leave town abruptly, which hurts Bernie and ruins his luck. Natalie does truly love Bernie, though, and returns, thus restoring Bernie's luck. Shelly goes to Bernie's motel room and begins packing for Natalie and hits her, cutting her face. After a tense exchange wherein she claims Bernie is the closest thing Shelly has to a friend and he doesn't want him to leave, he simply leaves her there. When Bernie comes home, she reveals Shelly hired her to pretend to like him, but she truly fell in love with him.\n\nBanking on his good luck brought on by Natalie's devotion, Bernie confronts Shelly and calls him a coward with nothing in his life but the casino. Shelly lets him go on the condition he pay back the $150,000, which Bernie tries to win at craps. Larry wants Shelly to stop Bernie\u2019s hot streak, but Shelly takes him into the men\u2019s room and beats him, breaking his hand. Bernie leaves, and he and Natalie drive away from Vegas. He pulls over and reveals that he won a lot of money, but a cop presumably sent by Shelly approaches and readies to kill them. Shelly gets in his car and finds his partner waiting for him. On Larry's behalf, he whacks Shelly, saying they have to protect their interests. A drunk driver accidentally hits and kills the cop and Bernie remarks their luck must have turned. They drive off finally free.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[William H.

''[[Anatomy of a Scene]]''. [[Sundance TV|Sundance Channel]]. </ref> In order to show Bernie's evolution from loser to winner, [[costume design]]er Kristin M. Burke dressed him in suits and clothes that progressively became better fits. Early in the film, the character resembles a boy dressed in his father's oversized clothing. By the end, Bernie is not only wearing the right size suit, but he has accessorized it with a brightly colored shirt and tie that represent his sunnier disposition. Lighting schemes designed by cinematographer Jim Whitaker also contributed to documenting Bernie's progression. In early scenes, his face is kept in the shadows, but later he is filmed in a spotlight and backlit to make him stand out from everything behind him.\n\nThe song \"[[Almost Like Being in Love]]\", which is used to mark Bernie's transition from mournful sad sack to winner, was written by [[Frederick Loewe]] and [[Alan Jay Lerner]] for the [[musical theatre|stage musical]] ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]''.\n\n== Release ==\nThe [[film premiere]] was at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web |last= |date=January 20, 2003 |title=Dealmaking and Partygoing at Sundance 2003 |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2003/01/dealmaking-and-partygoing-at-sundance-2003-80008/ |access-date=2022-09-25 |website=[[IndieWire]] |language=en}}</ref> ''The Cooler'' was shown at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], the [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]], the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], and the [[Deauville Film Festival]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Cooler (2003) Awards & Festivals |url=https://mubi.com/films/the-cooler |access-date=2022-09-25 |website=[[Mubi (streaming service)|Mubi]]}}</ref> among others, before going into limited release in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Cooler - Domestic Box Office |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl827164161/?ref_=bo_tt_gr_1 |access-date=2022-09-25 |website=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> The film expanded nationwide on December 19, 2003.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mitchell |first=Wendy |date=December 19, 2003 |title=William H.

Mr. Kramer, rather than trying to discover anything new, is content to recycle familiar characters and story lines.

Top of the line is Baldwin, whose revelatory portrayal of an old Vegas hard-liner in thrall to the town's faded allure is the stuff Oscars are made of.
