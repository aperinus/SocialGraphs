The film presents a thinly-fictionalized account of the events surrounding the assassination of the democratic [[Greece|Greek]] politician [[Grigoris Lambrakis]] in 1963. With its dark view of [[Greek politics]] and its downbeat ending, the film captures the director's outrage about the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|junta that then ruled Greece]].\n\nThe film stars [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] as the investigating magistrate, an [[analogue (literature)|analogue]] of [[Christos Sartzetakis]], who would be the [[Greek president]] from 1985 to 1990. International stars [[Yves Montand]] and [[Irene Papas]] also appear but, despite their star billing have very little screen time. [[Jacques Perrin]], who coproduced the film, plays a key role as a photojournalist.\n\nThe film's title refers to a popular Greek protest slogan ({{lang-el|\u0396\u03b5\u03b9}}, {{IPA-el|\u02c8zi|IPA}}) meaning \"he lives,\" in reference to Lambrakis.\n\nIt was the first film and one of only a handful to be nominated by the [[Academy Awards]] for both [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]]. It won the latter as well as the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Music]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Film]]. At the [[27th Golden Globe Awards]], its producers refused the award to protest the film's exclusion from the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]] category.<ref name=GlobeRefusal>{{cite web|url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/trivia-0|title=Trivia|work=Golden Globes website|access-date=2 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story begins with the closing moments of a rather dull government lecture and slideshow on agricultural policy until the leader of the security police of a [[right-wing]] military-dominated government takes over the podium for an impassioned speech describing the government's program to combat [[leftism]] [[Glossary of the Greek military junta|by using the metaphors]] \"a [[mildew]] of the mind\", an [[infiltration tactic|infiltration]] of \"[[-ism|isms]]\" and \"sunspots\".\n\nThe scene shifts to preparations for a [[political rally|rally]] of the opposition faction in which the [[pacifist]] deputy is to give a speech advocating [[nuclear disarmament]]. There have been attempts by the government to prevent the speech from being delivered. The venue has been changed to a much smaller hall, logistical problems have appeared out of nowhere and the people handing out leaflets about the change of venue are attacked by thugs under the command of the police. On his way to the venue, the deputy is hit on the head by one of the right-wing [[anticommunist]] protestors, some of whom are sponsored by the government, but carries on with his sharp speech. As the deputy crosses the street from the hall after giving his speech, a delivery truck speeds past him, and a man on the open truck bed strikes him down with a club. The injury eventually proves fatal, and the police manipulate witnesses to force the conclusion that the deputy was simply run over by a [[drunk driving|drunk driver]].\n\nHowever, the police do not control the hospital, where the [[autopsy]] disproves their interpretation. The [[inquisitorial system|examining magistrate]], with the assistance of a photojournalist (Perrin), now uncovers sufficient evidence to indict not only the two right-wing militants who committed the murder but also four high-ranking military police officers. The action of the film concludes with one of the deputy's associates rushing to see his widow to give her the surprising news of the officers' indictments. The widow looks distressed and appears not to believe things will change for the better.\n\nAn [[epilogue]] provides a synopsis of the subsequent turns of events. Instead of justice being served, the prosecutor is mysteriously removed from the case, several key witnesses die under suspicious circumstances, the assassins receive relatively short sentences, the officers receive only administrative reprimands, the deputy's close associates die or are deported and the photojournalist is sent to prison for disclosing official documents. The heads of the government resign after public disapproval, but before elections are carried out, a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] occurs, and the military seize power. They ban [[modern art]], [[popular music]], [[avant-garde]] novelists, [[modern elementary mathematics|modern mathematics]], [[Ancient philosophy|classic]] and [[Modern philosophy|modern philosophers]] and the use of the term \"[[Zeta|\u0396]]\" ({{lang-el|z\u00edta}}, or {{lang-el|zi}}, which is used by protesters against the former government), which refers to the deputy and means: \"He lives.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] as The Examining Magistrate (based on [[Christos Sartzetakis]])\n* [[Yves Montand]] as The Deputy ([[Grigoris Lambrakis]])\n* [[Irene Papas]] as Helene, the Deputy's wife\n* [[Pierre Dux]] as The General (the main antagonist, based on [[Konstantinos Mitsou]])\n* [[Jacques Perrin]] as Photojournalist (Giorgos Bertsos)\n* [[Charles Denner]] as Manuel\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier]] as Public prosecutor\n* [[Georges G\u00e9ret]] as Nick\n* [[Bernard Fresson]] as Matt\n* [[Marcel Bozzuffi]] as Vago (Emmanouel Emmannouilidis \u2013 man who struck Lambrakis)\n* [[Julien Guiomar]] as The Colonel (based on Efthimios Kamoutsis)\n* [[Magali No\u00ebl]] as Nick's sister\n* [[Renato Salvatori]] as Yago (Spyro Gotzamanis \u2013 the driver)\n* Clotilde Joanno as Shoula\n* [[Maurice Baquet]] as The Mason (Manolis Hatziapostolou)\n* [[G\u00e9rard Darrieu]] as Barone\n* [[Jean Bouise]] as Georges Pirou\n* [[Jean-Pierre Miquel]] as Pierre\n* Van Doude as The Hospital Director\n* [[Jean Dast\u00e9]] as Ilya Coste\n* Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gobbi as Jimmy, the boxer\n* Guy Mairesse as Dumas\n* [[Andr\u00e9e Tainsy]] as Nick's mother\n* Eva Simonet as Niki\n* [[Hassan El-Hassani]] as a military officer\n* Sid Ahmed Agoumi as The General's driver\n* [[Raoul Coutard]] (''uncredited'') as the English Surgeon\n* [[Fran\u00e7oise Bonnot]] (''uncredited'') as the final voiceover\n* [[Said Kabouya]] (''uncredited'') as the valet\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Theatre Champs Elysees 35.jpg|thumb|267px|Ballet scenes were shot at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] in Paris]]\n\nThe 1963 murder of Greek politician and physician [[Grigoris Lambrakis]] and subsequent [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|military junta]] served as the basis for the story.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shaw |first=Tony |date=2014 |title=Cinematic Terror: A Global History of Terrorism on Film |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA |page=105 |isbn=978-1441158093}}</ref> Among Costa-Gavras' references to the actual events was the frequency with which the military compared ideologies to diseases, seen when the General compares [[-isms]] to [[mildew]].<ref name=\"Costa\">{{cite AV media |last=Costa-Gavras |author-link=Costa-Gavras |date=2002 |title=Z Commentary Track |medium=DVD |publisher=Wellspring Media}}</ref> The Magistrate was based on real-life Greek jurist [[Christos Sartzetakis]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Oliver Boyd Barrett |author2=David Herrera |author3=James A.

The Greek junta had placed the composer under house arrest but he was able to give his approval to Costa-Gavras for the use of existing musical pieces.\n\nThe film features, but does not credit, [[Pierre Henry]]'s contemporary hit song, \"[[Psych\u00e9 Rock]]\". The soundtrack as released on [[LP album|LP]] and [[CD]] replaces Henry's song with a similar track written by Theodorakis named \"Caf\u00e9 Rock.\"\n\n# Main Title (Antonis) from the \"[[Mauthausen Trilogy]]\" of Mikis Theodorakis\n# The Smiling Youth \n# The Chase-The Smiling Youth\n# Murmur of the Heart\n# Cafe Rock\n# Arrival of Helen-The Smiling Youth\n# Batucada\n# The Smiling Youth (Bouzouki Version)\n# The Smiling Youth\n# Who's Not Talking About Easter\n# Finale-The Smiling Youth\n# Murmur of the Heart\n# In This Town\n\n\"The Happy Youth\" and \"Who's Not Talking About Easter\" were among the poems adapted from [[Brendan Behan]]'s play ''[[The Hostage (play)|The Hostage]]'' by Theodorakis in 1962.

It is about how even moral victories are corrupted. It will make you weep and will make you angry. It will tear your guts out...When the Army junta staged its coup in 1967, the right-wing generals and the police chief were cleared of all charges and 'rehabilitated.' Those responsible for unmasking the assassination now became political criminals. These would seem to be completely political events, but the young director Costa-Gavras has told them in a style that is almost unbearably exciting. ''Z'' is at the same time a political cry of rage and a brilliant suspense thriller. It even ends in a chase: Not through the streets but through a maze of facts, alibis and official corruption.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/z-1969 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |newspaper=The Chicago Sun-Times |title=Z |date=December 30, 1969 |access-date=2011-02-02}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, [[James Berardinelli]] wrote, \"''Z'' was the third feature film from Greek-born Costa-Gavras, but it is the movie that captured him to the world's attention, winning a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.
