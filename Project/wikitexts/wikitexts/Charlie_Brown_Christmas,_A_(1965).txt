It is the first TV special based on the [[comic strip]] ''[[Peanuts]]'', by [[Charles M. Schulz]]. Produced by [[Lee Mendelson]] and directed by [[Bill Melendez]], the program made its debut on [[CBS]] on December 9, 1965. In the special, [[Charlie Brown]] finds himself depressed despite the onset of the cheerful holiday season. [[Lucy van Pelt|Lucy]] suggests he direct a neighborhood Christmas play, but his best efforts are ignored and mocked by his peers when he chooses a real, but puny, [[Christmas tree]] as a centerpiece.\n\nAfter the comic strip's debut in 1950, ''Peanuts'' had become a phenomenon worldwide by the mid-1960s.  The special was commissioned and sponsored by [[The Coca-Cola Company]], and was written over a period of several weeks, and produced on a small budget in six months. In casting the characters, the producers took an unconventional route, hiring child actors. The program's soundtrack was similarly unorthodox, featuring a [[jazz]] score by pianist [[Vince Guaraldi]]. Its lack of a [[laugh track]] (a staple in US television animation in this period), in addition to its tone, pacing, music, and animation, led both the producers and the network to predict the project would be a disaster.  However, contrary to their collective apprehension, ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'' received high ratings and acclaim from critics. It has been honored with an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and a [[Peabody Award]], and has become an annual presentation in the United States, airing on [[broadcast television]] during the [[Christmas season]]. Its success paved the way for a series of [[Peanuts filmography|Peanuts television specials and films]]. Its [[A Charlie Brown Christmas (soundtrack)|jazz soundtrack]] achieved commercial success, selling five million copies in the US.<ref name=\"RIAA\">{{Cite web |title=Gold & Platinum |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=vince+guaraldi+trio&ti=charlie+brown+christmas&adv=SEARCH#search_section |access-date=May 12, 2022 |website=RIAA}}</ref> Live theatrical versions of ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'' have been staged.\n\n==Plot==\nOn their way to join their friends ice skating on a frozen pond, [[Charlie Brown]] confides in [[Linus van Pelt|Linus]] that, despite all the things he likes about the Christmas season, he is still depressed. After Linus' reproach, and a put-down from [[Violet Gray|Violet]], he visits [[Lucy van Pelt|Lucy]]'s psychiatric booth and tells her his problem. She suggests that he direct the group's annual [[Nativity play|Christmas play]] to get him involved, and he accepts.\n\nCharlie Brown becomes even more discouraged by his observations of Christmas' commercialization as he heads for the rehearsal: Lucy laments over not receiving [[real estate]] for Christmas; [[Snoopy]] decorates his doghouse for a neighborhood lights and display contest; and Charlie Brown's younger sister [[Sally Brown|Sally]] asks him to write a greedy letter to [[Santa Claus]]. At the rehearsal, Charlie Brown finds a play fit for the 1960s with dancing, lively music, an uncooperative cast and a \"Christmas Queen\" (Lucy). Unable to control the cast, Charlie Brown decides the play needs a more \"proper mood,\" and recommends a [[Christmas tree]]; Lucy suggests a big, pink [[aluminum Christmas tree|aluminum tree]] then sends him and Linus to get one.\n\nAt the tree lot, Charlie Brown picks the only real tree there, a small sapling. Linus questions his choice, but Charlie Brown believes that once decorated, it will be perfect. When they return, however, Lucy and the others scorn him and the tree and walk away laughing. Crestfallen, Charlie Brown loudly asks if anyone knows what Christmas is all about; Linus says he does, walks to center stage, asks for a spotlight, recites the [[annunciation to the shepherds]], returns and says, \"That's what Christmas is all about, Charlie Brown.\"\n\nRealizing that he does not have to let [[commercialism]] ruin his own Christmas, Charlie Brown takes the tree home to decorate it and show the others that it will work in the play. He stops at Snoopy's doghouse, which had won the lights and display contest, and hangs a large red Christmas ball on his tree. The ornament's weight causes the tiny tree to bend to the ground. Believing he has killed the tree, Charlie Brown, dejected, walks away.\n \nThe others realize that they were too hard on Charlie Brown and quietly follow him. As they all start to see its potential, Linus gently uprights the drooping tree and wraps his blanket around its base to give it some support. After the others give the tree a makeover using more decorations from the doghouse, even Lucy concedes to Charlie Brown's choice. The kids then start humming \"[[Hark! The Herald Angels Sing]]\". Hearing them, Charlie Brown returns to see that the sapling is now a magnificent Christmas tree. All the kids shout, \"Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown!\", and then sing \"Hark\" with Charlie Brown joining in as snow begins to fall.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[Peter Robbins (actor)|Peter Robbins]] as [[Charlie Brown]]{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=21}}\n* Christopher Shea: [[Linus van Pelt]]{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=22}}\n* Tracy Stratford as [[Lucy van Pelt|Lucille \"Lucy\" van Pelt]]{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=23}}\n* Cathy Steinberg as [[Sally Brown]]{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=23}}\n* Chris Doran as [[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]] and [[Shermy]]\n* Geoffrey Orstein as [[Pig-Pen]]\n* [[Sally Dryer]] as [[Violet (Peanuts)|Violet]]\n* Anne Altieri as [[Frieda (Peanuts)|Frieda]]\n* Bill Melendez as [[Snoopy]]\n* Karen Mendelson as [[Patty (Peanuts)|Patty]]\n* Choral vocals: Members of the children's choir of St. Paul's Episcopal Church (San Rafael, California) directed by Robert \u201cBarry\u201d Mineah.

Schulz's comic strip ''Peanuts'' had gained enormous popularity.<ref name=\"makingof\">{{cite video| people = [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Lee Mendelson]] |display-authors=etal | title =The Making of ''A Charlie Brown Christmas''| medium = DVD| publisher =Paramount Home Entertainment |date=2004}}</ref> Television producer [[Lee Mendelson]] acknowledged the strip's cultural impression and had an idea for a documentary on its success, phoning Schulz to propose the idea. Schulz, an avid baseball fan, recognized Mendelson from his documentary on ballplayer [[Willie Mays]], ''A Man Named Mays'', and invited him to his home in [[Sebastopol, California]], to discuss the project.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=11}} Their meeting was cordial, with the plan to produce a half-hour documentary set. Mendelson wanted to feature roughly \"one or two\" minutes of animation, and Schulz suggested animator Bill Melendez, with whom he collaborated some years before on a spot for the Ford Motor Company.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=12}} Mendelson later stated that he was drawn to doing an animated Charlie Brown after working on ''A Man Named Mays'', noting that Mays was arguably the best baseball player of all time, while Charlie Brown, in a [[running gag]] in the strips, was one of the worst, making him a natural follow-up subject to his previous work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/1997/novdec/articles/mendelson.html |title=Life After Snoopy |first=Marc |last=Greilsamer |work=Stanford Alumni Magazine |date=November 1997 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208045202/http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/1997/novdec/articles/mendelson.html |archive-date=December 8, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDespite the popularity of the strip and acclaim from advertisers, networks were not interested in the special.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=14}} By April 1965, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' featured the ''Peanuts'' gang on its magazine cover, perhaps prompting a call from John Allen of the New York-based McCann Erickson Agency.<ref name=\"makingof\" /> Mendelson imagined he would sell his documentary, and blindly agreed to Allen's proposal: an animated half-hour ''Peanuts'' Christmas special.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=14}} The Coca-Cola Company was looking for a special to sponsor during the holiday season. \"The bad news is that today is Wednesday and they'll need an outline in Atlanta by Monday,\" Allen remarked to Mendelson.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=15}} He quickly contacted Schulz, and the duo got to work with plans for a ''Peanuts'' Christmas special.<ref name=\"makingof\" /> The duo prepared an outline for the Coca-Cola executives in less than one day, and Mendelson would later recall that the bulk of ideas came from Schulz, whose \"ideas flowed nonstop.\"{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=17}} According to Mendelson, their pitch to Coca-Cola consisted of \"winter scenes, a school play, a scene to be read from the Bible, and a sound track combining jazz and traditional music.\"{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=19}} The outline did not change over the course of its production.<ref name=\"enq\" />\n\nAs Allen was in Europe, the duo received no feedback on their pitch for several days.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=17}} When Allen got in touch with them, he informed them that Coca-Cola wanted to buy the special, but also wanted it for an early December broadcast, giving the duo just six months to scramble together a team to produce the special. Mendelson assured him \u2013 without complete confidence in his statements \u2013 that this would be no problem. Following this, ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'' entered production.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=17}}\n\n=== Writing ===\n[[File:Charles Schulz NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|Charles M. Schulz in 1956. His goal for the special was to focus on the [[true meaning of Christmas]].]]\nSchulz's main goal for a ''Peanuts''-based Christmas special was to focus on the [[true meaning of Christmas]].{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=17}} He desired to juxtapose this theme with interspersed shots of snow and ice-skating, perhaps inspired by his own childhood growing up in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], Minnesota.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=17}} He also created the idea for the school play, and mixing jazz with traditional Christmas carols.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=17}} Schulz was adamant about Linus' reading of the Bible, despite Mendelson and Melendez's concerns that religion was a controversial topic, especially on television.<ref name=\"enq\" /> Melendez recalled Schulz turned to him and remarked, \"If we don't do it, who will?\".<ref name=\"makingof\" /> Schulz's estimation proved accurate, and in the 1960s, fewer than 9 percent of television Christmas episodes contained a substantive reference to religion, according to university researcher Stephen Lind.<ref>Lind, Stephen J. \"Christmas in the 1960s: A Charlie Brown Christmas, Religion, and the Conventions of the Genre\" Journal of Religion and Popular Culture 26.1 (2014)</ref>\n\nSchulz's faith in the Bible stemmed from his Midwest background and religious and historical studies;<ref name=\"enq\" /> as such, aspects of religion would be a topic of study throughout his life.<ref>Templeton, David.

Schulz\" (Jackson: U P Mississippi, 2015)</ref>\n\nThe program's script has been described as \"barebones\", and was completed in only a few weeks.<ref name=\"USA\" /> In the days following the special's sell to Coca-Cola, Mendelson and animator Bill Melendez met with Schulz in his home to expand upon the ideas promised in the pitch. Mendelson remembered that on the previous Christmas Day he and his spouse had read Hans Christian Andersen's \"[[The Fir-Tree]]\" to their children.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=19}} Schulz countered with the idea that there be a tree with the spirit of lead character Charlie Brown.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=20}} Mendelson suggested they employ a [[laugh track]], a staple of television animation, but Schulz rejected this idea immediately.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=20}} He felt strongly that the audience should not be instructed when to laugh.<ref name=\"USA\" /> They spoke at length about creating an official theme that was neither jazz nor traditional to open the program. Schulz wanted a part of the special to feature the character of Schroeder performing Beethoven, and Mendelson combined this with the inclusion of Vince Guaraldi's \"[[Linus and Lucy]]\" number.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=20}} Schulz penned the script for ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'', with Melendez plotting out the animation via a storyboard. His storyboard contained six panels for each shot, spanning a combined eighty or-so pages.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=20}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nIn casting the silent comic strip characters of ''Peanuts'', the trio pulled from their personalities.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=21}} Lead character Charlie Brown's voice was decided to be downbeat and nondescript (\"blah,\" as Mendelson observed), while Lucy be bold and forthright.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=21}} Linus' voice, it was decided, would combine both sophistication with childlike innocence.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=21}} Mendelson recognized that the character of Snoopy was the strip's most popular character who seemed to seize \"the best jokes,\" but realized they could not cast a voice for the cartoon dog. \"In the process, we gained a veritable 'canine [[Harpo Marx]],'\" Mendelson later wrote.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=21}} Melendez suggested he provide gibberish for Snoopy's mutterings, and simply speed up the tape to prevent viewers from knowing.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=21}} There are no adult characters in the strip or in this special. Later specials would introduce an offscreen teacher; her lines are eschewed for the sound of a [[Mute (music)|muted trombone]] (suggested by Guaraldi) as the team behind the specials found it humorous.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=24}}\n\nWith this in mind, the trio set out to cast the characters, which proved to be a daunting process. Casting for Charlie Brown proved most difficult, as it required both good acting skills but also the ability to appear nonchalant.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=20}} The producers picked eight-year-old [[Peter Robbins (actor)|Peter Robbins]], already known for his roles spanning television, film, and advertisements.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=21}} Robbins considered Charlie Brown to be one of his favorite characters, and despite leaving acting as an adult, he considered his time in the role a highlight of his life.<ref name=robbinsdeath>{{cite news|url=https://fox5sandiego.com/entertainment/charlie-brown-voice-actor-dies-at-65/|title=\u2018Charlie Brown\u2019 voice actor dies at 65|first=Phil|last=Blauer|publisher=Fox 5 San Diego|date=January 25, 2022|accessdate=January 25, 2022}}</ref> His godmother, Hollywood agent Hazel McMillen, discovered Christopher Shea, who would become Linus in the special.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=21}} His slight lisp, according to Mendelson, gave him a \"youthful sweetness,\" while his emotional script reading \"gave him power and authority as well.\"{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=22}} Tracy Stratford played the role of Lucy, with the creators being impressed by her attitude and professionalism.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=23}} Kathy Steinberg was the youngest of the performers, just six years old at the time of recording. Too young to read, the producers had to give her one line at a time to recite.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=23}} Robbins remembered Melendez did this for him as well, joking that he also mistakenly copied his Latino accent.<ref name=\"makingof\" /> Mendelson desired to have non-actors (not \"Hollywood kids\") perform on the special, and he sent tape recorders home with his employees for their children to audition.<ref name=\"USA\" />\n\nMuch of the background cast came from Mendelson's home neighborhood in northern California.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=23}} According to Robbins, the children viewed the script's sophisticated dialogue as \"edgy,\" finding several words and phrases, among them \"eastern syndicate\", difficult to pronounce.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=21}} He recalled the recording sessions as chaotic, with excited children running rampant. Nevertheless, the recording of ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'' was completed in one day.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=21}} [[Jefferson Airplane]] was recording next door and came over to obtain the children's autographs.<ref name=\"makingof\" /> Following the special's broadcast, the children became wildly popular in their respective elementary schools; Robbins recalled groups approaching him asking him to recite lines of dialogue.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=23}}\n\n=== Animation ===\nAnimation for ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'' was created by Bill Melendez Productions. Mendelson had no idea whether or not completing a half-hour's worth of animation would be possible given the production's six-month schedule, but Melendez confirmed its feasibility.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=19}} In actuality, animation was only completed in the final four months of production.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=59}} CBS initially wanted an hour's worth of animation, but Melendez talked them down to a half-hour special, believing an hour of television animation was too much.{{sfn|Solomon|2013|p=11}} Having never worked on a half-hour special before, Melendez phoned [[William Hanna|Bill Hanna]] of [[Hanna-Barbera]] for advice, but Hanna declined to give any. CBS gave a budget of $76,000 to produce the show and it went $20,000 over budget.{{sfn|Solomon|2013|p=11}} The first step in creating the animation was to make a pencil drawing, afterwards inking and painting the drawing onto a [[cel]].<ref name=\"makingof\" /> The cel was then placed onto a painted background. There are 13,000 drawings in the special, with 12 frames per second to create the illusion of movement.<ref name=\"makingof\" />\n\nMelendez had previously worked for [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros.]] and [[Walt Disney Productions|Disney]], and working on ''Peanuts''-related material gave him a chance to animate a truly flat cartoon design.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=57}} The movement of Schulz's characters, particularly the ''Peanuts'' gang, was [[Limited animation|limited]]. The character of Snoopy, however, proved the exception to the rule. \"He can do anything \u2013 move and dance \u2013 and he's very easy to animate,\" said Melendez.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=57}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|A Charlie Brown Christmas (soundtrack)}}\nThe soundtrack to ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'' is an unorthodox mix of traditional Christmas music and jazz. The jazz portions were created by the [[Vince Guaraldi Trio]]. Producer Lee Mendelson, a fan of jazz, heard Guaraldi's [[crossover hit]] \"[[Cast Your Fate to the Wind]]\" on the radio not long after completion of his documentary ''Charlie Brown & Charles Schulz'', and contacted the musician to produce music for the special.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=12}} Guaraldi composed the music for the project, creating an entire piece, \"Linus and Lucy,\" to serve as the theme.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=14}} When Coca-Cola commissioned ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'' in spring 1965, Guaraldi returned to write the music.<ref name=\"makingof\" /> The first instrumentals for the special were recorded by Guaraldi at [[Glendale, California]]'s Whitney Studio with bassist [[Monty Budwig]] and drummer [[Colin Bailey (drummer)|Colin Bailey]].{{sfn|Bang|2012|p=176}} Recycling \"Linus and Lucy\" from the earlier special, Guaraldi completed two new originals for the special, \"Skating\", and \"Christmas Time Is Here\".{{sfn|Bang|2012|p=176}} In the weeks preceding the premiere, Mendelson encountered trouble finding a lyricist for Guaraldi's instrumental intro, and penned \"Christmas Time is Here\" in \"about 15 minutes\" on the backside of an envelope.<ref name=\"enq\" />\n\nThe special opens and closes with a choir of children, culled from St. Paul's Episcopal Church in [[San Rafael, California]], performing \"Christmas Time Is Here\" and \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\".{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=23}} One of the singers, Candace Hackett Shively, went on to become an elementary school teacher, and sent a letter of gratitude to Schulz after he announced his retirement in 2000.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=23}} In the letter, she recalls recording the choir at <!-- WP article is about the facility which opened in 1971. -->Fantasy Studios and going out for ice cream afterwards, while also saying she tells the story to her grade-schoolers each holiday season.{{sfn|Mendelson|2013|p=24}} The recording sessions were conducted in late autumn 1965 and were cut in three separate sessions over two weeks. They often ran late into the night, resulting in angry parents, some who forbade their children from returning; consequently, numerous new children were present at each session.{{sfn|Bang|2012|p=187}} The children were directed by Barry Mineah, who demanded perfection from the choir. Mendelson and Guaraldi disagreed, desiring the \"kids to sound like kids\"; they used a slightly off-key version of \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\" in the final cut.{{sfn|Bang|2012|p=187}} Children were paid five dollars for their participation. In addition, the children recorded dialogue for the special's final scene, in which the crowd of kids shout \"Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown!\"{{sfn|Bang|2012|p=187}}\n\nThe soundtrack for the special was recorded during these sessions, with decisions regarding timing and phrasing determined quickly. Guaraldi brought in bassist Fred Marshall and drummer [[Jerry Granelli]] to record the music, and spent time later re-recording earlier tracks, including covers of \"The Christmas Song\" and \"Greensleeves.\" The eventual LP release credited Guaraldi solely, neglecting to mention the other musicians; Guaraldi was notorious for never keeping records of his session players.{{sfn|Bang|2012|p=188}} Nearly three decades later, in an effort to resolve the matter, [[Fantasy Records|Fantasy]] surmised that the recordings with Budwig and Bailey were employed in the special, while Marshall and Granelli recorded the album.{{sfn|Bang|2012|p=188}} Despite this, other individuals have come forward claiming to have recorded the special's music: bassists Eugene Firth and Al Obidinski, and drummers Paul Distel and Benny Barth. Firth and Distil are listed as performers on a studio-session report Guaraldi filed for the American Federation of Musicians.{{sfn|Bang|2012|p=188}}\n\n''A Charlie Brown Christmas'' was voted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award|Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 2007,<ref name=\"ChartWatch\">{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart-watch/week-ending-jan-1-2012-albums-she-back-153256993.html|title=Week Ending Jan. 1, 2012.

Although Vince had never scored anything else and although I was basically a documentary film maker at the time, we started to work together on the cues because we both loved jazz and we both played the piano.
