The film follows the [[Experimental physics|experimental physicists]] at the European Organization for Nuclear Research ([[CERN]]) who run the experiments, as well as the [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicists]] who attempt to provide a conceptual framework for the LHC's results. The film begins in 2008 with the first firing of the LHC and concludes in 2012 with the successful identification of the [[Higgs boson]].<ref name=\"SFGate\">{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Particle-Fever-an-intimate-look-at-a-weighty-5295703.php | title='Particle Fever' an intimate look at a weighty experiment | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=9 March 2014 | access-date=11 October 2016 | author=Perlman, David}}</ref>\n\nThe Communication Awards of the [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]] awarded a $20,000 prize for excellence in communicating science to the general public in Film/Radio/TV to David Kaplan and Mark Levinson for \"Particle Fever\" on October 14, 2015. The awards are given to individuals in four categories: books, film/radio/TV, magazine/newspaper and online, and are supported by the W. M. Keck Foundation.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://livestream.com/accounts/7036396/events/4407035 | title=2015 Communication Awards Ceremony | work=Livestream.com | access-date=11 October 2016 | author=NAS-Webcast}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film is composed of two narrative threads. One follows the large team of experimental physicists at CERN as they try to get the LHC running properly. After a promising initial test run, the LHC suffers a liquid helium leak in 2007 that damages its [[electromagnets]]. [[Fabiola Gianotti]], Martin Aleksa, and Monica Dunford are all shown discussing how to handle the negative publicity surrounding the accident, and how to proceed. After repairs in 2009, the LHC begins to run experiments again at half power.\n\nThe other thread follows the competing theories of [[Nima Arkani-Hamed]] and his mentor [[Savas Dimopoulos]]. In the film, Arkani-Hamed advocates for the \"[[multiverse]]\" theory, which predicts the mass of the Higgs boson to be approximately 140 [[Electronvolt|giga-electronvolts]]. Dimopoulos argues for the more-established [[supersymmetry]] theory, which predicts the mass of the Higgs boson to be approximately 115 GeV.\n\nThe narrative threads combine at the end of the film, when CERN announces the confirmed existence of a Higgs-like particle, with a mass of approximately 125 GeV. The discovery of the particle is met with a standing ovation, and [[Peter Higgs]] is shown wiping away tears. However, neither of the competing theories of the universe is definitively supported by the finding.\n\nLater, Kaplan is shown admitting that ''none'' of his theoretical models are supported by this finding, and that the long-term implications of the discovery are unclear.<ref name=\"Murch\" /><ref name=\"Woit\">{{cite web | url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=6308 | title=Particle Fever | work=Not Even Wrong | date=1 October 2013 | access-date=11 October 2016 |last1 =Woit| first1 = Peter| author-link1 =Peter Woit}}</ref><ref name=\"Scott\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/movies/particle-fever-tells-of-search-for-the-higgs-boson.html | title='Particle Fever' Tells of Search for the Higgs Boson | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=4 March 2014 | access-date=13 October 2016 | author=Scott, A.
