Loosely based on [[Dr. Seuss]]'s [[The Cat in the Hat|1957 book of the same name]], it was the second and final live-action feature-length Dr. Seuss adaptation after ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000 film)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' (2000). The film stars [[Mike Myers]] in the title role with [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Kelly Preston]], [[Dakota Fanning]], [[Spencer Breslin]], [[Amy Hill]] and [[Sean Hayes]] in supporting roles.\n\nProduction on the film began in 1997 with [[Tim Allen]] originally cast in the title role. After Allen dropped out due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[The Santa Clause 2]]'', the role went to Myers. Filming took place in [[California]] and lasted three months from late 2002 to early 2003. As with the previous Dr. Seuss adaptation, many new characters and [[subplot]]s were added to the story to bring it up to feature-length.\n\nThe film was released in theaters on November 21, 2003 in the United States by [[Universal Pictures]] and internationally by [[DreamWorks Pictures]], and was a [[box-office bomb|financial failure]], only grossing $133.9 million against a budget of $109 million<ref name=\"BOM\" /> and was panned by critics.<ref name=\"Ivie\">{{cite web|first=Devon|last=Ivie |title=Mike Myers Was a Huge 'Diva' While Filming The Cat in the Hat|url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/10/mike-myers-was-a-diva-in-the-cat-in-the-hat.html|website=Vulture|date=October 26, 2016|quote=\"It was so widely panned that Dr. Seuss's widow banned any other live-action adaptations.\"}}</ref> Seuss's widow, Audrey Geisel, was also critical of the film and decided to disallow any further live-action adaptations of her husband's works, resulting in the cancellation of a sequel based on ''[[The Cat in the Hat Comes Back]]''; all Dr. Seuss film adaptations have since been produced using [[computer animation]].<ref name=\"today.com\" /><ref name=\"Ivie\" />\n\nIn March 2012, an animated remake was announced by Universal and [[Illumination (company)|Illumination]] but never came to fruition.

One day, Joan leaves her children at home with lethargic babysitter Mrs. Kwan while she goes to the office, forbidding them to enter the living room which is being kept pristine for an office party she is hosting that night.\n\nAfter Mrs. Kwan falls asleep, Sally and Conrad meet The Cat in the Hat, an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] talking [[cat]] with a red-and-white striped [[top hat]] and a large red [[bow tie]] who wants to teach them how to have fun but the family's pet fish does not want the Cat around while Joan is away. In the process, the Cat leaves a trail of destruction throughout the house (such as jumping on the living room couch, baking cupcakes that explode, and ruining Joan's dress by cleaning the wall with it) and releases two troublemakers, named Thing 1 and Thing 2, from a crate which he locks and forbids Conrad to tamper with, explaining that it is a portal to his world. He tells the Things to clean Joan's dress but they instead trash the house as they always do the opposite of what they are told. Despite the Cat's warning, Conrad picks the lock on the crate, which grabs on to the collar of the family's dog Nevins, who the Things throw out the window. While they search for Nevins, the trio find themselves at a birthday party for Sally's former friend Denise. The Cat attempts to hide by posing as a [[pi\u00f1ata]] and is subsequently beaten by the kids.\n\nMeanwhile, Larry is revealed to be an unemployed slob who is in debt, and also a [[con artist]] posing as a successful businessman in order to [[Gold digger|marry Joan for her money]]. He plans to get rid of Conrad by sending him to [[military school]]. While the trio spy on Nevins, they see Larry kidnapping him which prompts them to follow him into the city with the Cat's super-powered car. Upon discovering Larry going into Joan's office, the Cat tricks him into giving them Nevins and they escape. Larry attempts chase but loses them at a party. When they see Larry anxiously riding with Joan, Conrad has the Things stall them by posing as police officers so they can get home first. Despite being held up, Larry witnesses the trio drive past in his car and races after them on the Things' police motorcycle.\n\nWhen the trio return to the house with the lock, Larry cuts them off and orders them inside the house, where he sneezes uncontrollably due to his allergy to the Cat, who takes the advantage and scares him away, only for them to find out that the house has been transformed into \"The Mother of All Messes\", with Larry falling into a gooey abyss within the Cat's world. The trio ride on Mrs. Kwan and navigate through the surreal house to find the crate and lock it, whereupon the house returns to its normal proportions but immediately collapses. In a heated argument, the kids discover that the Cat planned the whole day and order him to leave.\n\nConrad resigns himself to facing the consequences when Joan comes home with Sally sharing the blame, but the Cat returns with a cleaning invention and fixes the house. Conrad and Sally reconcile with the Cat and thank him for everything, and he departs just as Joan arrives. Larry, covered in goo, comes in, thinking he has busted the kids, but when Joan sees the clean house, she does not believe his story and dumps him, which results in his plans being blown up in his face, much to his humiliation and dismay. After the successful party, Joan spends quality time with her kids by jumping on the couch with them, while the Cat and Things 1 and 2 walk off into the sunset.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mike Myers]] as [[the Cat in the Hat]], a 6&nbsp;ft. tall, [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] and humanoid wise-cracking [[cat]] who wears an oversized red [[bow-tie]] and a magical red-and-white striped [[top-hat]] that reveals many humorous gadgets.\n** Myers also makes uncredited cameos as the Cat's disguises throughout the film:\n*** Mr. Catwrench, a mechanic who helps Sally and Conrad fix their couch.\n*** The Guy in the Sweater Who Asks All the Obvious Questions, the blonde-haired and bespectacled host of the fictional TV [[cooking show]] \"Astounding Products\".\n*** Cheshire Cat, a chef from [[Cheshire|Cheshire, England]] who is a guest on \"Astounding Products\".\n*** Zumzizeroo Man, a [[hippie]] who offers a petition to stop the senseless, wholesale slaughter of the fictional flatulating, acid-spitting Zumzizeroo creature to Larry as part of the Cat's plan to rescue Nevins.\n* [[Spencer Breslin]] as Conrad Walden, Joan's destructive and misbehaved 12-year-old son, and the older brother of Sally.\n* [[Dakota Fanning]] as Sally Walden, Joan's dull, somewhat bossy, well-behaved and rule-obeying 8-year-old daughter, and the younger sister of Conrad.\n* [[Kelly Preston]] as Joan Walden, Conrad and Sally's single mother, a [[workaholic]] [[real estate agent]].\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Larry Quinn, the main antagonist; the Waldens' pompous, lazy and unemployed next-door neighbor who is allergic to cats, steals food from the Waldens unnoticed, and is determined to  marry Joan to mooch off of her wealth and wants to send Conrad to [[Military academy|military school]] to get rid of him.\n* [[Amy Hill]] as Mrs. Kwan, an overweight and elderly [[Taiwan]]ese woman who was hired to watch the kids, but sleeps through her job, which (as well as her weight) serves as a [[running gag]].\n* [[Sean Hayes]] as Hank Humberfloob, Joan's zero-tolerance boss, a [[germophobe]] who is seemingly friendly, but is quick to fire employees for even the smallest infractions (such as for shaking his hand which he does not allow since he hates germs), often in an extremely loud tone of voice. \n**Hayes is also the voice of the somewhat cynical, pessimistic and sensible family fish.\n* [[Danielle Chuchran]] and [[Taylor Rice]] as Thing 1, and Brittany Oaks and Talia-Lynn Prairie as Thing 2; two gibbering trouble-making creatures that the Cat brings in with him.

The Cat costume was made of [[Angora wool|angora]] and human [[hair]] and was fitted with a cooling system.

Sean Hayes, who provided the voice for the Fish, found the role significantly different from his usual on-camera jobs; he did not know how the final animation would look, resulting in all of his voice work taking place alone in a sound booth.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=2274 | title=THE CAT IN THE HAT - Production Notes | access-date=March 16, 2012 | page=3 | archive-date=May 12, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512215915/http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=2274 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nPrior to filming, giant props for the film were stolen from the set; the local police found the props vandalized with [[graffiti]] in a [[shopping mall]] car park in [[Pomona, California]].

Because of so much [[smog]] in the area, the sky had to be digitally replaced with the cartoon-like sky and colors of the background had to be digitally fixed. Mike Myers was unaware that a piece of the house would fall behind him near the end of the film during his scenes with [[Spencer Breslin]] and [[Dakota Fanning]].

She also noted that there would be retakes of scenes because Welch, who was a first-time director, let Myers decide whether they were good enough or not.
