The film, starring [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Fredric March]], and [[Ava Gardner]], was directed by [[John Frankenheimer]] from a [[screenplay]] written by [[Rod Serling]] and based on the [[Seven Days in May (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Fletcher Knebel]] and [[Charles W. Bailey II]], published in September 1962.<ref>[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/janet-frame-3/seven-days-in-may/ \"Seven Days in May\" (''Kirkus Reviews'', September 10, 1962)]</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe book was written in late 1961 and into early 1962 during the first year of the [[Kennedy administration]], reflecting some of the events of that era. In November 1961, President [[John F. Kennedy]] accepted the resignation of vociferously [[anti-Communist|anti-communist]] general [[Edwin Walker]], who had been indoctrinating the troops under his command with radical [[right-wing]] ideas and personal political opinions, including describing [[Harry S. Truman]], [[Dean Acheson]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and other active public figures as communist sympathizers.<ref>[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,938238,00.html \"Armed Forces: I Must Be Free...\" (''Time Magazine'', November 10, 1961)]</ref> Although no longer in uniform, Walker continued to make headlines as he ran for [[governor of Texas]] and made speeches promoting strongly right-wing views. In the film version of ''Seven Days in May'', [[Fredric March]], portraying the narrative's fictional president Jordan Lyman, mentions General Walker as one of the \"false prophets\" who were offering themselves to the public as leaders.\n\nAs [[Fletcher Knebel]] and [[Charles W. Bailey II]], primarily political journalists and columnists, collaborated on the novel, they also conducted interviews with another highly controversial military commander, the newly appointed [[Air Force Chief of Staff|Air Force chief of staff]] [[General Curtis LeMay]], who was angry with Kennedy for refusing to provide air support for the Cuban rebels in the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]].<ref>[http://www.washingtonindependentreviewofbooks.com/features/seven-days-in-may-remembrance-of-books-past Stoddard, Brooke C. \"Seven Days in May: Remembrance of Books Past\" (''Washington Independent Review of Books'', November 27, 2012)]</ref><ref>[http://independenthead.blogspot.com/2013/10/seven-days-in-may-by-knebel-and-bailey.html Steed, Mark S. \"Seven Days in May by Knebel and Bailey - Book Review\" (''An Independent Head'', October 26, 2013)]</ref> The character of General James Mattoon Scott was believed to have been inspired by both LeMay and Walker.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}\n\nPresident Kennedy had read the novel [[Seven Days in May (novel)|''Seven Days in May'']] shortly after its publication and believed that the scenario could actually occur in the United States. According to director [[John Frankenheimer]], the project received encouragement and assistance from Kennedy through [[White House Press Secretary|White House press secretary]] [[Pierre Salinger]], who conveyed to Frankenheimer Kennedy's wish that the film be produced. In spite of [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] opposition, Kennedy arranged to visit the [[Kennedy Compound]] in [[Hyannis Port, Massachusetts|Hyannis Port]] for a weekend when the film needed to shoot outside the [[White House]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/books/jfks-last-hundred-days-by-thurston-clarke.html?pagewanted=all Kakutani, Michiko.

U.S. President Jordan Lyman recently signed a [[nuclear disarmament]] treaty with the Soviet Union, and the subsequent ratification by the U.S. Senate has produced a wave of dissatisfaction, especially among Lyman's political opposition and the military, who believe that the Russians cannot be trusted. His popularity has reached an all-time low of 29%, there is rioting about the treaty right outside the White House and he is warned of a dangerous cardiac condition by the presidential physician, which he blithely disregards, too busy and beleaguered to take a prescribed two-week vacation.\n\n[[United States Marine Corps]] colonel \"Jiggs\" Casey is the [[Director of the Joint Staff|director]] of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. He serves its [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|chairman]], [[Four-star rank|four-star]] [[United States Air Force]] [[General (United States)|general]] James Mattoon Scott, a former [[air ace]] who earned six [[Purple Heart]]s, two [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Crosses]] and the [[Medal of Honor]].\n\nCasey stumbles upon evidence that Scott is leading the Joint Chiefs to stage a ''[[coup d'etat]]'' to remove Lyman in seven days. Under the plan, disguised as a training exercise, a secret [[United States Army|army]] unit known as ECOMCON, training at a secret Texas base, will take control of the country's telephone, radio and television networks while the president, participating in a staged \"alert,\" is seized. Scott, who is busy advancing his charismatic public persona through nationally televised anti-treaty rallies, is planned to head a [[military junta]]. Although personally opposed to Lyman's policies, Casey is appalled by the plot and alerts Lyman.\n\nStill somewhat skeptical, Lyman gathers a circle of trusted advisors to investigate: [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] White House detail chief Art Corwin, [[Treasury Secretary]] Christopher Todd, longtime advisor Paul Girard and Raymond Clark, the senior [[U.S. senator]] from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and a close friend of 21 years.\n\nCasey has deduced that the heads of all branches of the U.S. military but the Navy support Scott's coup scheme, with Vice Admiral Barnswell, then aboard an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean, apparently the only invited officer to decline. Lyman cancels a previous commitment to participate in Scott's alert, offering the ruse that he will be away for a fishing weekend. He then dispatches Girard to Gibraltar to obtain Barnswell's confession, sends the alcoholic Clark to Texas to locate the secret base and tasks Casey to gather dirt on the general's private life. Meanwhile, the Secret Service surreptitiously films evidence of an attempt to kidnap the president during the phony fishing trip, removing all doubts about the existence of a plot.\n\nGirard successfully secures Barnswell's confession in writing, but it disappears during a plane crash in Spain. Clark is taken captive when he reaches the secret base and held incommunicado for a day and a half before the Sunday coup. Exploiting Casey's longtime friendship with the base's deputy commander Colonel Henderson, Clark convinces Henderson of the actual intent of the impending \"alert.\" Henderson frees Clark and leads an escape back to Washington but is abducted and confined in a military stockade there. In a video conference with the president, Barnswell denies knowledge of any conspiracy.\n\nKnowing that he cannot prove Scott's guilt, Lyman nevertheless calls Scott to the White House to demand that he and the other conspirators resign. Scott refuses and denies the existence of any plot. Lyman argues that a coup would prompt the Soviets to launch a [[preemptive nuclear strike]]. Scott maintains that the American people are behind him. Lyman challenges him to resign and run for office in order to seek power legitimately, but Scott is unmoved. Lyman restrains himself from confronting Scott with the damning letters that Casey had obtained.\n\nScott meets the other three Joint Chiefs and reasserts his intention to execute the coup. He plans a nighttime network broadcast, but Lyman holds an afternoon press conference to announce that he has fired the four men. As he is speaking, Barnswell's confession, recovered from the plane crash, is handed to him and he delays the conference. In the interim, copies of the confession are delivered to Scott and the other plotters. As the press conference resumes, Scott abandons the plan when Lyman announces that the other three conspirators have resigned.\n\nLyman delivers a speech on the state of the nation and its values, declaring that the nation gains strength through peace rather than by conflict.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Burt Lancaster]] as US Air Force General James Mattoon Scott, [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] \n* [[Kirk Douglas]] as USMC Colonel \"Jiggs\" Casey\n* [[Fredric March]] as US President Jordan Lyman\n* [[Ava Gardner]] as Eleanor Holbrook\n* [[Edmond O'Brien]] as US Senator Ray Clark\n* [[Martin Balsam]] as Paul Girard, [[White House Chief of Staff]]\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Andrew Duggan]] as Colonel \"Mutt\" Henderson, friend of Jiggs Casey\n* [[Hugh Marlowe]] as Harold McPherson, TV commentator who is one of the conspirators\n* [[Whit Bissell]] as US Senator Fred Prentice, another conspirator\n* [[Helen Kleeb]] as Esther Townsend, secretary to the president\n* [[George Macready]] as Chris Todd, [[Secretary of the Treasury]]\n* [[Richard Anderson]] as Colonel Ben Murdock, aid to Scott and a conspirator\n* [[Bart Burns]] as Art Corwin, head of Secret Service\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Uncredited speaking roles (in order of appearance)===\n* [[Malcolm Atterbury]] (Horace, president's physician: \"Why, in God's name, do we elect a man president and then try to see how fast we can kill him?\")\n* [[Jack Mullaney]] (\"All properly decoded in four point oh fashion and respectfully submitted by yours truly, Lieutenant junior grade, Dorsey Grayson.\")\n* Charles Watts (Stu Dillard, Washington insider: \"Oh, Senator, pardon me, come along, I want you to meet the wife of the Indian ambassador.\")\n* [[John Larkin (actor, born 1912)|John Larkin]] (Colonel John Broderick, one of the conspirators: \"Well, well, well, if it isn't my favorite jarhead himself, Jiggs Casey.\")\n* Colette Jackson (Girl speaking to Senator Clark in Charlie's Bar, near secret base in Texas: \"You wonder what the country's comin' to.

Houseman agreed in return for a fine bottle of wine (seen during the telephone scene).<ref name=\"DVD\" />{{Rp|page=1:30:00}} Several scenes, including one with standins for nuns, were shot inside the recently built [[Washington Dulles International Airport]], and the production team was the first to ever film there.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> The alley and car-park scene was shot in Hollywood, and other footage was shot in the Californian desert in 110-degree heat.

Kennedy arranged a visit to the family compound in [[Kennedy Compound|Hyannis Port]] one weekend so that the riot scene could be filmed outside the White House.<ref>{{cite book| author = Arthur Meier Schlesinger| title = Robert Kennedy and His Times| year = 1978| isbn = 978-0-7088-1633-2 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.wcftr.commarts.wisc.edu/collections/featured/kirkdouglas/film/sevendays/7days.html ''Seven Days in May'' commentary as part of the Kirk Douglas Featured Collection at the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610064500/http://wcftr.commarts.wisc.edu/collections/featured/kirkdouglas/film/sevendays/7days.html |date=June 10, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nFrankenheimer considered the scene in which Douglas's character visits the president to be a masterful bit of acting which would have been very difficult for most actors to sustain.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> He had done similar scenes on many television shows, and not only the acting but every camera angle and shot was extensively planned and rehearsed. Frankenheimer paid particular attention to ensuring that all three actors in the scene were in focus for dramatic impact. Many of Frankenheimer's signature techniques were used in scenes such as this throughout the film, including his \"depth of focus\" shot with one or two people near the camera and another or others in the distance and the \"low angle, wide-angle lens\" (set at f/11) which he considered to give \"tremendous impact\" on a scene.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\nThe film is set in 1970, several years in the future from the time of its release. The most obvious efforts are the appearance of the year itself, including on a Pentagon display and the registration sticker on the rear license plate of Senator Prentiss' Bentley sedan. Other nods include a situation room which was designed to seem futuristic, as well as the utilization of then-futuristic technology of video teleconferencing and the recently issued and exotic-looking [[M16 rifle]]. Additionally, the concept of a nuclear treaty between Cold War powers anticipated the actual existence of one.<ref name=\"DVD\" />{{Rp|page=1:45:00}}\n\n[[David Amram]], who had previously scored Frankenheimer's ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962), originally provided music for the film, but Lewis was unsatisfied with his work. [[Jerry Goldsmith]], who had worked with the producer and Douglas on ''[[Lonely Are the Brave]]'' (also 1962) and ''[[The List of Adrian Messenger]]'' (1963), was signed to rescore the project. Goldsmith composed a very brief score (lasting around 15 minutes) using only pianos and percussion; he later scored ''[[Seconds (1966 film)|Seconds]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Challenge (1982 film)|The Challenge]]'' (1982) for Frankenheimer.<ref>Scott Bettencourt, liner notes, soundtrack album, [[Intrada Records|Intrada]] Special Collection Vol. 235</ref> In 2013, [[Intrada Records]] released Goldsmith's music for the film on a limited-edition CD (paired with [[Maurice Jarre]]'s score for ''[[The Mackintosh Man]]''{{Snd}}although that film was produced by [[Warner Bros.]] while ''Seven Days in May'' was theatrically released by Paramount.

In that year's [[Golden Globe Award]]s, O'Brien won for Best Supporting Actor, and Fredric March, John Frankenheimer and composer Jerry Goldsmith received nominations.\n\nFrankenheimer won a Danish [[Bodil Award]] for directing the Best Non-European Film, and Rod Serling was nominated for a [[Writers Guild of America Award]] for Best Written American Drama.\n\n===Evaluation in film guides===\n''[[Steven H. Scheuer's Movies on TV]]'' (1972\u201373 edition) gives ''Seven Days in May'' its highest rating of 4 stars, recommending it as \"an exciting suspense drama concerned with politics and the problems of sanity and survival in a nuclear age\", with the concluding sentences stating, \"benefits from taut screenplay by Rod Serling and the direction of John Frankenheimer, which artfully builds interest leading to the finale. March is a standout in a uniformly fine cast. So many American-made films dealing with political subjects are so naive and simple-minded that the thoughtful and, in this case, the optimistic statement of the film is a welcome surprise.\" By the 1986\u201387 edition, Scheuer's rating was lowered to 3\u00bd and the conclusion shortened to, \"which artfully builds to the finale\", with the final sentences deleted. ''[[Leonard Maltin's TV Movies & Video Guide]]'' (1989 edition) gives it a still lower 3 stars (out of 4), originally describing it as an \"absorbing story of military scheme to overthrow the government\", with later editions (including 2014) adding one word, \"absorbing, ''believable'' story...\"\n\n''Videohound's Golden Movie Retriever'' follows Scheuer's later example, with 3\u00bd bones (out of 4), calling it a \"topical but still gripping Cold War nuclear-peril thriller\" and, in the end, \"highly suspenseful, with a breathtaking climax.\" ''Mick Martin's & Marsha Porter's DVD & Video Guide'' also puts its rating high, at 4 stars (out of 5) finding it, as ''Videohound'' did, \"a highly suspenseful account of an attempted military takeover...\" and indicating that \"the movie's tension snowballs toward a thrilling conclusion. This is one of those rare films that treat their audiences with respect.\" Assigning the equally high rating of 4 stars (out of 5), ''[[The Motion Picture Guide]]'' begins its description with \"a taut, gripping, and suspenseful political thriller which sports superb performances from the entire cast\", goes to state, in the middle, that \"proceeding to unravel its complicated plot at a rapid clip, ''SEVEN DAYS IN MAY'' is a surprisingly exciting film that also packs a grim warning\", and ends with \"Lancaster underplays the part of the slightly crazed general and makes him seem quite rational and persuasive. It is a frightening performance. Douglas is also quite good as the loyal aide who uncovers the fantastic plot that could destroy the entire country. March, Balsam, O'Brien, Bissell, and Houseman all turn in topnotch performances and it is through their conviction that the viewer becomes engrossed in this outlandish tale.\"\n\nBritish references also show high regard for the film, with ''[[TimeOut Film Guide]]''{{'}}s founding editor [[Tom Milne]] indicating that \"conspiracy movies may have become more darkly complex in these post-[[Watergate]] days of [[Alan J. Pakula|Pakula]] and paranoia, but Frankenheimer's fascination with gadgetry (in his compositions, the ubiquitous helicopters, TV screens, hidden cameras and electronic devices literally edge the human characters into insignificance) is used to create a striking visual metaphor for control by the military machine. Highly enjoyable.\" In his ''Film Guide'', [[Leslie Halliwell]] provided 3 stars (out of 4), describing it as an \"absorbing political mystery drama marred only by the unnecessary introduction of a female character. Stimulating entertainment.\" [[David Shipman (writer)|David Shipman]] in his 1984 ''The Good Film and Video Guide'' gives 2 (out of 4) stars, noting that it is \"a tense political thriller whose plot is plotting\".\n\n==Remake==\nThe film was remade in 1994 by HBO as ''[[The Enemy Within (1994 film)|The Enemy Within]]'' with [[Sam Waterston]] as President William Foster, [[Jason Robards]] as General R. Pendleton Lloyd, and [[Forest Whitaker]] as Colonel MacKenzie 'Mac' Casey. This version followed many parts of the original plot closely, while updating it for the [[Post\u2013Cold War era|post\u2013Cold War]] world, omitting certain incidents and changing the ending.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Novels|Film}}\n*[[List of American films of 1964]]\n* [[Politics in fiction]]\n* ''[[A Very British Coup (mini-series)|A Very British Coup]]'', a 1988 three-episode serial, based on [[Chris Mullin (politician)|Chris Mullin]]'s novel about an attempted right-wing overthrow of a left-wing British government\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |last=Bamford |first=James |author-link=James Bamford |year=2001 |chapter=Chapter 4: Fists |title=[[Body of Secrets|Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency: From the Cold War Through the Dawn of a New Century]] |chapter-url=https://www.amazon.com/reader/0385499078 |location=New York |publisher=Doubleday |isbn=978-0-385-49907-1 |oclc=44713235 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bodyofsecretsana00bamf/page/80 80\u201391]}} Covers an actual plot during the Kennedy administration and within the Joint Chiefs of Staff to start a war.\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0058576|title=Seven Days in May}}\n* {{AFI film|23341|Seven Days in May}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=16136|title=Seven Days in May}}\n* {{amg title|43837|Seven Days in May}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|seven_days_in_may|Seven Days in May}}\n* [http://movies.tvguide.com/theres-always-tomorrow/review/117287 ''Seven Days in May''] at ''[[TV Guide]]'' (revised form of this 1987 write-up was originally published in ''The Motion Picture Guide'')\n\n{{John Frankenheimer}}\n{{Bryna Productions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seven Days In May}}\n[[Category:1964 films]]\n[[Category:1960s political thriller films]]\n[[Category:American political thriller films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Bryna Productions films]]\n[[Category:Cold War films]]\n[[Category:United States presidential succession in fiction]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Jerry Goldsmith]]\n[[Category:Films about coups d'\u00e9tat]]\n[[Category:Films about fictional presidents of the United States]]\n[[Category:Films about nuclear war and weapons]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on thriller novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Frankenheimer]]\n[[Category:Films set in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Films set in Texas]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1970]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:Films about United States Army Special Forces]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Rod Serling]]\n[[Category:Films about World War III]]\n[[Category:American neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films set in Spain]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1960s American films]]"}]}}}}
