Miller|Stephen Miller]] (producer and co-writer of the original film). Serving as a\u00a0[[remake]]\u00a0of [[My Bloody Valentine (film)|the\u00a01981 Canadian slasher film of the same name]], it stars\u00a0[[Jensen Ackles]],\u00a0[[Jaime King]],\u00a0[[Kerr Smith]], [[Tom Atkins (actor)|Tom Atkins]], and\u00a0[[Kevin Tighe]]. The film focuses on the residents of a small town that is plagued by a serial killer in mining gear on\u00a0[[Valentine's Day]].\n\nAfter filming on location in [[Pennsylvania]], the film was given a [[3-D film|3D theatrical release]] in the United States by [[Lionsgate]]. It was the first [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R-rated]] film to be projected in [[RealD Cinema|RealD]] technology and to have a wide release (1,000 locations) in 3D-enabled theaters.\n\n''My Bloody Valentine 3D''\u00a0was released in the United States on January 16, 2009, by [[Lionsgate]]. The film grossed $100.7 million worldwide on a budget of $14 million and received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, who praised its performances and production values, but some critics found it to be \"formulaic\" and \"generic\", criticizing its screenplay, the wooden characters and the 3-D technology.\n\n==Plot==\nOn [[Valentine's Day]] 1997, six miners are trapped underground by an explosion at the Hanniger mine in the small mining community of Harmony. By the time rescuers reach the miners, they find only comatose Harry Warden still alive. Further investigation reveals that Warden killed the other miners to conserve oxygen. Tom Hanniger, son of the mine's owner, is blamed for the explosion as he forgot to vent the [[methane]] lines that caused the collapse.\n\nOne year later, Warden has awakened from his coma and is now murdering as an act of revenge. He starts by killing numerous patients and staff at the hospital where he was a patient, leaving a victim's heart in a box of chocolates. While Tom, his girlfriend Sarah, their friends Irene and Axel, and other teenagers party inside the mine, Warden \u2013 wearing mining gear and a gas mask \u2013 attacks them with a [[pickaxe]]. Sarah, Irene, and Axel escape but Tom is left behind with Warden. Sheriff Burke arrives and shoots Warden before he can kill the severely traumatized Tom, but Warden staggers away deeper into the mine.\n\nTen years later, Tom returns to Harmony after his father dies. He is selling the mine, which angers mine manager Ben Foley. Axel, now the town's sheriff, has married Sarah but is having an affair with her coworker Megan. At the motel where Tom is staying, a masked assailant murders Irene and two other people. Camera footage from the scene reveals the killer dressed as a miner, starting rumors that Warden has returned. Axel receives a chocolate box containing Irene's heart. Meanwhile, Tom reconnects with Sarah and apologizes for his ten-year absence.\n\nLooking for Foley in the mine, Tom is locked inside a utility cage by the Miner, who murders the worker accompanying Tom and vanishes before help arrives. Tom insists that Warden has returned, but Axel reveals that Foley and Sheriff Burke found and killed Warden after his attack ten years ago. The group visits the woods where Warden's body was buried, but find that the grave is empty. Tom resolves to track down and stop Warden. Searching the woods, he finds the shack that Axel and Megan have been using for their affair. That night, the Miner kills Foley and leaves his body in Warden's grave. Axel realizes the killer must be one of the few people aware of the grave, and he becomes increasingly suspicious of Tom.\n\nThe Miner attacks Sarah and Megan, killing Megan just before Axel arrives. Sarah is hospitalized with minor wounds. The Miner then kills former sheriff Burke as well as the maid of Axel and Sarah's home. Tom shows up at the hospital, telling Sarah he has to show her something he found in Axel's cabin. She checks herself out and accompanies Tom. As they drive, Tom suggests that Axel is the killer. Axel calls and urges Sarah to get away from Tom, whom he says is the killer; Axel has discovered that Tom spent the last seven years in a mental institution. Tom becomes increasingly agitated and Sarah, believing Axel, grabs the wheel and crashes the car before escaping into the woods.\n\nSarah hides in Axel's cabin. There she discovers evidence of Axel's affair and a tower of empty valentine gift boxes. The Miner appears and chases her into the mine. She is hiding in the mine when Axel arrives, and Sarah grabs his gun. Tom shows up, and Sarah holds the two men at gunpoint as they each accuse the other of being the killer. Tom, however, mentions the way Megan was killed, inadvertently revealing he is the killer. As Sarah points the gun at him, Tom hallucinates, revealing the Miner is his split personality. A flashback shows him digging up Warden's mining gear and committing the murders. After a struggle, Sarah shoots Tom, and the bullet strikes a fuel tank, which explodes. Sarah and Axel are rescued from the resulting cave-in. Tom also survives, murdering the rescue worker who finds him and escaping in the worker's gear.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jensen Ackles]] as Tom Hanniger\n* Chris Carnel as [[Harry Warden|The Miner]]\n* [[Jaime King]] as Sarah Mercer-Palmer\n* [[Kerr Smith]] as Sheriff Axel Palmer\n* [[Betsy Rue]] as Irene\n* [[Megan Boone]] as Megan\n* [[Edi Gathegi]] as Deputy Martin\n* [[Tom Atkins (actor)|Tom Atkins]] as Sheriff Jim Burke\n* [[Kevin Tighe]] as Ben Foley\n* Karen Baum as Deputy Ferris\n* Joy de la Paz as Rosa\n* [[Marc Macaulay]] as Marc Riggs\n* [[Selene Luna]] as Selene\n* [[Todd Farmer]] as Frank, The Trucker\n* Jeff Hochendoner as William \"Red\" Kirkpatrick\n* [[Bingo O'Malley]] as Officer Hinch \n* [[Richard John Walters]] as [[Harry Warden|Harry Warden / The Miner]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in Southwestern Pennsylvania, taking advantage of the state's tax incentives for film productions as well as the topographical and architectural versatility of the Pittsburgh Metro area.

He also makes effective use of the depth-of-field illusion, allowing audiences long views of various chest cavities from which hearts have been rudely ripped. At the very least, the overall tech package is a great deal more impactful than that of the 3-D-lensed ''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'' (1982)\". He added, in spite of the \"state-of-the-art 3-D camera trickery, which helmer Patrick Lussier shamelessly exploits to goose the audience with cheap thrills and full-bore gore, ''My Bloody Valentine'' is at heart an unabashedly retro work, reveling in the cliches and conventions of the slasher horror pics that proliferated in the early 1980s\".<ref>{{cite journal | last = Leydon | first = Joe | title = My Bloody Valentine | journal = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = January 16, 2009 | url = https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117939353.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 | access-date = January 26, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nMark Olsen of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said, the implemented 3-D technology enables \"startling effects, but after a while the minor thrill of the trick is gone.

Patrick Lussier's film is the most accomplished example. The 3-D effects come fast and furious, rendered with a technical skill and humor that gives this otherwise strictly formulaic slasher picture whatever entertainment value it possesses\". He added that \"the three leads actually manage to invest their roles with some depth, but the real acting treats come courtesy of veteran character actors Kevin Tighe and Atkins, whose presence provides a comforting bridge to horror films past\".\n\n===Home media===\n''My Bloody Valentine 3D'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] on May 19, 2009 and has grossed in excess of $19.7 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2009/MBVAL-DVD.php|title=The Numbers}}</ref> with DVD sales and theater gross revenue totaling over $119.9 million.\n\nBoth home release versions have both a standard 2D version and the 3D version on the same disc using [[seamless branching]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/2158/mybloodyvalentine2009.html|title=High-Def Digest}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2010, Lionsgate Home Entertainment released ''My Bloody Valentine 3D'' on Blu-ray 3D which requires a 3D-capable HDTV, 3D Blu-ray player and 3D glasses. The disc also includes a 2D version of the film and all bonus materials included in the 2D Blu-ray version released after the film's initial theater run.\n\n==Cancelled sequel==\nIn March 2020, in an interview with [[Bloody Disgusting]], writer Todd Farmer revealed that himself and director Patrick Lussier both pitched a script for a sequel to the remake to [[Lionsgate]] executives John Sacchi and Michael Paseornek two weeks ahead of the film's release. After the film received mixed reviews from critics, Lionsgate lost interest. The sequel would have been more psychological and would have brought back survivors from the remake as well as expanded upon its backstory.
