Shortly after moving in, Bill finds a dollhouse (modeled after [[The Amityville Horror|112 Ocean Avenue]]) in the shed. He brings it into the house and puts it in the garage. Later that night, Bill notices the fireplace in the house turns on by itself, heating the entire home. He has a hallucination of his daughter Jessica burning to death in the fireplace. The following morning, Claire finds the dollhouse in the garage and suggests giving it to Jessica for her birthday. At her birthday party, Jessica's aunt Marla and uncle Tobias arrive. Jessica is elated over the dollhouse and finds a chest of miniature dolls inside it. Her aunt and uncle, however, seem inexplicably nervous regarding the toys.\n\nIn the ensuing days, numerous strange incidents occur: Jimmy, Claire's eldest son, loses his pet mouse, which finds its way into the dollhouse; simultaneously, Jessica is confronted by an enormous white mouse hiding under her bed. Claire also begins to have unexpected [[Sexual desire|sexual urges]] toward Todd, Bill's eldest son, and fantasizes about him while having sex with Bill. Nightmares plague Bill about [[voodoo doll]]s, demons, and his family being murdered. In conversation with Marla, Bill reveals he suffered from similar dreams as a child, including a [[precognition|premonitory dream]] of his parents dying in a fire, which came true. Jimmy also experiences supernatural visitations from his deceased father, who appears to him as a decaying zombie, urging him to murder Bill.\n\nOne afternoon, Todd brings his girlfriend, Dana, to the home. While in an exterior shed on the property, the two find newspaper clippings about the foundation on which Bill built their new home: they surmise that the new house was built around the fireplace from the original home. The two begin to have sex, but a giant fly attacks them and tries to burrow into Todd's ear. The following evening, Bill and Claire go out for dinner, leaving Todd to babysit Jimmy and Jessica. Todd invites Dana over and sends the children to bed. While Todd makes [[cocktail]]s in the kitchen, Dana's hair inexplicably catches fire, leaving her in a coma with disfiguring burns. Todd blames his father for the accident, believing a faulty coil in the fireplace's gas line caused it.\n\nMeanwhile, Marla and Tobias, who apparently practice magic, have taken one of the dolls from Jessica's dollhouse. They perform a ritual on the doll and watch it come to life. Objects begin to fly around their home, and Tobias stabs the doll with a knife, after which a large fly escapes. Later, Claire finds an unexplained bruise on Jimmy's face and believes Bill hit him. She shuts him out of the house, only to be confronted by the zombie of her deceased husband, tying her and Jimmy up and forcing them to sit by the fireplace. Bill attempts to enter the house through the garage but is knocked unconscious by [[carbon monoxide]] fumes from his car, which begins running by itself. Tobias arrives at the home and is able to save Bill. The two enter the home: Tobias has the voodoo doll he had taken from the dollhouse with him.\n\nTobias and Bill fight with the zombie, and Jimmy throws the voodoo doll into the fireplace, causing the zombie to disappear. Todd is then visited by an apparition of Dana, who is in the hospital: she attempts to kill him, but Claire intercedes. The family attempts to flee the house but cannot find Jessica. Scrawled on a piece of paper, they find a list of observations Jessica has made about the dollhouse, one of which reads: \"My hand disappears in the fireplace.\" Bill realizes the fireplace is a portal to somewhere else. Bill and Tobias enter the fireplace and realize they have entered the dollhouse. They find Jessica on the floor, surrounded by bloodied remnants of the voodoo dolls. Tobias casts a protective spell, allowing Bill and Jessica to flee: Tobias, however, is dragged away by the demons that have escaped from the dolls. Bill destroys the dollhouse by tossing it into the fireplace. As they flee in their car, the house explodes behind them.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robin Thomas]] as Bill Martin\n* [[Starr Andreeff]] as Claire Martin (credited as Star Adreeff)\n* Allen Cutler as Todd Martin\n* Rachel Duncan as Jessica Martin\n* Jarrett Lennon as Jimmy Martin\n* Clayton Murray as Jimmy's Father\n* Franc Ross as Tobias\n* [[Lenore Kasdorf]] as Marla Martin\n* [[Lisa Robin Kelly]] as Dana\n\n==Musical score==\n{{Infobox album|\n| name       = Amityville Dollhouse\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Ray Colcord]]\n| cover      = \n| caption    =\n| alt        =\n| released   = June 1, 1999\n| recorded   = 1996\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = {{hlist|[[Film score]]}}\n| length     = 45:18\n| label      = [[Citadel Records|Citadel]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\nThe film features an official score by composer [[Ray Colcord]], which was released on compact disc in 1999.<ref name=score>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/amityville-dollhouse-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-mw0000667379|title=Amityville Dollhouse [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]|author=Phares, Heather|work=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=10 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing     =  \n| collapsed=\n\n| title1          =Main Title \n| length1=2:51\n\n| title2      = Dana/Dead Dad\n| length2     = 4:49\n\n| title3      = Todd's Photo\n| length3     = 1:55\n\n| title4      = Seance\n| length4     = 2:18\n\n| title5      = Wasp\n| length5     = 1:58\n\n| title6      = More Dead Dad\n| length6     = 3:18\n\n| title7      = Battle\n| length7     = 7:24\n\n| title8      = I Had a Dream\n| length8     = 1:09\n\n| title9      = It's Alive\n| length9     = 1:56\n\n| title10     = Bill's Dream\n| length10    = 1:14\n\n| title11     = You Did This\n| length11    = 0:45\n\n| title12     = Father\n| length12    = 2:28\n\n| title13     = Claire's Fantasy \n| length13    = 1:29\n\n| title14     = Monster Mouse\n| length14    = 0:31\n\n| title15     = Dana 451\n| length15    = 2:07\n\n| title16     = Shed\n| length16    = 1:32\n\n| title17     = Dig We Must\n| length17    = 2:21\n\n| title18     = Rotten Day\n| length18    = 1:34\n\n| title19     = Dad Again\n| length19    = 0:44\n\n| title20     = Along Came a Spider\n| length20    = 0:40\n\n| title21     = Epilogue\n| length21    = 3:08\n| writer21= {{hlist|Colcord|Sam Cardon}}\n}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released on [[VHS]] by [[Republic Pictures]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/458406/Amityville-Dollhouse/|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|title=Amityville Dollhouse (1997)|accessdate=10 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Phantom of the Movies' Videoscope: The Ultimate Guide to the Latest, Greatest, and Weirdest Genre Videos|author=Kane, Joe|page=7|publisher=Three Rivers Press|year=2000|isbn= 978-0-812-93149-5|author-link=Joe Kane}}</ref> in 1996 and later on DVD by [[Lionsgate]] on September 28, 2004.<ref name=rt>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/amityville_dollhouse_evil_never_dies/|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|title=Amityville Dollhouse|accessdate=9 September 2017}}</ref> In 2019, [[Vinegar Syndrome]] (under license from Multicom Entertainment Group) released the film on [[Blu-ray]] in the US which was included in the boxset \u2018Amityville: The Cursed Collection\u2019.
