R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings|high fantasy epic novel of the same name]], comprising ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' and some material from both books of ''[[The Two Towers]]''. Set in [[Middle-earth]], the film follows a group of [[Hobbit]]s, [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], an [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]], a [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]] and a [[Wizards (Middle-earth)|Wizard]] who form a [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|fellowship]]. They embark on a quest to destroy the [[One Ring]] made by the Dark Lord [[Sauron]]; he has put much of his power into the Ring, and with it would control the whole of Middle-earth, but if it were destroyed, he would perish with it.\n\nBakshi encountered Tolkien's writing early in his career. He had made several attempts to produce ''The Lord of the Rings'' as an animated film before producer [[Saul Zaentz]] and distributor [[United Artists]] provided funding. The film is notable for its extensive use of [[rotoscoping]], a technique in which scenes are first shot in live-action, then traced onto animation [[cel]]s. It uses a hybrid of [[Traditional animation#Cels|traditional cel animation]] and rotoscoped live action footage.<ref name=\"PM\">{{cite news |last=Ma\u00e7ek |first=J.

The screenplay was written by [[Peter S. Beagle]], based on an earlier draft by [[Chris Conkling]].\n\nAlthough Bakshi's ''The Lord of the Rings'' was a financial success, it received mixed reactions from critics, and hostility from disappointed viewers who felt that it was incomplete; there was no official sequel to cover the remainder of the story. Nonetheless, the film was an influence on [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|trilogy]] in the early 2000s, as detailed in the DVD extras of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nEarly in the [[Second Age]] of [[Middle-earth]], [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elven]] smiths forge nine [[Rings of Power]] for mortal [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], seven for the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf-Lords]], and three for the Elf-Kings. Soon after, the Dark Lord [[Sauron]] makes the [[One Ring]], and uses it to attempt to conquer Middle-earth. After defeating Sauron, Prince [[Isildur]] takes the Ring, but after he is killed by [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]], the Ring lies at the bottom of the river [[Anduin]] for over 2,500 years. Over time, Sauron captures the Nine Rings and transforms their owners into the [[Nazg\u00fbl|Ringwraiths]]. The One Ring is discovered by [[D\u00e9agol]], whose kinsman, Sm\u00e9agol, kills him and takes the Ring for himself. The Ring twists his body and mind, and he becomes the creature [[Gollum]] ([[Peter Woodthorpe]]) who takes it with him into the [[Misty Mountains]]. Hundreds of years later, [[Bilbo Baggins]] ([[Norman Bird]]) finds the Ring in Gollum's cave and brings it back with him to the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]].\n\nDecades later, during Bilbo's birthday celebration, the Wizard [[Gandalf]] ([[William Squire]]) tells him to leave the Ring for his nephew [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] ([[Christopher Guard]]). Bilbo reluctantly agrees, and departs for [[Rivendell]]. Seventeen years pass, during which Gandalf learns that evil forces have discovered that the Ring is in the possession of a Baggins. Gandalf meets Frodo to explain the Ring's history and the danger it poses, and Frodo leaves his home, taking the Ring with him. He is accompanied by three Hobbits, his cousins, [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] ([[Dominic Guard]]), [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] ([[Simon Chandler]]), and his gardener [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] (Michael Scholes). After a narrow escape from the Ringwraiths, the hobbits eventually come to [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], from which [[Aragorn]] ([[John Hurt]]) leads them to Rivendell. Frodo is stabbed atop [[Weathertop]] mountain by the [[Witch-king of Angmar|chief of the Ringwraiths]], and becomes sickened as the journey progresses. The Ringwraiths catch up with them shortly after they meet the Elf [[Legolas]] ([[Anthony Daniels]]); and at a standoff at the ford of Rivendell, the Ringwraiths are swept away by the river.\n\nAt Rivendell, Frodo is healed by [[Elrond]] ([[Andr\u00e9 Morell]]). He meets Gandalf again, after the latter escapes the corrupt wizard [[Saruman]] (Fraser Kerr), who plans to ally with Sauron but also wants the Ring for himself. Frodo volunteers to go to [[Mordor]], where the Ring can be destroyed. Thereafter Frodo sets off from Rivendell with eight companions: Gandalf; Aragorn; [[Boromir]] ([[Michael Graham Cox]]), son of the [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward]] of [[Gondor]]; Legolas; [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] ([[David Buck]]) the Dwarf, along with Pippin, Merry, and Sam.\n\nTheir attempt to cross the Misty Mountains is foiled by heavy snow, and they are forced into [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]]. There, they are attacked by Orcs, and Gandalf falls into an [[wikt:abyss|abyss]] while battling a [[Balrog]]. The remaining Fellowship continue through the Elf-haven [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], where they meet the Elf queen [[Galadriel]] ([[Annette Crosbie]]). Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo, and Frodo decides to continue his quest alone; but Sam insists on accompanying him. Boromir is killed by Orcs while trying to defend Merry and Pippin. Merry and Pippin are captured by the Orcs, who intend to take them to [[Isengard]] through the land of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]]. The captured hobbits escape and flee into [[Fangorn Forest]], where they meet [[Treebeard]] ([[John Westbrook (actor)|John Westbrook]]). Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas track Merry and Pippin into the forest, where they are reunited with Gandalf, who was reborn after destroying the Balrog.\n\nThe five then ride to Rohan's capital, [[Edoras]], where Gandalf persuades King [[Th\u00e9oden]] ([[Philip Stone]]) that his people are in danger. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas then travel to the [[Helm's Deep]]. Frodo and Sam discover Gollum stalking them in an attempt to reclaim the Ring, and capture him; but spare his life in return for guidance to Mount Doom. Gollum eventually begins plotting against them, and wonders if the giant spider [[Shelob]] might help. At Helm's Deep, Th\u00e9oden's forces resist the Orcs sent by Saruman, until Gandalf arrives with the absent Riders of Rohan, destroying the Orc army.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Christopher Guard]] as [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]\n* [[William Squire]] as [[Gandalf]]\n* Michael Scholes as [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]]\n* [[John Hurt]] as [[Aragorn II Elessar|Aragorn]]\n* [[Simon Chandler]] as [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |author-link=Vincent Canby |title=The Lord of the Rings |date=November 15, 1978 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B02E7DF1731E432A25756C1A9679D946990D6CF |access-date=December 21, 2020 |archive-date=October 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030010724/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B02E7DF1731E432A25756C1A9679D946990D6CF |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Dominic Guard]] as [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]\n* [[Norman Bird]] as [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]\n* [[Michael Graham Cox]] as [[Boromir]]\n* [[Anthony Daniels]] as [[Legolas]]\n* [[David Buck]] as [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]]\n* [[Peter Woodthorpe]] as [[Gollum]]\n* Fraser Kerr as [[Saruman]]\n* [[Philip Stone]] as [[Th\u00e9oden]]\n* [[Michael Deacon (actor)|Michael Deacon]] as [[Gr\u00edma Wormtongue|Wormtongue]]\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Morell]] as [[Elrond]]\n* [[Alan Tilvern]] as [[Bree (Middle-earth)#Barliman Butterbur|Innkeeper]]\n* [[Annette Crosbie]] as [[Galadriel]]\n* [[John Westbrook (actor)|John Westbrook]] as [[Treebeard]]<ref name=\"Beck\"/>\n{{Div col end}}\n\nThis primary cast was supported by a large cast<!--list deleted--> of animation doubles, who were not credited on screen; the matter went to guild arbitration.<ref name=\"Langford in Drout 2007\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Langford |first=Barry |chapter=Bakshi, Ralph (1938\u2013) |editor-last=Drout |editor-first=Michael D.

The biggest challenge was to be true to the book.\"<ref name=\"Korkis\"/> When asked what he was trying to accomplish with the film, Bakshi stated \"The goal was to bring as much quality as possible to the work. I wanted real illustration as opposed to cartoons.\"<ref name=\"Korkis\"/> Bakshi said that descriptions of the characters were not included because they are seen in the film. He stated that the key thing was not \"how a hobbit looks\", since everyone has their own idea of such things, but that \"the energy of Tolkien survives\".<ref name=\"Korkis\"/> In his view what mattered was whether the quality of animation was enough to make the movie work.<ref name=\"Korkis\"/>\n\nBakshi was aware of the work of illustrators like the [[Brothers Hildebrandt]], without accepting that their style had driven his approach;<ref name=\"Naha\">{{Cite journal |last=Naha |first=Ed |title=The Lord of the Rings: Bakshi in the Land of Hollywood Hobbits |journal=Starlog |volume=19 |date=June 1992}}</ref> he stated that the film presented a clash of many styles, as in his other films.<ref name=\"Korkis\"/>\n\n===Animation===\n\nPublicity for the film announced that Bakshi had created \"the first movie painting\" by utilizing \"an entirely new technique in filmmaking\".<ref name=\"Korkis\"/> Much of the film used live-action footage which was then [[Rotoscoping|rotoscope]]d to produce an animated look.<ref name=\"Korkis\"/> This saved production costs and gave the animated characters a more realistic look. In animation historian [[Jerry Beck]]'s ''The Animated Movie Guide'', reviewer Marea Boylan writes that \"up to that point, animated films had not depicted extensive battle scenes with hundreds of characters. By using the rotoscope, Bakshi could trace highly complex scenes from live-action footage and transform them into animation, thereby taking advantage of the complexity live-action film could capture without incurring the exorbitant costs of producing a live-action film.\"<ref name=\"Beck\"/> Bakshi rejected the Disney approach which he thought \"cartoony\", arguing that his approach, while not traditional for rotoscoping, created a feeling of realism involving up to a thousand characters in a scene.<ref name=\"Korkis\"/>\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including Christopher Guard, William Squire, Michael Scholes, Anthony Daniels, and John Hurt. Daniels remembers that \"The whole cast were in the same studio but we all had to leave a two second gap between the lines which made for rather stilted dialogue.''\"''<ref>{{cite web |last=Daniels |first=Anthony |author-link=Anthony Daniels |publisher=Anthony Daniels<!--published author, see WP article--> |title=Anthony Daniels interview |url=http://www.anthonydaniels.com/qa/qa/content.html |access-date=December 21, 2020 |archive-date=February 25, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225085452/http://www.anthonydaniels.com/qa/qa/content.html |url-status=live }}</ref> For the live-action portion of the production, Bakshi and his cast and crew went to Spain, where the rotoscope models acted out their parts in costume in the open or in empty soundstages.

I learned lots of things about the process, like rippling.

R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'', noted the film's deficiencies, including the \"glaringly evident\"<ref name=\"Langford in Drout 2007\"/> weaknesses in the rotoscoping animation. The quality of rotoscoping from filmed live action is limited by the quality of the acting, which, given the lack of rehearsal and time for retakes, was not high. The prologue was not rotoscoped, but shot as \"silhouetted dumb show through red filters\",<ref name=\"Langford in Drout 2007\"/> revealing clumsy mime and confused voiceover, announcing that [[Mordor]] defeated Elves and Men at the Battle of Dagorlad, which Langford observes would make the rest of the action incomprehensible. The small budget led to underwhelming battle scenes, as in the [[Mines of Moria]] where the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] is confronted by what looks like a very small force of Orcs. The rotoscoping varies from strongly drawn to almost absent, leading to a markedly uneven treatment through the film. The characterisation, in Langford's view, similarly leaves much to be desired.<ref name=\"Langford in Drout 2007\"/>\n\n===Influence on Peter Jackson's ''The Lord of the Rings'' ===\n\nThe film has been cited as an influence on director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]], although Jackson said that \"our film is stylistically very different and the design is different.\"<ref name=\":4\">{{cite AV media |last=Jackson |first=Peter |title=The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, Director's Commentary |year=2001 |publisher=[[New Line Cinema]]}}</ref><!-- Jackson had watched Bakshi's previous films, including ''Wizards'', and at the age of seventeen went to see the film when it premiered in New Zealand.

A few weeks after watching the film, he bought a tie-in single-volume, paperback edition of the book, followed up by ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Silmarillion'', as well as a recording of the 1981 radio adaptation, in which two of Bakshi's cast reprised their roles.{{cn}}--> Reading about attempts to make the films live-action by Boorman and The Beatles contacting Kubrick and Lean to do the same, Jackson agreed animation was the most sensible choice at the time.
