The film was created from a screenplay by [[Richard Price (writer)|Richard Price]], based on the [[The Color of Money (novel)|1984 novel of the same name]] by [[Walter Tevis]]. The film stars [[Paul Newman]] and [[Tom Cruise]], with [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Helen Shaver]], and [[John Turturro]] in supporting roles. It features an original score by [[Robbie Robertson]], and was released on October 17, 1986, after a premier a week earlier at the [[Ziegfeld Theater]] in New York City in New York. The film grossed $52.3 million at the box office.\n\nThe film continues the story of [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]] [[Hustling|hustler]] and {{Cuegloss|stakehorse}} Edward \"Fast Eddie\" Felson from Tevis's first novel, ''[[The Hustler (novel)|The Hustler]]'' (1959), with Newman reprising his role from the [[The Hustler|1961 film adaptation]]. It begins more than 25 years after the events of the previous film, with Eddie retired from the [[pool (cue sport)|pool]] circuit. Newman won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance, his first Oscar win after seven nominations. The film centered around the game of [[nine-ball]], a pool variant played for high stakes. A challenge nine-ball match was named after it in 1997 at which [[Efren Reyes]] defeated [[Earl Strickland]] to win the largest single match purse in pool history of $100,000.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film continues the story of pool hustler and stakehorse Edward \"Fast Eddie\" Felson from the novel ''The Hustler''.<ref name=\"roge_TheC\" /> Felson is a former [[pool (cue sports)|pool]] [[hustling|hustler]] turned successful liquor salesman in [[Chicago]]. He still stakes bets for players, including fellow hustler Julian, who is outmatched at [[nine-ball]] by the young and charismatic Vincent Lauria. Recognizing Vincent's skill, and his girlfriend Carmen's inexperience at luring players to lose money, Eddie tells the couple of their excellent potential for hustling.\n\nCarmen visits Eddie alone to inquire about his interest in Vincent. Finding him working at [[Child World]], Eddie invites Vincent to leave the next day for six weeks of hustling on the road, culminating in a nine-ball tournament in [[Atlantic City]]. Manipulating Vincent's insecurities about Carmen and giving him a valuable [[George Balabushka|Balabushka]] cue stick, Eddie persuades him to accept his offer. Eddie's abrupt departure upsets Julian, as well as Eddie's girlfriend Janelle.\n\nVincent and Carmen hit the road with Eddie in his [[Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham|Cadillac]], visiting a series of [[billiard hall|pool halls]]. Serving as Vincent's {{Cuegloss|stake|stakehorse}}, Eddie attempts to teach him the art of hustling, but Vincent chafes at having to play below his ability. At a pool hall run by his old acquaintance Orvis, Eddie becomes fed up with Vincent's arrogance and leaves him. In Vince's absence, Eddie reminds Carmen they are partners with a mutual business interest in Vincent. Eddie returns to find Vincent grandstanding to \u201c[[Werewolves of London]]\u201d, beating the pool hall's best player but scaring off a wealthier {{Cuegloss|mark}}. Eddie and Vincent talk frankly, agreeing Vincent must curb his ego if they are to succeed.\n\nEddie and Carmen struggle to rein in Vincent's showboating, and his jealousy when they pose as lovers during a scam. After a string of successful games, Vincent plays the famed Grady Seasons, but is directed by Eddie to {{Cuegloss|dump}} the game, to inflate the odds against Vincent in Atlantic City. Goaded by Grady, Vincent almost fails to throw the game, and Eddie is inspired to play again. After some success, Eddie is taken by a {{Cuegloss|Shark|pool shark}} named Amos. Humiliated, Eddie leaves Vincent and Carmen with enough money to make it to Atlantic City, taking the Balabushka.\n\nEddie refines his skills at Orvis's pool hall, gets into shape by swimming laps, and gets a pair of [[corrective lens]] sunglasses. On a winning streak, he enters the Atlantic City tournament and runs into Vincent and Carmen, overhearing them arrange a bet with another player. Eddie, winning against Julian; and Vincent, beating Grady, are set to face each other. Janelle arrives to support Eddie, who triumphs against Vincent. As Eddie and Janelle celebrate, Vincent and Carmen surprise Eddie with $8,000 \u2013 his \u201ccut\u201d of Vincent's winnings from intentionally losing their match.\n\nIn his semifinal match, Eddie sees his reflection in the two-ball; disgruntled, he forfeits the game and returns Vincent's money. With plans to live with Janelle, and determined to win legitimately, Eddie faces Vincent in a private match, declaring \"I'm back!\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Paul Newman]] as Eddie 'Fast Eddie' Felson\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as Vincent Lauria\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]] as Carmen\n* [[Helen Shaver]] as Janelle\n* [[John Turturro]] as Julian\n* [[Bill Cobbs]] as Orvis\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Amos\n* [[Keith McCready]] as Grady Seasons\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Tom Cruise by Gage Skidmore.jpg|upright|thumb|To perform his own pool shots, Tom Cruise practiced for hours on end.]]\n\n''The Color of Money'' was released by [[Touchstone Pictures]], after both [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Columbia Pictures]] declined.<ref name=GAN/> The film was shot over 49 days, with cinematographer [[Michael Ballhaus]] and a budget of $14.5 million.<ref name=GAN/> It is an adaptation of the [[The Color of Money (novel)|1984 novel of the same name]] by [[Walter Tevis]] and was written by [[Richard Price (writer)|Richard Price]].

In particular, he states that the extreme close ups of [[Tom Cruise]] around the pool table were inspired by those of the nuns in that film.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Lead star [[Paul Newman]] said that the best advice he was given by Scorsese was to \"try not to be funny.\" Cruise performed most of his own pool shots. An exception was a {{Cuegloss|Jump shot|jump shot}} over two balls to {{cuegloss|pot}} another. Scorsese believed Cruise could learn the shot, but that it would take too long, so the shot was performed for him by professional player [[Mike Sigel]]. Cruise mentioned that to prepare for the role, he bought a [[billiard table|pool table]] for his apartment and practiced for hours on end. Standing in for the extremely valuable \"Balabushka\" {{cuegloss|cue}} in the movie was actually a Joss J-18 (which later became the Joss 10-N7), made to resemble a classic Balabushka.<ref name=\"JossCue\" />\n\nSigel was a technical director, and he and fellow player [[Ewa Mataya Laurance]] served as technical consultants and shot performers on the film. Absent from the film is the character [[Minnesota Fats]], played by [[Jackie Gleason]] in ''The Hustler''.<ref name=GAN/> Newman later said that he had wanted the character to appear, but that none of the attempts to include him fit well into the story that was being written. According to Scorsese, Gleason apparently agreed with Newman's opinion that Minnesota Fats was not essential to the film's story. Scorsese said that Gleason was presented a draft of the script that had Fats worked into the narrative, but that upon reading it, Gleason declined to reprise the role because he felt that the character seemed to have been added as \"an afterthought.\"<ref name=\"Forsberg\" /><ref name=\"AJVqX\" />\n\n===Soundtrack===\nThe soundtrack to the motion picture was released by [[MCA Records]] in 1986.<ref name=\"XDjF5\" /> [[Robbie Robertson]] produced the score for the film.<ref name=\"8jzSv\" />\n\nTrack listing:\n{{Div col}}\n# \"Who Owns This Place?\" ([[Don Henley]]/[[Danny Kortchmar]]/[[J.D.
