Based on a true story, the film tells of a struggling British shoe factory's young, straight-laced owner, Charlie, who forms an unlikely partnership with Lola, a drag queen, to save the business. Charlie develops a plan to produce custom footwear for drag queens, rather than the men's dress shoes that his firm is known for, alienating many in the process.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Northampton]], in the [[East Midlands]] of [[England]], Charlie Price is attempting to save the family shoe factory, which has been floundering since his father died. While on a business trip to London to sell the company's extra stock, Charlie encounters a woman being harassed by drunken hoodlums and intervenes to his detriment. He wakes up backstage, in the dressing room of Lola, a [[drag queen]] performer and alter ego of Simon. Charlie is intrigued when he sees that drag queens' [[high heels]] snap easily, and wishes to create high heels that can support a greater range of foot sizes and body types. Back in Northampton, while in the process of laying off workers, one employee, Lauren, gives Charlie the idea of looking for a niche market product to save the business. Charlie then recruits Lauren to assist him in designing a high-heeled boot for drag performers.\n\nWhen their initial designs are met with scorn by Lola, Charlie and Lauren bring her on as a consultant. The road is initially bumpy: many of the male employees are uncomfortable with Lola's presence and the new direction, and Charlie's relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, Nicola, begins to deteriorate as she encourages him to sell the factory building to a developer. Although things improve when Lola tones down her personality and starts making friends, matters take a turn for the worse when Charlie is invited to showcase the new boots in [[Milan]]; the strain he puts on his employees causes most of them, including Lola, to walk out.\n\nCharlie's fianc\u00e9e arrives at the factory, furious that he took out a second mortgage on their house to save the company. Nicola insists that he sell the company, but Charlie is determined to save it and the jobs of his employees. The argument (which ends with Nicola leaving Charlie) is broadcast on the factory's PA system, which is overheard by Lauren and Lola's bitterest opponent at the factory, Don, a chauvinistic male worker. Don turns over a new leaf after Lola had graciously allowed him to win an arm wrestling match, and rallies the factory workers to make the boots in time for Charlie and Lauren to get to Milan. When Charlie catches Nicola with another man, he angrily takes out his frustrations on Lola, causing Lola to quit. After arriving in Milan with no one to model the boots, Charlie is forced to go onstage and model the boots himself. After he trips and ultimately falls flat on his face, Lola and her posse of drag queens arrive, put on a spectacular runway show, and save the day.\n\nIn the film's denouement, Lola headlines her own show and sings a song in honour of the \"kinky boots factory\" of Northampton. Most of the key workers are in attendance and enjoying themselves, including Charlie and Lauren, who have become a couple.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Joel Edgerton]] as Charlie Price\n**Sebastian Hurst-Palmer as Young Charlie Price\n* [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] as Lola/Simon\n** [[Courtney Phillips]] as Young Lola/Simon\n* [[Sarah-Jane Potts]] as Lauren\n* [[Jemima Rooper]] as Nicola Marsden\n* [[Nick Frost]] as Don Burton\n* [[Linda Bassett]] as Melanie\n* [[Robert Pugh]] as Harold Price\n* [[Ewan Hooper]] as George\n* [[Stephen Marcus]] as Big Mike\n* [[Mona Hammond]] as Pat\n* [[Kellie Bright]] as Jeannie\n* [[Joanna Scanlan]] as Trish\n* [[Geoffrey Streatfeild]] as Richard Bailey\n* [[Leo Bill]] as Harry Sampson\n}}\n\n==Background==\nAn episode of [[BBC2]] [[Television documentary|documentary series]] ''[[Trouble at the Top]]'', broadcast on 24 February 1999, inspired the film.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|last=Dowd |first=Vincent |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22940451 |title=BBC News - Kinky Boots inspiration comes out of the shadows |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-06-18 |access-date=2013-11-30}}</ref> The former featured Steve Pateman struggling with possible closure of W.J.
