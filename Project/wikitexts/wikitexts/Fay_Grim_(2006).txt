The film is a sequel to Hartley's 1997 film ''[[Henry Fool]]'', and revolves around the title character, played by [[Parker Posey]], the sister of Simon Grim ([[James Urbaniak]]).  The plot revolves around Fay's attempt to unravel an increasingly violent mystery in [[Europe]].<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/05/18/movies/18grim.html?_r=0 The New York Times]</ref><ref>[http://www.laweekly.com/2007-05-17/film-tv/film-reviews-delta-farce-hollywood-dreams-fay-grim-and-more/full/ LA Weekly]</ref><ref>[http://www.villagevoice.com/2007-05-08/film/additional-wilson-brother-found/ The Village Voice]</ref>\n\nHartley began writing the script in 2002, and filming took place in Europe from January to March 2006. It premiered in September at the [[2006 Toronto International Film Festival]], and received a theatrical release in the United States on May 18, 2007. The film was shot almost entirely in [[Dutch angle]]s, meaning the vast majority of shots are framed diagonally, or \"tilted\".  At the [[2007 Sundance Film Festival]], Hartley revealed that the two shots in the film's final cut that are not \"Dutched\" occurred when he and the film crew forgot to tilt the camera.\n\nA sequel, ''[[Ned Rifle]]'', was released in 2014.\n\n==Plot==\n\nSeven years after the events of ''[[Henry Fool]],'' Fay Grim ([[Parker Posey]]) is coerced by a [[CIA]] agent ([[Jeff Goldblum]]) to try to locate 'the confession novel' notebooks that belonged to her fugitive husband ([[Thomas Jay Ryan]]) whom he believes to be deceased. Fay is launched into a world of espionage as she travels to Paris to retrieve some of the journals, each having mysteriously appeared in the hands of the most unlikely of people. Simon Grim, Fay's brother and Nobel Prize\u2013winning poet because of Henry, remains home with his sister's son, the CIA and his publisher.\n\nEven in death it seems Henry is a force of nature causing life changing ructions in the lives of those he has touched. Fay is surrounded by competing agents all vying for her help in retrieving notebooks as she and Simon start getting clues to what the unpublishable nonsense of The Confession is really all about and why the CIA believe they contain information that could compromise U.S. security. A former air-hostess befriends Fay and reveals she was similarly touched by Henry's chaotic influence and aid her in her efforts.\n\nFay's whirlwind culminates in a tense meeting with a notorious terrorist and friend of Henry where she has to make the biggest decision of her life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col |colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Parker Posey]] as Fay Grim\n*[[James Urbaniak]] as Simon Grim\n*[[Liam Aiken]] as Ned Grim\n*[[Jeff Goldblum]] as Agent Fulbright\n*Megan Gay as Principal\n*[[Jasmin Tabatabai]] as Milla \n*Chuck Montgomery as Angus James\n*[[Leo Fitzpatrick]] as Carl Fogg\n*[[Saffron Burrows]] as Juliet\n*[[Elina L\u00f6wensohn]] as Bebe\n*[[Thomas Jay Ryan]] as Henry Fool\n*[[Anatole Taubman]] as Jallal\n*[[Nikolai Kinski]] as Amin\n*[[John Keogh]] as Prosecutor\n*[[Mehdi Nebbou]] as Islamic Cleric\n*[[Claudia Michelsen]] as Judge \n*[[David Scheller]] as Convict Husband\n*[[Sibel Kekilli]] as Concierge Istanbul Hotel\n*[[Peter Benedict]] as Raul Picard\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''Fay Grim'', like its predecessor ''[[Henry Fool]]'' (1997), was directed, written, co-produced and composed by [[Hal Hartley]].
