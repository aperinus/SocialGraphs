Based on a story by O'Bannon and [[Ronald Shusett]], it follows the crew of the commercial space tug ''Nostromo'',  who, after coming across a mysterious derelict spaceship on an undiscovered moon, find themselves up against [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|an aggressive and deadly extraterrestrial]] set loose on the ''Nostromo''. The film stars [[Tom Skerritt]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Veronica Cartwright]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]], [[John Hurt]], [[Ian Holm]], and [[Yaphet Kotto]]. It was produced by [[Gordon Carroll]], [[David Giler]], and [[Walter Hill (director)|Walter Hill]] through their company [[Brandywine Productions]], and was distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. Giler and Hill revised and made additions to the script; Shusett was the executive producer. The Alien and its accompanying artifacts were designed by the Swiss artist [[H. R. Giger]], while [[concept artist]]s [[Ron Cobb]] and [[Chris Foss]] designed the more human settings.\n\n''Alien'' premiered on May 25, 1979, as the opening night of the fourth Seattle International Film Festival, presented in 70&nbsp;mm at midnight.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historylink.org/File/10097|title=First Seattle International Film Festival (SIFF) opens at Moore Egyptian Theatre on May 14, 1976|first=John|last=Caldbick|date=May 1, 2012|work=HistoryLink.org|access-date=April 22, 2020|archive-date=July 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200725032101/https://www.historylink.org/File/10097|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.siff.net/festival/memory-the-origins-of-alien|title=Memory \u2014 The Origins of Alien|website=SIFF.net|access-date=April 22, 2020|archive-date=July 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200725024445/https://www.siff.net/festival/memory-the-origins-of-alien|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.liveabout.com/seattle-international-film-festival-siff-4782119|title=Seattle International Film Festival (SIFF): History and Winners|first=Christopher|last=McKittrick|website=LiveAbout.com|access-date=April 22, 2020|archive-date=July 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200702084457/https://www.liveabout.com/seattle-international-film-festival-siff-4782119|url-status=live}}</ref> It received a [[wide release]] on June 22 and was released on September 6 in the United Kingdom. It was met with mixed reviews on release but was a box-office success, winning the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]], three [[Saturn Award]]s ([[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]], [[Saturn Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]] for Scott, and [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Cartwright), and a [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]]. Critical reassessment since then has made ''Alien'' widely considered to be [[List of films considered the best|one of the greatest science fiction and horror films of all time]]. In 2002, ''Alien'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]]. In 2008, it was ranked by the [[American Film Institute]] as the seventh-best film in the science fiction genre, and as the 33rd-greatest film of all time by ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''.\n\nThe success of ''Alien'' spawned [[Alien (franchise)|a media franchise of films, novels, comic books, video games, and toys]]. It also launched Weaver's acting career, providing her with her first lead role. The story of [[Ellen Ripley|her character]]'s encounters with the alien creatures became the thematic and narrative core of the sequels ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986), ''[[Alien 3]]'' (1992), and ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' (1997). A crossover with the ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator]]'' franchise produced the ''[[Alien vs. Predator (franchise)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' films: ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' (2004) and ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'' (2007). A prequel series includes ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' (2012) and ''[[Alien: Covenant]]'' (2017), both directed by Scott.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- NOTE: The plot summary serves as an overview of the film's events. As per WP:FILMPLOT, the word count in a plot section should be 400-700 words. -->\nThe commercial space tug ''Nostromo'' is returning to Earth with a seven-member crew in [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]]: Captain Dallas, Executive Officer Kane, Warrant Officer Ripley, Navigator Lambert, Science Officer Ash, and engineers Parker and Brett. Detecting a transmission from a nearby moon, the ship's computer, Mother, awakens the crew. Per company policy requiring any potential distress signal be investigated, they land on the moon despite Parker's protests, sustaining damage from its atmosphere and rocky landscape. The engineers stay on board for repairs while Dallas, Kane, and Lambert investigate the terrain. They discover the signal originates from a derelict alien ship and enter it, losing contact with the ''Nostromo''. Ripley deciphers part of the transmission, determining it as a warning, but cannot relay the information to those on the derelict ship.\n\nMeanwhile, Kane discovers a chamber containing hundreds of large, egg-like objects. When he touches one, a creature springs out, penetrates his helmet, and attaches itself to his face. Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the ''Nostromo''. As the acting senior officer, Ripley refuses to let them aboard, citing quarantine regulations, but Ash overrides her decision and lets them inside. Ash attempts to remove the creature from Kane's face but stops when he discovers that its extremely corrosive acidic blood could hurt Kane and potentially damage the hull. It later freely detaches and is found dead. The ship is partially repaired, and the crew continues their journey back to Earth. Kane awakens with some memory loss but seems to be otherwise unharmed. During a final crew meal before returning to stasis, he suddenly chokes and convulses. A [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Chestburster|small alien creature]] bursts from Kane's chest, killing him, and escapes into the ship, with Ash dissuading the rest from killing it.\n\nAfter ejecting Kane's body out of an airlock, the crew attempts to locate the creature with tracking devices and capture it with nets, electric prods, and flamethrowers. Brett follows the crew's cat, Jones, into a landing leg compartment,<ref name=\"Ridley Scott interview\">{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Ridley |author-link=Ridley Scott |date=2005 |title=Ridley Scott: Interviews |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |page=23 |isbn=9781578067268 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JwDeB37eyI0C&pg=PA23 |access-date=May 17, 2020 |archive-date=July 25, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200725024605/https://books.google.com/books?id=JwDeB37eyI0C&pg=PA23 |url-status=live }}</ref> where the now-fully-grown alien attacks Brett and disappears with his body. After a heated discussion, the crew decides the creature must be in the air ducts. Dallas enters the ducts, intending to force the monster into an airlock, but it ambushes and [[Alien (film)#Post-production|seemingly]] kills him. Lambert, realizing that the alien intends to kill the crew one by one, implores the others to abandon ship and escape in its small shuttle, but Ripley, now in command, explains it will not support four people and insists on continuing Dallas' plan of flushing out the alien.\n\nAccessing Mother, Ripley discovers the company has secretly ordered Ash to return the alien, with the crew considered expendable. She confronts Ash, who tries to choke her to death. Parker intervenes and clubs Ash, knocking his head loose and revealing him as an [[android (robot)|android]]. He, Ripley, and Lambert reactivate Ash's head, and they learn that he was assigned to ensure the creature's survival. He expresses admiration for the creature's psychology, unhindered by conscience or morality, and taunts them about their chances of survival. Ripley cuts off his power and Parker incinerates him.\n\nThe remaining crew decides to self-destruct the ''Nostromo'' and escape in the shuttle. However, Parker and Lambert are ambushed and killed by the creature while gathering life-support supplies. Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence but finds the alien blocking her path to the shuttle. She retreats and attempts unsuccessfully to abort the self-destruct. With no further options, she flees to the shuttle, carrying Jones, and narrowly escapes as the ''Nostromo'' explodes.\n\nAs Ripley prepares for stasis, she discovers that the alien is aboard, having wedged itself into a narrow space. She dons a spacesuit and uses gas to flush the creature out. It approaches Ripley, but before it can attack, she opens an airlock door, almost blasting it into space. However, it hangs on by gripping the frame. Ripley shoots it with a grappling hook, but the gun catches as the airlock door closes, tethering the alien to the shuttle. It pulls itself into an engine exhaust, but Ripley fires the engines, blasting it away into deep space. After recording the final log entry, she places Jones and herself into stasis for the trip back to Earth.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Alien (1979) - main cast.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.25|alt=The seven principal cast members of the film stand in front of a white backdrop, in costume and holding prop weapons from the film.|The principal cast members of ''Alien'' (left to right: Holm, Stanton, Weaver, Kotto, Skerritt, Cartwright, and Hurt)]]\n{{see also|List of Alien (film series) characters}} \n* [[Tom Skerritt]] as Dallas, captain of the ''Nostromo''.

Scott described the set as the [[cockpit]] or driving deck of the mysterious ship, and the production team was able to convince the studio that the scene was important to impress the audience and make them aware that this was not a [[B movie]].<ref name=\"darkest reaches\" /><ref name=\"McIntee, 34\" /> To save money, only one wall of the set was created, and the \"space jockey\" sat atop a disc that could be rotated to facilitate shots from different angles in relation to the actors.<ref name=\"book of alien\" /><ref name=\"McIntee, 34\" /> Giger [[airbrush]]ed the entire set and the \"space jockey\" by hand.<ref name=\"darkest reaches\" /><ref name=\"McIntee, 34\" />\n\nThe origin of the jockey creature was not explored in the film, but Scott later theorized that it might have been the ship's pilot, and that the ship might have been a weapons-carrier capable of dropping alien eggs onto a planet so that the aliens could use the local lifeforms as hosts.<ref name=\"commentary\" /> In early versions of the script, the eggs were to be located in a separate [[pyramid]] structure, which would be found later by the ''Nostromo'' crew and would contain statues and [[hieroglyph]]s depicting the alien reproductive cycle, contrasting the human, alien, and space-jockey cultures.<ref name=\"McIntee, 21\" /> Cobb, Foss, and Giger each created concept artwork for these sequences, but they were eventually discarded due to budgetary concerns and the need to shorten the film.<ref name=\"book of alien\" /> Instead, the egg chamber was set inside the derelict ship and was filmed on the same set as the space-jockey scene; the entire disc piece supporting the jockey and its chair was removed and the set was redressed to create the egg chamber.<ref name=\"book of alien\" /> Light effects in the egg chamber were created by lasers borrowed from English rock band [[The Who]].

The final name of the ship was derived from the title of [[Joseph Conrad]]'s 1904 novel ''[[Nostromo]]'', while the escape shuttle, called ''Narcissus'' in the script, was named after Conrad's 1897 [[novella]] ''[[The Nigger of the 'Narcissus']]''.<ref name=\"McIntee, 15\" /> The production team particularly praised Cobb's ability to depict the interior settings of the ship in a realistic and believable manner. Under Scott's direction, the design of the ''Nostromo'' shifted towards an {{convert|800|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} tug towing a refining platform {{convert|2|mi|km}} long and {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} wide.<ref name=\"book of alien\" /> Cobb also created some conceptual drawings of the alien, but these were not used.<ref name=\"visualists\" /><ref name=\"McIntee, 28\" /> [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]] was attached to the project for a few days, as well, and his costume renderings served as the basis for the final space suits created by costume designer John Mollo.<ref name=\"book of alien\" /><ref name=\"McIntee, 28\" />\n\nThe spaceships and planets for the film were shot using models and miniatures. These included models of the ''Nostromo'', its attached mineral refinery, the escape shuttle ''Narcissus'', the alien planetoid, and the exterior and interior of the derelict spacecraft. Visual-effects supervisor Brian Johnson and supervising modelmaker [[Martin Bower]] and their team worked at Bray Studios, roughly {{convert|25|mi}} from Shepperton Studios.<ref name=\"outward bound\">\"Outward Bound: Visual Effects\", ''The Beast Within: The Making of Alien''.</ref><ref name=\"McIntee, 36\">McIntee, 36</ref> The designs of the ''Nostromo'' and its attachments were based on combinations of Scott's storyboards and Ron Cobb's conceptual drawings.<ref name=\"outward bound\" /> The basic outlines of the models were made of wood and plastic, and most of the fine details were added from [[scale model|model kits]] of warships, tanks, and World War II bombers.\n\nThree models of the ''Nostromo'' were made: a {{convert|12|in|cm|adj=on}} version for medium and long shots, a {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=on}} version for rear shots, and a {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}}, {{convert|7|ST|t|adj=on}} rig for the undocking and planetoid surface sequences.<ref name=\"book of alien\" /><ref name=\"McIntee, 36\" /> Scott insisted on numerous changes to the models even as filming was taking place, leading to conflicts with the modeling and filming teams. The ''Nostromo'' was originally yellow, and the team filmed shots of the models for six weeks before Johnson left to work on ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. Scott then ordered it changed to gray, and the team had to begin shooting again from scratch.<ref name=\"outward bound\" /><ref name=\"McIntee, 36\" /> He asked that more and more pieces be added to the model such that the final version (with the refinery) required a metal framework so that it could be hoisted by a [[forklift]]. He also took a hammer and chisel to sections of the refinery, knocking off many of the spires that Bower had spent weeks creating. Scott also had disagreements with miniature-effects cinematographer [[Dennis Ayling]] over how to light the models.<ref name=\"outward bound\" />\n\nA separate model, about {{convert|40|ft|m}} long, was created for the ''Nostromo''{{'s}} underside from which the ''Narcissus'' would detach and from which Kane's body would be launched during the funeral scene. Bower carved Kane's burial [[shroud]] out of wood; it was launched through the hatch using a small [[catapult]] and filmed at high speed. The footage was slowed down in editing.<ref name=\"outward bound\" /><ref name=\"McIntee, 37\">McIntee, 37.</ref> Only one shot was filmed using [[chroma key|blue-screen]] compositing - that of the shuttle racing past the ''Nostromo''. The other shots were simply filmed against black backdrops, with stars added by [[multiple exposure|double exposure]].<ref name=\"McIntee, 36\" /> Though [[motion control photography]] technology was available at the time, the film's budget would not allow for it. The team, therefore, used a camera with wide-angle lenses mounted on a drive mechanism to make slow passes over and around the models filming at {{frac|2|1|2}} frames per second,<ref name=\"book of alien\" /> giving them the appearance of motion. Scott added smoke and wind effects to enhance the illusion.<ref name=\"outward bound\" /> For the scene in which the ''Nostromo'' detaches from the refinery, a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} docking arm was created using pieces from model railway kits. The ''Nostromo'' was pushed away from the refinery by a forklift covered in black velvet, causing the arm to extend out from the refinery. This created the illusion that the arm was pushing the ship forward.<ref name=\"outward bound\" /><ref name=\"McIntee, 36\" /> Shots of the ship's exterior in which characters are seen moving around inside were filmed using larger models which contained projection screens displaying pre-recorded footage.<ref name=\"outward bound\" />\n\nA separate model was created for the exterior of the derelict alien spacecraft. [[Matte (filmmaking)|Matte paintings]] were used to fill in areas of the ship's interior, as well as exterior shots of the planetoid's surface.<ref name=\"outward bound\" /> The surface as seen from space during the landing sequence was created by painting a [[globe]] white, then mixing chemicals and dyes onto [[transparency (projection)|transparencies]] and projecting them onto it.<ref name=\"book of alien\" /><ref name=\"McIntee, 36\" /> The planetoid was not named in the film, but some drafts of the script gave it the name [[Acheron]]<ref name=\"McIntee, 30\" /> after the river which in [[Greek mythology]] is described as the \"stream of woe\"; it is a branch of the river [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]], and forms the border of [[Hell]] in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''.

The film is often cited as a major work of [[abjection]], as outlined by Julia Kristeva in her 1980 work ''[[Powers of Horror]]''. According to Kristeva, the abject refers to that which signifies the breakdown of conventional borders and rules. It confronts the subject with the fallibility of the human body and societal norms, and thus exposes how the supposedly sacred distinctions between what is Self and what is Other are arbitrary.<ref>Kristeva, Julia. [Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection]</ref> She suggests that this confrontation\u2014often manifesting in excrement, bodily invasion and corpses\u2014is an inherently traumatic interruption of subjectivity, and thus all evidence of abjection is hidden in conventional society. Much of ''Alien''{{'s}} effectiveness as a work of horror has been attributed to its indulgence in abject themes and imagery, and has thus functioned as a major framework for critics, such as Barbara Creed, in their analysis of the film. Following Creed's assertion that the alien creature is a representation of the \"monstrous-feminine as [[archaic mother]]\",<ref>Creed, Barbara. \"Alien and The Monstrous-Feminine.\" ''Alien Zone: Cultural Theory and Contemporary Science Fiction Cinema''.

Roger Ebert ranked it among \"the most influential of modern action pictures\" and praised its pacing, atmosphere, and settings:\n{{blockquote|\nOne of the great strengths of ''Alien'' is its pacing. It takes its time. It waits. It allows silences (the majestic opening shots are underscored by Jerry Goldsmith with scarcely audible, far-off metallic chatterings). It suggests the enormity of the crew's discovery by building up to it with small steps: The interception of a signal (is it a warning or an [[SOS]]?). The descent to the extraterrestrial surface. The bitching by Brett and Parker, who are concerned only about collecting their shares. The masterstroke of the surface murk through which the crew members move, their helmet lights hardly penetrating the soup. The shadowy outline of the alien ship. The sight of the alien pilot, frozen in his command chair. The enormity of the discovery inside the ship (\"It's full of ... leathery eggs ...\").<ref name=\"ebert 2003 review\" />\n}}\n[[David A. McIntee]] praises ''Alien'' as \"possibly the definitive combination of horror thriller with science fiction trappings.\"<ref name=\"McIntee, 41\" /> He notes that it is a horror film first and a science fiction film second, since science fiction normally explores issues of how humanity will develop under other circumstances. ''Alien'', on the other hand, focuses on the plight of people being attacked by a monster: \"It's set on a spaceship in the future, but it's about people trying not to get eaten by a drooling monstrous animal. Worse, it's about them trying not to get raped by said drooling monstrous animal.\"<ref name=\"McIntee, 41\" /> Along with ''Halloween'' and ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980), he describes it as a prototype for the [[slasher film]] genre: \"The reason it's such a good movie, and wowed both the critics, who normally frown on the genre, and the casual cinema-goer, is that it is a distillation of everything that scares us in the movies.\"<ref name=\"McIntee, 41\" /> He also describes how the film appeals to a variety of audiences: \"Fans of [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcockian]] thrillers like it because it's moody and dark. Gorehounds like it for the chest-burster. Science fiction fans love the [[hard science fiction]] trappings and hardware.
