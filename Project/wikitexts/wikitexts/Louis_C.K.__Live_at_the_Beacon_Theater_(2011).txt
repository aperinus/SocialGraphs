Instead, C.K. included a letter emphasizing the direct relationship between the artist and consumer in the hopes that this would more effectively deter piracy.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to objectively draw conclusions about the model's viability and impact, the comedian himself considered the experiment a success. According to a statement issued three days after the film's release, he claimed to have covered the $250,000 costs of the film and website within 12 hours of its release, and that he had grossed $550,000 as of the time of the statement's writing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://buy.louisck.net/statement|title=Another Statement From Louis C.K.|author=C.K., Louis|date=2011-12-21|accessdate=2011-12-12}}</ref> Although the film was made available by pirates shortly after release, C.K. believes that the rate of piracy was low due to the low cost of the product, convenient delivery, and the lack of a middle man profiting from its sales.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/tech-news/why-louis-cks-big-payday-proves-the-internet-has-ethics/article2272517/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | first=Chris | last=Hannay | title=Why Louis C.K.'s big payday proves the Internet has ethics - The Globe and Mail | date=2011-12-15}}</ref> In an interview with [[Bill Simmons]] two days later, he said that his gross had increased to $800,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espnradio/play?id=7355735 |title=The B.S.
