After Coral and nearly all the eggs are eaten by a [[barracuda]], Marlin becomes overprotective of his son Nemo, born of one remaining egg. While Marlin talks to Nemo's teacher on the latter's first day of school, Nemo approaches a speedboat, where a pair of scuba divers capture him. Marlin pursues the boat in vain and meets Dory, a [[Paracanthurus|blue tang]] with [[anterograde amnesia|acute short-term memory loss]], who offers her help. The two encounter Bruce, Anchor, and Chum, three sharks who have sworn to abstain from eating fish. Marlin finds a diver's mask that fell from the boat, accidentally hitting Dory and giving her a nosebleed. The scent of her blood sends Bruce into a feeding frenzy, but the sharks flee after accidentally setting off old [[naval mines]], which knock Marlin and Dory unconscious.\n\nNemo is placed in an aquarium in the office of dentist Philip Sherman in [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]]. He meets the \"Tank Gang\" led by Gill, a [[Moorish idol]]. The Tank Gang tell Nemo that he is to be given to Sherman's niece Darla, who killed her previous fish. Gill decides to help Nemo and devises an escape plan: Nemo can fit inside the aquarium's filter tube and must block it with a pebble, obliging Sherman to put the fish into plastic bags while he cleans the tank, and allow them to roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to place the pebble, but fails and is almost killed.\n\nMarlin and Dory awaken, but the mask falls into a deep trench. Descending after mask, they are soon pursued by an [[anglerfish]]. Dory memorizes the address on the goggles and they escape. The two disregard directions from a school of [[Monodactylidae|moonfish]], taking what Marlin believes is a safer route. After being stung by a forest of [[jellyfish]], they are knocked unconscious and awaken in the [[East Australian Current]] with a group of [[sea turtles]], including Crush and his son, Squirt. The story of Marlin's quest is relayed across the ocean to Sydney, where a [[pelican]] named Nigel tells the Tank Gang. Nemo then succeeds in blocking the filter and soon the aquarium is covered in [[green algae]].\n\nMarlin and Dory exit the East Australian Current and are consumed by a [[blue whale]] which expels them through its [[Blowhole (anatomy)|blowhole]] in [[Sydney Harbour]]. Nigel helps them escape a flock of [[Gull|seagulls]] and takes them to the dentist's office. Sherman has foiled the Tank Gang with a new high-tech filter. When Darla arrives, Nemo plays dead and Nigel terrifies Darla, throwing the office into chaos. Sherman throws out Nigel along with Marlin and Dory, with the former believing that Nemo is dead. Gill helps Nemo escape through a drain leading to the ocean.\n\nMarlin bids farewell to Nigel and Dory and begins his journey home. Nemo meets Dory but she does not remember him until her memory returns when she reads the word \"Sydney\" on a drainpipe. Dory reunites Nemo with Marlin, but a [[fishing trawler]] captures her in a [[Fishing net|net]] along with a school of [[grouper]]s. With his father's blessing, Nemo enters the net, and he and Marlin instruct all of the fish to swim down. Their combined force breaks the net. Returning home to the reef, Marlin is more confident, while Dory has remained friends with Bruce, Anchor, and Chum. Marlin and Dory watch Nemo off as he goes to school.\n\n==Voice cast{{anchor|Cast}}==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2016}}<!-- All species need to be sourced -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Marlin, a cynical [[clownfish]] and Nemo's overprotective father.\n* [[Ellen DeGeneres]] as Dory, a [[regal blue tang]] with [[amnesia|short-term memory loss]].\n* [[Alexander Gould]] as Nemo, Marlin's only surviving son, who is excited about life and exploring the ocean, but gets captured and domesticated as a pet.\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as Gill, a [[scar]]red [[moorish idol]] fish living in an aquarium in Philip Sherman's dentistry clinic, and the leader of the Tank Gang.\n* [[Brad Garrett]] as Bloat, the aquarium's [[porcupinefish]].\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Peach, the aquarium's [[sea star]].\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Bubbles, the aquarium's [[yellow tang]] fish.\n* [[Austin Pendleton]] as Gurgle, the aquarium's [[obsessive-compulsive]] [[royal gramma]] fish.\n* [[Vicki Lewis]] as Deb and Flo, the aquarium's [[Dascyllus melanurus|striped damselfish]].\n* [[Joe Ranft]] as Jacques, the aquarium's [[cleaner shrimp]].\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as Nigel, an [[Australian pelican]], who often visits the dentist clinic and is friends with the aquarium fish.\n* [[Andrew Stanton]] as Crush, a [[green sea turtle]].\n* [[Elizabeth Perkins]] as Coral, Marlin's wife and Nemo's mother.\n* [[Nicholas Bird]] as Squirt, Crush's son.\n* [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]] as Mr. Ray, a [[spotted eagle ray]] and Nemo's schoolteacher.\n* [[Barry Humphries]] as Bruce, a vegetarian [[great white shark]], who fights his instinctive will to eat innocent fish and is friends with Anchor and Chum.\n* [[Eric Bana]] as Anchor, a [[hammerhead shark]] who is friends with Bruce and Chum.\n* [[Bruce Spence]] as Chum, a [[mako shark]] who is friends with Bruce and Anchor.\n* [[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]] as Philip Sherman, a dentist who keeps Nemo and the Tank Gang in an aquarium.\n* LuLu Ebeling as Darla, Sherman's rambunctious young niece.\n* Jordy Ranft as Tad, a [[butterfly fish]] fingerling and Nemo's school friend.\n* Erica Beck as Pearl, a young [[flapjack octopus]] and Nemo's school friend.\n* [[Erik Per Sullivan]] as Sheldon, a young [[seahorse]], and Nemo's school friend.\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as the school of [[Silver moony|moonfish]].\n}}\n<ref name=\"Finding Nemo on Pixar.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pixar.com/feature-films/finding-nemo |publisher=Pixar |access-date=13 July 2021 |at=Cast|title=Pixar Animation Studios}} The Pixar webpage for Finding Nemo displays the full cast list and serves as a reference for the entire section.</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Andrew Stanton cropped 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Andrew Stanton]] wrote and directed the film.]]\nThe inspiration for ''Finding Nemo'' sprang from multiple experiences, going back to director [[Andrew Stanton]]'s childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home.<ref name=\"commentary\">{{cite AV media |people=Andrew Stanton, Lee Unkrich, and Bob Peterson |title=Finding Nemo \u2014 Audio Commentary |medium=DVD |year=2004 |publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment}}</ref> In 1992, shortly after his son was born, he and his family took a trip to [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]] (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation.<ref>{{cite AV media |title=[[The Pixar Story]] |people=[[Leslie Iwerks|Iwerks, Leslie]] (director) |year=2007 |type=Documentary film |publisher=[[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures Distribution]]}}</ref> Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\nIn an interview with ''[[National Geographic]]'' magazine, Stanton said that the idea for the characters of Marlin and Nemo came from a photograph of two clownfish peeking out of an [[Sea anemone|anemone]]:\n\n{{blockquote|It was so arresting. I had no idea what kind of fish they were, but I couldn't take my eyes off them. And as an entertainer, the fact that they were called clownfish\u2014it was perfect. There's almost nothing more appealing than these little fish that want to play peekaboo with you.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Prosek |first=James |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2010/01/clownfish-anemone-symbiotic-relationship/ |title=Beautiful Friendship |magazine=[[National Geographic]] |date=January 2010 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n}}\n\nIn addition, clownfish are colorful, but do not tend to come out of an anemone often. For a character who has to go on a dangerous journey, Stanton felt a clownfish was the perfect type of fish for the character.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Pre-production of the film began in early 1997. Stanton began writing the screenplay during the post-production of ''[[A Bug's Life]]''. As a result, ''Finding Nemo'' began production with a complete screenplay, something that co-director [[Lee Unkrich]] called \"very unusual for an animated film\".<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The artists took [[scuba diving]] lessons to study the coral reef.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\nStanton originally planned to use flashbacks to reveal how Coral died but realized that by the end of the film there would be nothing to reveal, deciding to show how she died at the beginning of the movie.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The character of Gill also was different from the character seen in the final film. In a scene that was eventually deleted, Gill tells Nemo that he's from a place called Bad Luck Bay and that he has brothers and sisters in order to impress the young clownfish, only for the latter to find out that he was lying by listening to a patient reading a children's storybook that shares exactly the same details.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n===Casting===\n[[William H. Macy]] was the first actor cast as Marlin. Although Macy had recorded most of the dialogue, Stanton felt that the character needed a lighter touch.<ref>{{cite book |last=Price |first=David A. |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780307265753 |title=The Pixar Touch: The Making of a Company |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780307265753/page/210/mode/1up 210] |year=2008 |publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]] |location=New York |url-access=registration |isbn=978-0-307-26575-3}}</ref> Stanton then cast [[Albert Brooks]] in the role, and in his opinion, it \"saved\" the film.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Brooks liked the idea of Marlin being this clownfish who isn't funny and recorded outtakes of telling very bad jokes.\n\nThe idea for the initiation sequence came from a story conference between Stanton and [[Bob Peterson (animator)|Bob Peterson]] while they were driving to record the actors. Although he originally envisioned the character of Dory as male, Stanton was inspired to cast [[Ellen DeGeneres]] when he watched an episode of ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' in which he saw her \"change the subject five times before finishing one sentence\".<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The pelican character named Gerald (who in the final film ends up swallowing and choking on Marlin and Dory) was originally a friend of Nigel. They were going to play against each other with Nigel being neat and [[wikt:fastidious|fastidious]] and Gerald being scruffy and sloppy. The filmmakers could not find an appropriate scene for them that did not slow the pace of the picture, so Gerald's character was minimized.<ref name=\"commentary\" />\n\nStanton himself provided the voice of Crush the sea turtle. He originally did the voice for the film's [[Storyboard|story reel]] and assumed they would find an actor later. When Stanton's performance became popular in test screenings, he decided to keep his performance in the film. He recorded all his dialogue while lying on a sofa in Unkrich's office.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Crush's son Squirt was voiced by Nicholas Bird, the young son of fellow Pixar director [[Brad Bird]]. According to Stanton, the elder Bird was playing a tape recording of his young son around the Pixar studios one day. Stanton felt the voice was \"this generation's [[Thumper (Disney)|Thumper]]\" and immediately cast Nicholas.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n[[Megan Mullally]] was originally going to provide a voice in the film. According to Mullally, the producers were stunned to learn that the voice of her character [[Karen Walker (Will & Grace)|Karen Walker]] on the television show ''[[Will & Grace]]'' was not her natural speaking voice. The producers hired her anyway, and then strongly encouraged her to use her Karen Walker voice for the role. When Mullally refused, she was dismissed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.contactmusic.com/megan-mullally/news/megan-mullally-dropped-from-finding-nemo|title=Megan Mullally&nbsp;\u2013 Megan Mullally Dropped From Finding Nemo|website=[[Contactmusic.com]]|date=April 6, 2004|access-date=October 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Animation===\nTo ensure that the movements of the fish in the film were believable, the animators took a crash course in fish biology and oceanography.

Before May 26, 2003, stickers on over 50 million bags of potato chips alerted consumers to a sweepstakes dangling a trip for four to [[Sydney, Australia]] with a visit to the [[Great Barrier Reef]]. On May 17, 2003, Frito-Lay hosted an event at each of the [[Walmart]] stores, where kids could use 3D goggles to find hidden images of Nemo. Kellogg's packed eight different water toys depicting film characters inside [[Frosted Flakes]], [[Rice Krispies]], [[Honey Smacks]] and Cocoa Rice Krispies cereal boxes. The Honey Smacks, Frosted Flakes, [[Crispix|Cinnamon Crunch Crispix]] and [[Froot Loops]] boxes also carried a Nemo memory card game on back panels. Plus, a Nemo-themed Marshmallow Froot Loops cereal featured four of the film's characters. Consumers could mail in two UPCs from the three Kellogg's cereals to receive a large beach towel. Besides this, the company unveiled a new type of [[Pop-Tarts]] inspired by ''Finding Nemo''. Known as the Great Berry Reef Pop-Tarts, they had a wild berry filling and fish sprinkles. A pool raft was available with two Pop-Tart UPCs and shipping, handled by [[FCB (advertising agency)|Draft Worldwide]] of [[Chicago]]. [[Eggo]] waffles would offer holographic swimming goggles with the purchase of two of its products with shipping and handling. For their snacks division, Kellogg's offered consumers who purchased two packages of select products and two gallons of milk with a giant inflatable shark. The company advertised the film on Vanilla Wafers, [[Chips Deluxe]], Mini Fudge Shoppe Fudge Stripes, Soft Batch Chocolate Chip Cookies, [[Rice Krispies Treats]] and limited edition Nemo-themed cookies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chiefmarketer.com/frito-lay-kellogg-and-others-gear-up-for-nemo/|title=FRITO-LAY, KELLOGG AND OTHERS GEAR UP FOR 'NEMO'}}</ref>\n\nOn May 20, 2003, Kellogg's recalled Frosted Flakes cereal boxes due to their extremely close resemblance of a Hasbro memory card game. A lawsuit was filed against the company, which included a full-page reproduction of the front of a Frosted Flakes box with the cereal's familiar [[Tony the Tiger]] mascot grinning next to Nemo, Dory & Crush from the film.
