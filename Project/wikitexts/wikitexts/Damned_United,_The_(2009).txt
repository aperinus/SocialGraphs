Produced by [[BBC Films]] and [[Left Bank Pictures]] with additional funding from [[Regional screen agencies|Screen Yorkshire]] and [[Columbia Pictures]], [[Sony Pictures Releasing|Sony Pictures Releasing International]] served as distributor.\n\nOriginally proposed by [[Stephen Frears]], he pulled out of the project in November 2007, and Hooper took over. Filming took place from May to July 2008. Marking the fifth collaboration between screenwriter [[Peter Morgan]] and actor [[Michael Sheen]], who plays Clough, the film was released in the United Kingdom on 27 March 2009 and in North America on 25 September. It was a [[box office bomb]], grossing $4.1 million worldwide against a $10 million production budget.\n\nDespite controversy due to the film's numerous historical inaccuracies, ''The Damned United'' received critical acclaim upon release, with particular praise given for Sheen's performance. It received numerous award nominations including the [[British Independent Film Award]] for Best Supporting Actor, the [[ALFS Award]] for British Supporting Actor of the Year, the [[Satellite Award]] for Best Actor in a Motion Picture, Drama and Best Actor in a Supporting Role and the Writers' Guild of Great Britain Award for Best Feature Film Screenplay.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter failing to qualify for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]], England manager [[Alf Ramsey]] is replaced by [[Don Revie]] ([[Colm Meaney]]), the highly successful manager of [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]]. Revie's replacement at Leeds is [[Brian Clough]] ([[Michael Sheen]]), the former manager of [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and a fierce critic of Leeds because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie's management. Furthermore, Clough's long-time assistant, [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1928)|Peter Taylor]] ([[Timothy Spall]]), has not joined him.\n\nThe roots of Clough's conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a [[1967\u201368 FA Cup|1968 FA Cup]] match between Leeds, the leaders of the [[1967\u201368 Football League|First Division]]<ref>Though Leeds were leading the table, they did not win the league that season, eventually finishing fourth. The eventual winners were [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]</ref> and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough assumed Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of [[Middlesbrough]] and both played for [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], and made many preparations for the match. However, on the day of the match, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the [[Baseball Ground]]. Derby eventually lost 2&ndash;0.<ref>Although Leeds did beat Derby 2&ndash;0 in the [[FA Cup]] that season, in reality the game was played at United's [[Elland Road]] ground. It was the second of three games between the two sides that season, the FA Cup tie being sandwiched between the two legs of a [[Football League Cup]] semi-final.</ref> Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran [[Dave Mackay]] ([[Brian McCardie]]), along with several other young players. Chairman [[Sam Longson]] ([[Jim Broadbent]]) is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted, but in their first league game against Leeds they lose 5&ndash;0. The club win their first ever [[1971\u201372 Football League|League championship]] in 1972, meaning a [[European Cup]] campaign the following year. They go through to the [[1972\u201373 European Cup#Semi-finals|semi-finals]] against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. Unfortunately, against Longson's advice, Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final, against Leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie. They suffer injuries and [[Billy Bremner]] ([[Stephen Graham]]) sarcastically wishes Clough well for the semi-final. Juventus defeat them 3-1, and Clough publicly lambasts Longson.<ref>In fact, the match between Derby and Leeds took place before Derby's ''quarter-final'' match, which they won despite their injury list. Their eventual defeat by Juventus was with a nearly full-strength squad, and Clough blamed Juventus's gamesmanship, rather than Sam Longson, for Derby's exit.</ref>\n\nTaylor then suffers a heart attack, and Clough tries to secure his position by offering his and Taylor's resignations in a protest against the chairman's unwillingness to fund further signings. He is outraged when the directors accept their resignations and ban them from entering the Baseball Ground again (although Clough later sneaks in as a supporter). Derby fans' protests raise Clough's hopes of being reinstated, and he is backed by the majority of his players as well, but former player Dave Mackay is appointed manager instead. Derby fans quickly lose interest and Clough loses all hope of getting his job back. He and Taylor are then offered jobs at [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]]. They agree to take the jobs after taking an all-expenses-paid holiday in [[Majorca]]. During the holiday that summer, Clough agrees to take control of Leeds after being approached by their representative.<ref>The film shows him effectively reneging on his deal to take over at Brighton, although in reality he had nine relatively unsuccessful months as manager there.</ref> Taylor, however, argues the case for staying at Brighton, and after a bitter quarrel, the two go their separate ways.\n\nBack in the storyline's \"present\u201d: Clough alienates his players in their first training session, first by accusing them of winning all of their awards by cheating, and then making them start with a 7-a-side game as if they were schoolchildren. When Bremner protests that Revie never made them do this, Clough reminds them that he is not Revie and threatens a severe punishment for any player who mentions the former manager's name or methods again.\n\nThe season starts with a [[1974 FA Charity Shield|Charity Shield]] match against FA Cup winners [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at Wembley, which is widely anticipated as both the final match of Liverpool manager [[Bill Shankly]] and Clough's debut as Leeds manager. Unfortunately, the event is marred when the Leeds captain Billy Bremner gets into a fight with [[Kevin Keegan]]. Both are sent off, and in turn throw their shirts off and walk off the pitch bare-chested in defiance. Leeds lose the match, and Bremner is given a two-month suspension from football, forcing Leeds to start the season without their influential captain. As a result, Leeds suffer a horrendous start to the [[1974\u201375 Football League|season]] and are in danger of relegation only one season after winning the title. After Bremner and the players air their grievances to the board, the club terminates Clough's contract after just 44 days - though he forces them to pay an enormous severance package. Afterwards, Clough agrees to do a final interview with [[Yorkshire Television]], but finds Revie there to confront him, bringing the two face-to-face at last. Clough accuses Revie of being 'cold-hearted' and 'fundamentally dishonest', both as a person and a football manager, and Revie in turn brands Clough as 'inflexible and egocentric'. Clough brings up the incident in the 1968 FA Cup, and Revie claims to have not known who the rookie manager was at the time (a doubtful claim considering that Revie was known for meticulously researching every opponent his team faced). After the interview, Clough drives down to [[Brighton]] to patch things up with Taylor. It involves Clough literally getting on his knees, grovelling at Taylor's dictation, and they are reconciled.\n\nIn the film's epilogue, the audience is told that Don Revie \"failed as England manager\", and afterwards never worked in football in his home country again, spending the rest of his career working in the [[Middle East]], where he was accused of financial mismanagement. Brian Clough and Peter Taylor, meanwhile, reunited at the \"small, provincial club\" [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], where they repeated their prior achievements with Derby by helping them win promotion to the First Division and then winning the title. They went on to better both Revie and their own spell at Derby by winning two European Cups in succession, in 1979 and 1980. The film ends with the caption: \"Brian Clough remains the greatest manager the England team never had.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Michael Sheen]] as [[Brian Clough]]\n*[[Timothy Spall]] as [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)|Peter Taylor]]\n*[[Colm Meaney]] as [[Don Revie]]\n*[[Jim Broadbent]] as Sam Longson\n*Andy Graham as [[Terry Cooper (footballer, born 1944)|Terry Cooper]]\n*[[Maurice Ro\u00ebves]] as [[Jimmy Gordon (footballer, born 1915)|Jimmy Gordon]]\n*[[Elizabeth Carling]] as Barbara Clough\n*[[Oliver Stokes]] as [[Nigel Clough]]\n*Ryan Day as Simon Clough\n*Peter Quinn as [[Bob Matthewson]]\n*[[Henry Goodman]] as [[Manny Cussins]]\n*Jimmy Reddington as Keith Archer\n*Liam Thomas as Les Cocker\n*Danny Tomlinson as [[David Harvey (footballer)|David Harvey]]\n*Lesley Maylett as [[Paul Reaney]]\n*Chris Moore as [[Paul Madeley]]\n*John Savage as [[Gordon McQueen]]\n*Mark Cameron as [[Norman Hunter (footballer)|Norman Hunter]]\n*Tom Ramsbottom as [[Trevor Cherry]]\n*Matthew Storton as [[Peter Lorimer]]\n*[[Peter McDonald (actor)|Peter McDonald]] as [[Johnny Giles]]\n*[[Stephen Graham]] as [[Billy Bremner]]\n*Bill Bradshaw as [[Terry Yorath]]\n*Stuart Gray as [[Eddie Gray (footballer, born 1948)|Eddie Gray]]\n*Alex Harker as [[Allan Clarke (footballer)|Allan Clarke]]\n*Craig Williams as [[Joe Jordan]]\n*[[Joe Dempsie]] as [[Duncan McKenzie]]\n*[[Brian McCardie]] as [[Dave Mackay]]\n*[[Martin Compston]] as [[John O'Hare]]\n*Colin Harris as [[John McGovern (footballer)|John McGovern]]\n*Giles Alderson as [[Colin Todd]]\n*Stewart Robertson as [[Archie Gemmill]]\n*Laurie Rea as [[Terry Hennessey]]\n*Tomasz Kocinski as [[Roy McFarland]]\n*Mark Bazeley as [[Austin Mitchell]]\n*Elliot Stroud as solicitor \n*Mark Jameson as head groundsman\n*David Stevenson as reporter\n*[[Nathan Head]] as reporter\n*Chris Wilson as FA disciplinary committee chairman\n*[[Ralph Ineson]] as a crazy wild-haired reporter\n*William Martyn Conboy as Key reporter, Revie departure scene\n*[[John Craven]] as himself\n*[[Tony Gubba]] as himself\n*[[Jimmy Hill]] as himself\n*[[Paul Bown]]'' as Mike Bamber\n*[[Barry Davies]] as himself (uncredited)\n*[[David Coleman]] as himself (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn 2006, [[Stephen Frears]] read ''[[The Damned Utd]]'' while travelling to the [[Venice Film Festival]].

However, O'Hare was signed almost a year before Mackay, and McGovern and Mackay were signed on different days. Murphy also declared that the insinuation of Clough not wanting to debate with Revie about his tenure at Leeds United is completely inaccurate.<ref name=\"guardian1\"/>\n\nMurphy was also angered by the portrayal of Clough's drinking and smoking. He insisted that throughout the 1970s Clough was a perfectly fit manager who often actively trained with players at training ground matches, and that the portrayal of him drinking and smoking heavily was a battle he faced approximately 10\u201320 years after he became manager of Nottingham Forest in 1975.<ref name=\"guardian1\"/>\n\nIn the film, Clough is seen preparing Derby's [[Baseball Ground|Baseball Ground stadium]] ahead of the 1968 [[FA Cup]] tie against [[Leeds United]] and Revie blanking him on the way into the ground.

Taylor and Clough are also seen to argue fiercely in Majorca over the Leeds' manager's job offer. There is no record of Clough arguing with Taylor over joining him at Leeds nor a lack of interest in Brighton.\n\nThe film says that Leeds lost 1\u20130 to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] during Clough's reign; this game, played on 7 September 1974, in fact finished 1\u20131 with [[Barry Butlin]] equalising for Luton after Leeds took the lead through Allan Clarke.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wafll.com/leeds-statistics/leeds-1974-75.html |title=Leeds United 1973-74 - Leeds United Season Stats 1974-75 - Leeds United 1975-76|publisher=wafll.com |access-date=27 January 2020}}</ref> \n\t\nThe film shows Clough standing outside an entrance to Derby County's Baseball Ground featuring the stylised ram emblem, in 1968; in reality, the latter was not designed until 1971.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/derby/content/articles/2007/06/07/rams_crest_new_2007_feature.shtml|title=New Rams crest revealed|publisher=BBC |access-date=27 January 2020}}</ref> \n\t\nThe film implies that Derby's 5\u20130 defeat to Leeds occurred in the 1969\u201370 season, soon after their promotion to the first division, with [[Gordon McQueen]] playing for [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] against in the match.

However, Taylor managed Brighton & Hove Albion by himself for the 1974/75 and 1975/76 seasons, with Clough joining Nottingham Forest in Jan 1975 where he managed by himself up to the end of 1975/76. Taylor then re-united with Clough professionally in July 1976 at Forest, with the pair winning promotion in 1976/77.\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Award\n! Category\n!
