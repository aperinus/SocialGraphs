The screenplay was written by [[Tim Herlihy]] and Timothy Dowling from a screen story by Herlihy. The film co-stars [[Kevin James]], [[Michelle Monaghan]], [[Peter Dinklage]], [[Josh Gad]] and [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]. Combining [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] video game characters and [[visual effects]], the film follows an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien race]] misinterpreting [[video feed]]s of [[Golden age of arcade video games|classic arcade games]] as a declaration of war, resulting in them invading Earth using technology inspired by 1980s games such as ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Space Invaders]]'', ''[[Arkanoid]]'', ''[[Galaga]]'', ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''. To counter the invasion, the United States hires former [[Esports|arcade champions]] to lead the planet's defense. [[Principal photography]] on the film began on May 28, 2014, in [[Toronto]]; filming was completed in three months.\n\nProduced by Columbus's [[1492 Pictures]] and Sandler's [[Happy Madison Productions]], ''Pixels'' was released theatrically by [[Columbia Pictures]] (via [[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group#Sony Pictures Releasing|Sony Pictures Releasing]]) in the United States on July 24, 2015, in 2D, [[3-D film|3D]], and [[IMAX Corporation|IMAX 3D]] formats. ''Pixels'' received generally negative reviews and grossed $244 million worldwide against a production budget of between $88 million and $129 million, similar to other video game films especially ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]'' (2012), ''[[Hitman: Agent 47]]'' (2015) and ''[[Need for Speed (film)|Need for Speed]]'' (2014). It was Sandler's last theatrically released film until the release of ''[[Uncut Gems]]'' (2019).\n\n==Plot==\nAt a video game arcade in 1982 with his friend Will Cooper, 13-year-old Sam Brenner seemingly loses a championship game of ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' to obnoxious Eddie \"The Fireblaster\" Plant. [[Videocassette]] footage of the event is included in a [[time capsule]] launched into space. In the present day, Brenner is an [[electronics]] installer while Cooper is an unpopular [[President of the United States]]. In [[Guam]], the [[Andersen Air Force Base]] is besieged by an extraterrestrial force attacking in the form of ''[[Galaga]]'' and a soldier is abducted.\n\nBrenner works at the home of divorced [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] Lieutenant Colonel Violet van Patten, and the two are separately summoned to the [[White House]]. Upon seeing the video footage and meeting with Ludlow \"The Wonder Kid\" Lamonsoff, Brenner deduces that the aliens have somehow mistaken the videocassette images for a declaration of war, and are attacking Earth with a strange technology that allows them to morph into the video games featured at the championship. The aliens interrupt a television broadcast using footage from the cassette, challenging the people of Earth to a battle where if the aliens win three times, they will conquer the planet. Brenner and Cooper are unable to stop one of the attacks as the [[Taj Mahal]] is damaged by the aliens in the form of ''[[Arkanoid]]'' and a bystander is abducted.\n\nBrenner and Ludlow train [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEALs]] to play the games. Violet develops [[raygun]]s that are effective against the aliens. The team later heads to [[London]], where the aliens attack [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in the form of ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]''. The soldiers begin to lose, so Brenner and Ludlow step in and shoot them down. The aliens send congratulations and a \"[[Achievement (video gaming)|trophy]]\" in the form of the ''[[Duck Hunt (video game)|Duck Hunt]]'' dog to an old lady.\n\nLudlow and Cooper retrieve Eddie from a prison sentence for fraud before going to [[New York City]]. There, the team must fight an alien taking the form of a giant [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]], playing as the [[Ghosts (Pac-Man)|ghosts]]. [[Toru Iwatani]], the creator of ''[[Pac-Man]]'', tries to reason with Pac-Man peacefully, but gets his hand bitten off. Brenner, Ludlow, and Eddie overcome the challenge using modified [[Mini Cooper]] cars, but Violet notices Eddie moved at supersonic speeds around the board. Brenner is able to trick Pac-Man into going after him once the effects of the cherry run out. They win [[Q*Bert]] as a trophy. During a celebratory party, however, the aliens announce that the challenge for the planet has been forfeited because someone cheated. Violet's son Matty discovers that not only did Eddie use a [[Cheat codes|speed cheat]] during the battle against Pac-Man, but while playing Donkey Kong against Brenner as well. Eddie flees while Matty is abducted by the aliens.\n\nThe aliens launch a massive attack on [[Washington, D.C.]] using an army of video game characters and enemies. Cooper joins the team, while Ludlow stays to fight. An alien takes the form of \"Lady Lisa\", a video game character on whom Ludlow has had a crush since childhood. Ludlow persuades Lisa to choose love and side with the humans as Eddie, wishing to make amends, returns to fight. Brenner, Violet and Cooper are summoned to the aliens' mothership for one last chance to save Earth, where they face their leader, who takes the form of [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]], on the starting level with the aliens' captives at the top level. As the group dodges barrels and fireballs, Brenner is losing hope until Matty reveals Eddie cheated at Donkey Kong, meaning that Brenner was the world's best Donkey Kong player. This restored his spirit and allowed  him to keep fighting. Once Brenner defeats Donkey Kong, the aliens' forces, including Lisa, disappear from Earth.\n\nThe team is hailed as heroes and Cooper manages to reach a peace agreement with the aliens. Eddie apologizes to Brenner for cheating, and although Ludlow is saddened that Lisa is gone, Q*Bert transforms its likeness to Lady Lisa. Brenner and Violet become a couple while Eddie gets to meet [[Serena Williams]] and [[Martha Stewart]]. The aliens restore everything on Earth, including Iwatani's hand, before their departure. A year later, Lady Lisa and Ludlow marry and have Q*Bert-like children.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- As billed in the opening credits title cards -->\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Sam Brenner, a former arcade video game champion, Cooper's childhood friend, and the leader of the Arcaders.<ref name=\"Adam\"/>\n** Anthony Ippolito as the young Brenner\n* [[Kevin James]] as Will \"[[Chewbacca|Chewie]]\" Cooper, the [[President of the United States]], Brenner's childhood friend, and a member of the Arcaders.<ref name=\"Adam\"/>\n** Jared Riley as the young Cooper\n* [[Michelle Monaghan]] as Lieutenant Colonel Violet van Patten, a unique weapons developer and specialist for the military and a member of the Arcaders.<ref name=\"Michelle\"/>\n* [[Peter Dinklage]] as Eddie \"The Fireblaster\" Plant, Brenner's former rival and a member of the Arcaders.<ref name=\"Peter\" /> The character's physical appearance and personality are styled after real-life ''[[Pac-Man]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' disqualified champion [[Billy Mitchell (video game player)|Billy Mitchell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=44358 |title=New Pixels Promo Arrives Online &#124; Movie News &#124; Empire |publisher=Empireonline.com |access-date=2015-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/02/donkey-kong-scoreboard-strips-billy-mitchells-high-score-claims/|title=Donkey Kong scoreboard strips Billy Mitchell's high score claims|date=2018-02-03|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-02-03}}</ref>\n** Andrew Bambridge as the young Eddie\n* [[Josh Gad]] as Ludlow \"The Wonder Kid\" Lamonsoff, a conspiracy-theory-obsessed genius with poor social skills and a member of the Arcaders.<ref name=\"Adam\"/>\n** Jacob Shinder as the young Ludlow\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Admiral James Porter, a military heavyweight.<ref name=\"Cox\" />\n* [[Sean Bean]] as Corporal Hill\n* [[Jane Krakowski]] as Jane Cooper, the [[First Lady of the United States]] and Cooper's wife.<ref name=\"Krakowski\" />\n* [[Affion Crockett]] as Sergeant Dylan Cohan, a soldier present during the Guam attack.\n* [[Ashley Benson]] as Lady Lisa, the protagonist of the video game ''Dojo Quest''.<ref name=\"Benson\" />\n* [[Matt Lintz]] as Matty van Patten, Violet's son.\n* [[Lainie Kazan]] as Mickey Lamonsoff, Ludlow's grandmother.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/07/pixels-adam-sandler-sexism|title=Pixels and Adam Sandler Have Killed the Boys-Only Summer Blockbuster - Vanity Fair|author=Katey Rich|magazine=Vanity Fair|access-date=March 28, 2016}}</ref>\n<!-- that's it for the opening credits -->\n\n<!-- Celebrity cameos -->\n[[Dan Aykroyd]] plays the [[Master of ceremonies|emcee]] of the video game championship.

Early tests began in October 2013, with the majority of the effects work starting after principal photography wrapped in September 2014, and finishing by June 2015. The video game characters would be built out of boxy [[voxel]]s to resemble the low resolution [[pixel]]-based arcades, while also emitting light and having [[raster scan]] defects in its animation to appear more like they came from a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT monitor]]. Along with the actual [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] sheets, a major inspiration to build the 3D versions was the cabinet art, where  Imageworks visual effects supervisor Daniel Kramer considered that \"was the intention the game creators wanted their technology to be, but the technology couldn't live up to creating that.\" The most complex characters to model were Q*Bert, which interacted the most with humans and had the problem of looking round despite being built out of cubes, and Donkey Kong, who the animators wanted to make sure remained recognizable even in different angles.<ref name=artofvfx/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/pixels-thinking-outside-the-voxel/|title=Pixels: thinking outside the voxel|date=July 26, 2015 |publisher=FXGuide.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinefex.com/blog/pixels/|title=\"Pixels\" - VFX Q&A|publisher=Cinefex Blog}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe score was composed by [[Henry Jackman]].
