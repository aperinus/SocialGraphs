It was written by [[Paula Milne]]. The original music score is composed by [[Andy Roberts (musician)|Andy Roberts]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Seattle]], Matt Leland is a straight-laced high school senior who lives with his workaholic father and 9-year-old twin siblings. Matt, whose mom had long ago left the family, has assumed the role of a parent for his young brother and sister. He becomes intrigued by a girl who lives across the lake from him, and spies on her through his telescope as she jet skis at night. He learns that the girl, Casey Roberts, is a new student at his high school and has just moved from [[Chicago]]. Matt asks her out and they go to a concert together. When Casey finds out Matt was using a telescope to spy on her, she angrily blows him off at first, but relents after he apologizes and the two polar opposites begin a whirlwind romance.\n\nMatt is drawn to Casey\u2019s free-spirited, fun-loving nature, and she confides to him she has a volatile personality where she goes from intense feelings of passion to fear and destructiveness. In one instance, Casey tries to get Matt\u2019s attention while he is taking the [[SAT|SATs]] by deliberately setting off the fire alarm at school, resulting in her suspension. Her suspension angers her parents, particularly her domineering father, and plans are made to send her away to a [[boarding school]]. That night, Casey [[Drug overdose|overdoses]] on [[Hypnotic|sleeping pills]], and she is [[Involuntary commitment|involuntarily committed]] to a psychiatric ward as a result.\n\nMatt visits Casey in the hospital to the detriment of his father, who scolds Matt for neglecting his studies and his kid siblings. The second time Matt visits Casey, the two manage to sneak out when the orderlies are preoccupied with other patients. The pair head to [[Mexico]] in Matt\u2019s SUV, but along the way, they wreck the car when Casey decides to play a \u201ctrust game\u201d with Matt by covering his eyes and giving him directions while he drives. They accept a ride from a salesman, but when the salesman makes an advance on Casey, she defends herself by putting out her lit cigarette on his face. The salesman throws her out of the car and a fight ensues between him and Matt. Matt and Casey are able to steal the car and drive off, leaving the salesman behind.\n\nAs the couple get closer to Mexico, Casey\u2019s behavior grows increasingly erratic and anxious, but Matt tries to help her and [[Codependency|selflessly puts her needs before his]]. He gradually realizes her mental health is beyond his assistance. After Casey has multiple emotional breakdowns, Matt reluctantly makes a phone call to her concerned parents. Mrs. Roberts tells Matt that her daughter is [[Bipolar disorder|manic depressive]] and needs her medication for her mood swings. She pleads for him to bring Casey home so her illness can be treated, but Matt refuses, fearing she will be locked up in a hospital again. Casey overhears him talking to her parents and misinterprets his call as a betrayal.\n\nCasey steals the keys to the car and drives off, with Matt stealing a truck to chase after her. He finds her alone in a desert where she threatens suicide and vows to shoot Matt with a gun she took from the glove compartment in the salesman's car. Exasperated, Matt tells her to go ahead and shoot him, but Casey can\u2019t bring herself to do it and breaks down. He runs to hug Casey and the couple return to Seattle, where Casey is readmitted to the psychiatric hospital. Matt goes back home, missing his time together with Casey. Some time later, Matt receives a letter from Casey saying she has moved back to Chicago and now feels significantly better. In her letter she writes, \"I had a dream last night, you were in it. You waved to me, maybe to say goodbye, it doesn't matter. Whatever happens, I'm proud of what we went through. It helps me get through the day. That, and you in my heart,\" implying a future for their relationship.\n\n==Main cast==\n{{Cast listing|* [[Chris O'Donnell]] as Matt Leland\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Casey Roberts\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as Eric\n* [[Joan Allen]] as Margaret Roberts\n* [[Jude Ciccolella]] as Richard Roberts\n* Amy Sakasitz as Joanna Leland\n* [[T.J.
