It was the opening-night film of the 2001 [[Venice Film Festival]] and was later released in a number of countries, including the United States.\n\n==Plot==\n\n''Where Does Your Voice Go When You\u2019re No More?''\n\nA New York thief (Edge), a tough-as-nails hundred-year-old woman (Angela), two brothers from the Wild West (Luke and Elijah), a revolutionary hell-bent on liberating Macedonia from the Ottoman Empire (The Teacher), and a beautiful pregnant woman (Neda), all cross paths in a tale that spans two continents and three centuries.

The music for the film was composed by [[Kiril D\u017eajkovski]]. [[Principal photography]] took place across three countries and two continents: [[Cologne]], [[New York City]], [[Mariovo]], [[Shtip]] and [[Bitola]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/06/news/mn-7066|title=Film Explores a Timeless 'Dust' Swirling in the Balkans|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=David|last=Holley|date=June 6, 2001}}</ref>\n\nAfter the international success of his debut [[Before the Rain (1994 film)|Before the Rain]], in 1995 Manchevski announced his next project, Dust. [[South Fork Pictures]] was producing, with [[Robert Redford]] and [[Michael Nozik]] as producers and [[Miramax]] as distributor. After a falling out between Manchevski and Miramax's [[Harvey Weinstein]], the film was eventually made as a British-Italian-German-Spanish-Macedonian co-production with the [[Film Consortium]]'s [[Chris Auty]] and [[Fandango (Italian company)|Fandango Films]]' [[Domenico Procacci]] leading the charge.\n\nFilming took part between April 2000 (New York) and October 2000 (Cologne and Macedonia). The film was edited in London in the fall/winter/spring 2000/2001. \n[[Moving Picture Company]] provided visual effects and animation.\n\n==Release==\n''Dust'' opened at the [[Venice Film Festival]] on 29 August 2001 and was later released in Italy on 5 April 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/apr/13/culture.features1|title=Guardian Features: 'Come on.

A number of critics accused Manchevski of having a political agenda and using the film to express it. ''[[The Evening Standard]]'' critic [[Alexander Walker (critic)|Alexander Walker]] claimed the film was portraying the Turkish army in an unflattering light and even called it racist. Several other critics saw the film as taking sides in the current armed conflict in Macedonia, in spite of the fact that the film was filmed before the hostilities began. Charges were nevertheless leveled that Manchevski's film was anti-Moslem, anti-Albanian and anti-Turkish. He did not respond to the accusations in Venice, presumably hoping the film would speak for itself. He, however, did respond later, explaining that the film is even-handed in its portrayal of brutal killers \u2013 it does not spare the Macedonians, Albanians, Turks, Greeks \u2013 or the Americans, for that matter. Even though the reviews (and even some of the original reviewers) were much more favorable and nuanced once the film moved from Venice to the regular theaters, the damage was done, and ''Dust'' never achieved the wide distribution expected from the follow-up to the phenomenally successful ''[[Before the Rain (1994 film)|Before the Rain]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kronauer|first=Iris|title=Wiping Dust in Venice|date=2015|publisher=Ars Lamia|location=Skopje|isbn=978-608-247-084-9|pages=274ff|edition=Manchevski Monograph|url=http://manchevski.com/docs/monograph/en/273-317_Monografija_EN_Milcho%20Manchevski_Iris%20Kronauer.pdf|accessdate=October 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://manchevski.com/docs/gunfight_at_old_macedonian_corral.pdf|title=Dust Film Review|website=Manchevski.com|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nLater, however, the film was reassessed in a number of essays focusing on its complex fractured narrative.\n\nDust caused quite a lot of stir; some of the reactions:\n* \u201cManchevski is a cubist of the silver screen.\u201d\n\n(The Globe and Mail)\n* \u201cRare visual intelligence.\u201d\n\n(Village Voice)\n* \u201cA potent, assured and ambitious piece of filmmaking\u2026There\u2019s enough culture clash that Dust oesn\u2019t need the equivalent of a Zen koan.\u201d\n\n(Elvis Mitchell, The New York Times)\n* \u201cAn extraordinary TransContinental, TransCentennial epic.
