Nelvana financed the third movie itself and it has so far grossed $6 million.}}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''''Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation''''' is a 1986 Canadian-American [[animation|animated]] [[musical film|musical]] [[fantasy film]] produced by [[Lexington Broadcast Services Company|LBS Communications]] and [[Nelvana]]. The third animated feature from Nelvana, it was directed by Dale Schott, written by [[Peter Sauder]] and produced by Nelvana's three founders ([[Michael Hirsh (producer)|Michael Hirsh]], [[Patrick Loubert]] and [[Clive A. Smith]]). It stars the voices of [[Alyson Court]], [[Cree Summer]], [[Maxine Miller]] and [[Hadley Kay]]. In the second film based on the [[Care Bears]] franchise, a character called The Great Wishing Star (voiced by [[Chris Wiggins]]) tells the origins of the Care Bears, and the story of their first Caring Mission. True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse lead the other Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins, as they come to the aid of Christy, a young camper who is tempted by an evil shape-shifting figure named Dark Heart. This is also the first appearance of the Care Bear Cubs, who also had their own line of toys.\n\n''A New Generation'' was made over a seven-month period at Nelvana's [[Toronto]] facilities, with additional work handled by Taiwan's [[Wang Film Productions]], and involved several crew members who had worked on the original ''[[The Care Bears Movie|Care Bears Movie]]''. Patricia Cullen served as composer, and Los Angeles musicians [[Dean Parks|Dean]] and [[Carol Parks]] worked on the film's six songs. [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company]], the US distributor for the first film, was originally set to release the sequel, but demands from the film's producers caused the company to give up. The worldwide distribution rights were then acquired by [[Columbia Pictures]].\n\nUpon its release in March 21, 1986, ''A New Generation'' was lambasted for its unnecessary merchandising tie-ins, poor animation quality, and frightening themes plotting onto a children's movie. Some of its key elements received comparisons to the German legend ''[[Faust]]'' and [[J. M. Barrie]]'s ''[[Peter Pan]]''. The film grossed only $8.5 million in North America, about a third of what the previous installment earned, and over $12 million worldwide. It was released on video in August 21, 1986, and the final home media release to date was a DVD issued in April 2003. The film was followed by ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'' in 1987.\n\n==Plot==\nBefore the events of ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'', somewhere out on the ocean, a yellow bear and a purple horse which live in a giant ship, look after a pack of baby animals known as the Care Bear Cubs and Care Bear Cousin Cubs.{{#tag:ref|Introduced by American Greetings in 1984,<ref name=guilford>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKk7r9uEgrIC&q=Care+Bears+Movie&pg=PA52|last=Pecora|first=Norma Odom|title=The Business of Children's Entertainment|chapter=The Industries: Television and Toy|pages=52\u201355|isbn=1-57230-774-9|year=2002|access-date=June 17, 2010|publisher=[[Guilford Press]]}}</ref> the Care Bear Cousins are a group of animals who serve as relatives to the Care Bears.<ref name=gainesville>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rKkRAAAAIBAJ&pg=4657,3747590&dq=dark-heart&hl=en|last=McLane|first=Mike|title=The Care Bears don't disappoint|date=March 28, 1986|access-date=June 21, 2010|work=[[Gainesville Sun]] Scene Magazine|page=20}}</ref> The group consists of different species, such as a monkey, an elephant and a penguin;<ref name=gainesville /> Noble Heart Horse is one of them.<ref name=cbm2>{{cite video |people=Schott, Dale (director) |date=1986 |title= Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation |medium=Animated film |publisher= Columbia Pictures (distributor) / Nelvana Limited / LBS Communications }}</ref> The characters made their official debut in ''The Care Bears Movie''.<ref name=guilford/><ref name=cbm1 />|group=nb}} During their journey, a red [[sea serpent]] threatens them. It is revealed that is none other than one of the many forms of Dark Heart, an evil [[shape-shifting]] mist that brings chaos upon the land. They escape by following a rainbow up to the sky, while the boat transforms into the Cloud Clipper.{{#tag:ref|The Cloud Clipper is seen and mentioned by name in \"Lost at Sea\", an episode of Nelvana's [[The Care Bears (TV series)|''Care Bears'' TV series]].<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Lost at Sea |series=The Care Bears Family |series-link=The Care Bears (TV series) |credits=Nichol, b.p.

This spirit gives the group their iconic \"symbols\", pictures that indicate each creature's role or specialty which is attached to their chests. True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse, as the characters are named, become founders of the Kingdom of Caring, a land which comprises Care-a-Lot and the Forest of Feelings.\n\nFor the Bears' first Caring Mission, True Heart and one of the cousins: Swift Heart Rabbit travel to [[Earth]], where they are led to a children's [[summer camp]]. At the camp, they meet three of its participants: a kind and heartwarming young girl named Christy, and her best mates, the twins John and Dawn. Christy and the twins are concerned because a boastful boy nicknamed the \"Camp Champ\" always emerges victorious in showdowns. They decide to confront him, only for him to assign them to trash duty. A distraught Christy resolves to run away with her friends, only to get lost in the nearby forest all alone. True Heart soon finds John and Dawn. Not knowing what to do with them, True Hearts rescues them from the forest's outskirts and brings them to the Kingdom of Caring. After they arrive, the children hear a bell toll from the Caring Meter, which tells the Bears how much caring is taking place on Earth. Noble Heart and True Heart tell them to babysit the Cubs, before they leave to search for Dark Heart and Christy.\n\nMeanwhile, in the forest, Christy meets Dark Heart (disguised as a human boy) for the first time, and asks him to make her the new Camp Champ. He grants her that wish, warning her she must pay him back with one favor with no questions asked, and walks away while she finally encounters his mates. Aware of Dark Heart's potential, True Heart and Noble Heart take action by moving the Bear Cubs to Care-a-Lot, and the Cousin Cubs to the Forest of Feelings. Both sets quickly grow up to become the Care Bear Family.\n\nLater, while the Bears and cousins decide to celebrate the Kingdom of Caring's anniversary and prepare a party for the Kingdom's founders, Dark Heart sneaks into Care-a-Lot disguised as a [[repairman]] so that he can capture the whole Family. A cluster of Star Buddies, an army of stars which act as a defense to the kingdom (under the command of the Great Wishing Star), drives him off; he then morphs into a raging red cloud of mists and engage in a decisive battle. The Bears shoot light at him from their bellies, forming their \"Care Bear Stare\"; the Cousins also help by using their \"Care Cousin Call\". After Dark Heart is fended off, True Heart and Noble Heart decide to search and annihilate him, and leave the Bears to handle missions all by themselves.\n\nDuring their patrol, the Bears and Cousins spot Christy stranded in a canoe within a lake, but before they can rescue her, Dark Heart appears again as an aura of mist and shoots cursed bolts before the team. The family decides to retaliate, only to be captured by his evil red magic and being trapped into his magic bag, which was the favor he wanted Christy to do all along. The few Family members at hand determine that she has teamed up with him. This prompts Tenderheart Bear to hold a [[press conference|press wheel]] at the Hall of Hearts. John and Dawn joins the conference, to listen to Tenderheart Bear discuss his plans to successfully put down Dark Heart.\n\nLater in the night, Dark Heart brainwashes everyone staying at the camp, causing them to wreak havoc around the zone. The Bears and Cousins search for any stranded Family members, and to engage Dark Heart again, only for Dark Heart to imprison them\u2014first in cages, then freezing them inside big [[ruby|rubies]] hanging from a chandelier. Meanwhile, John and Dawn tell Christy of their conviction to rescue the Family from the evil entity. Feeling guilt, she finally comes to her senses and pays him back by admitting what she has done. Despite this, her bargain with Dark Heart is over, and finally admits that he must be expelled one and for all.\n\nTrue Heart, Noble Heart (whom Dark Heart tricked into leaving the family alone while chasing his shadow), John and Dawn partake in a heist to reach and completely destroy Dark Heart inside his lair. After sending Grumpy Bear and other two mates in an attempt to steal a necklace with a key, Dark Heart awakens, revealing his mystical power. Christy soon joins the heist and threatens Dark Heart to bring the bears down. He refuses, and shows Christy the chandelier in which the Family is trapped. After an argument with Christy, Dark Heart warns her that if she saved his life, she should run and save hers, before finally shooting large bolts of red magic into True Heart and Noble Heart. Both confront the evil entity, which transforms again into an aura of red magic. Christy wants a ceasefire and attempts to intervene, only to be killed by one of Dark Heart's bolts of lightning. Christy flicks a marble into a lever holding the chandelier before dying. When the chandelier breaks, the family confronts the antagonist one final time, which soon retaliates by firing bolts of curse to the family yet again. Thinking that he is almost rid of everyone, he looks at Christy, which in her voice, tells him that be it good or bad, he is still a human. Dark Heart flies to her and repents for killing her.\n\nDark Heart's evil magic finally turns off forever and begs the family to bring her back to life. In a ritual meant to resurrect her, Dark Heart finally opens his mind and stops calling himself Dark Heart, while he chants that he cares about Christy along the others. Christy comes back to life, and due to Dark Heart's magic perishing, his own lair collapses. After a successful escape, Dark Heart finally is set free from the dark magic, and finally turns into a human, much to everyone's delight.\n\nAfter a large celebration, the bears bid farewell to the campers, returning to their promises land. The Great Wishing Star finally delivers an ending speech, which is followed by Harmony Bear and Brave Heart paddling a rowboat past the castle that they raised at and flashbacks of the family's childhood across their promised kingdom.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Per order onscreen; please do not alter without a valid reason.
