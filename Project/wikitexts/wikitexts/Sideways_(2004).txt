A [[film adaptation]] of [[Rex Pickett]]'s 2004 [[Sideways (novel)|novel of the same name]], ''Sideways'' follows two men in their forties, Miles Raymond ([[Paul Giamatti]]), a depressed teacher and unsuccessful writer, and Jack Cole ([[Thomas Haden Church]]), a past-his-prime actor, who take a week-long road trip to [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara County wine country]] to [[Bachelor party|celebrate]] Jack's upcoming wedding. [[Sandra Oh]] and [[Virginia Madsen]] also star as women they encounter during their trip. The film premiered at the [[2004 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 13, 2004, and was released in the United States on October 22, 2004. ''Sideways'' received widespread acclaim from critics and won [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] at the [[77th Academy Awards]]. It was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (Haden Church) and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (Madsen). It is regarded as one of the best films of the 2000s.\n\n==Plot==\nMiles Raymond is an unpublished writer, a [[Oenophilia|wine aficionado]], and a depressed, middle-aged English teacher living in [[San Diego]]. He takes Jack Cole, his soon-to-be-married actor friend and former college roommate, on a road trip through the [[Santa Ynez Valley]] wine country. Jack now does commercial [[voice-overs]] and plans to enter his future father-in-law's successful real estate business. Soon after the trip begins, Miles insists on stopping to see his mother in Oxnard, as it is the day before her birthday. He steals a thousand dollars from her room that night. The men sneak out the next morning to avoid the birthday gathering.\n\nMiles wants to spend the week relaxing, playing golf, and enjoying good food and wine. However, much to Miles' consternation, Jack is on the prowl and wants one last sexual fling before settling into domestic life. In the wine country, the pair dine at [[The Hitching Post| The Hitching Post II]]. Jack sees that Maya, a waitress with whom Miles is casually acquainted, is interested in Miles; Miles thinks she is only being professionally friendly. Jack lies to Maya that Miles' manuscript has been accepted for publication, although it is only being considered. At a wine tasting the next day, Jack arranges a double date with a wine pourer named Stephanie, who is also acquainted with Maya.\n\nDuring the date, Miles gets [[drunk dialing|drunk and telephones]] Victoria, his ex-wife, after learning from Jack that she has remarried and will be bringing her new husband to Jack's wedding. The two couples go to Stephanie's home, where she and Jack adjourn to her bedroom for sex. Miles and Maya connect through their mutual interest in wine, and Miles kisses her awkwardly. As they are leaving separately, Miles gives her a copy of his manuscript, which Maya had earlier expressed interest in reading.\n\nJack claims to have fallen in love with Stephanie and tells Miles he wants to move to Santa Ynez Valley to be closer to her. After spending time with Jack and Stephanie at wineries and a picnic, Miles and Maya return to her apartment and have sex. The next day, Miles lets it slip that Jack is to be married. Disgusted with the men's dishonesty, Maya dumps Miles.\n\nJack and Miles go to a winery that Miles finds subpar. After hearing from his literary agent that his manuscript has been rejected, an upset Miles pesters the pourer for a \"full pour\" of wine. When the server refuses, Miles drinks from the [[Spittoon|spit bucket]], creating a scene. Jack intervenes and drives Miles back to the motel. Upon arrival, they meet Stephanie, who breaks Jack's nose with her motorcycle helmet, screaming about being lied to. Miles takes Jack to the [[Emergency department|ER]] and leaves Maya an apologetic voice message, admitting that his book is not going to be published. That night, Jack hooks up with a waitress named Cammi, despite Miles's protests. Later, Jack returns to the motel naked, having been caught having sex with Cammi by her husband. Jack begs Miles to help him retrieve his wallet, which contains custom wedding rings. Miles sneaks into the house, where he discovers Cammi and her husband having sex. Miles grabs the wallet and runs, barely escaping the nude and irate husband.\n\nJack intentionally drives Miles's car into a tree so it looks as if he broke his nose in an accident. The pair return to the fianc\u00e9e's home, where Jack is warmly received by the family.\n\nFollowing the wedding ceremony, Miles runs into his ex-wife Victoria and meets her new husband, Ken. Victoria tells Miles that she is pregnant. Miles absconds before the reception, driving back to his San Diego apartment. Alone, he drinks his prized wine, a 1961 [[Ch\u00e2teau Cheval Blanc]], from a disposable styrofoam soda cup at a [[fast-food]] restaurant. Miles returns to the routine of teaching school. One day he receives a voicemail from Maya, who says she enjoyed his manuscript and invites him to visit. Miles drives back to wine country and knocks on Maya's door.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast, order and roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Miles Raymond\n* [[Thomas Haden Church]] as Jack Cole\n* [[Virginia Madsen]] as Maya Randall\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as Stephanie\n* [[Marylouise Burke]] as Mrs. Raymond, Miles' Mother\n* [[Jessica Hecht]] as Victoria Cortland\n* Lee Brooks as Ken Cortland\n* Missy Doty as Cammi\n* [[M.
