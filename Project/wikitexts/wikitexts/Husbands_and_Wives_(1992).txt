The film debuted shortly after the end of Allen and Farrow's romantic and professional partnership, and was the last of their 13 films together. The movie is filmed by [[Carlo Di Palma]] with a handheld camera style and features documentary-like interviews with the characters interspersed with the story.\n\n''Husbands and Wives'', released by [[TriStar Pictures]], was Allen's first film as sole director for a studio other than [[United Artists]] or [[Orion Pictures]] (both now part of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]) since ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'' (1969). It received critical acclaim despite being a box-office failure, and was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (Judy Davis) and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] (Woody Allen).\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is about two couples: Jack and Sally, and Gabe and Judy. The film starts when Jack and Sally arrive at Gabe and Judy's apartment and announce their separation. Gabe is shocked, but Judy takes the news personally and is very hurt. Still confused, they go out for dinner at a Chinese restaurant.\n\nA few weeks later Sally visits the apartment of a colleague. They plan to go out together to the [[opera]] and then to dinner. Sally asks if she can use his phone, and calls Jack. Learning from him that he has met someone, she accuses him of having had an affair during their marriage.\n\nJudy and Gabe are introduced to Jack's new girlfriend, Sam, an aerobics trainer. While Judy and Sam shop, Gabe calls Jack's new girlfriend a \"cocktail waitress\" and tells him that he is crazy for leaving Sally for her. About a week later, Judy introduces Sally to Michael, Judy's magazine colleague, in whom Judy herself is clearly interested. Michael asks Sally out, and they begin dating; Michael is smitten, but Sally is dissatisfied with the relationship.\n\nMeanwhile, Gabe has developed a friendship with a young student of his, Rain, and has her read the manuscript of his novel. She comments on its brilliance but has several criticisms, to which Gabe reacts defensively.\n\nAt a party, Jack learns from a friend that Sally is seeing someone and flees with Sam in a jealous rage. They have an intense argument, and Jack drives back to his house to find Sally in bed with Michael. He asks Sally to give their marriage another chance, but she tells him to leave.\n\nLess than two weeks later, however, Jack and Sally are back together and the couple meets Judy and Gabe for dinner like old times. After dinner, Judy and Gabe get into an argument at their apartment about her not sharing her poetry. After Gabe makes a failed pass at her, Judy tells him she thinks the relationship is over; a week later Gabe moves out. Judy begins seeing Michael.\n\nGabe goes to Rain's 21st birthday party and gives her a music box as a present. She asks him to kiss her, and though the two share a romantic moment, Gabe tells her they should not pursue it any further. As he walks home in the rain, he realizes that he has ruined his relationship with Judy.\n\nMichael tells Judy he needs time alone and he can't help still having feelings for Sally. Angry and hurt, Judy walks out into the rain. Highlighting her \"passive-aggressiveness,\" Michael follows and begs her to stay with him. A year and a half later, they marry.\n\nIn the end, the audience sees a pensive Jack and Sally back together. Jack and Sally admit their marital problems still exist (her frigidity is not solved), but they find they accept their problems as simply the price they have to pay to remain together.\n\nGabe is living alone because he says he is not dating for the time being, as he does not want to hurt anyone, including himself. The film ends with an immediate cut to black after Gabe asks the unseen documentary crew, \"Can I go? Is this over?\"\n\n==Cast==\nThe cast includes (in credits order):\n{{div col}}\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Gabe Roth\n* [[Mia Farrow]] as Judy Roth\n* [[Judy Davis]] as Sally Simmons\n* [[Sydney Pollack]] as Jack Simmons\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Rain\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as Michael Gates\n* [[Lysette Anthony]] as Sam\n* [[Cristi Conaway]] as Shawn Grainger, call girl\n* Timothy Jerome as Paul, Sally's date\n* [[Ron Rifkin]] as Richard, Rain's analyst\n* [[Bruce Jay Friedman]] as Peter Styles\n* Jeffrey Kurland as interviewer-narrator (voice)\n* [[Benno C.
