It stars [[Jim Carrey]], [[Liam Aiken]], [[Emily Browning]], [[Timothy Spall]], [[Catherine O'Hara]], [[Billy Connolly]], [[Cedric the Entertainer]], [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]], [[Jennifer Coolidge]], and [[Meryl Streep]], as well as [[Jude Law]] as the voice of Lemony Snicket.\n\n[[Nickelodeon Movies]] purchased the [[film rights]] to Handler's book series in 2000 and soon began development of a film with [[Barry Sonnenfeld]] attached to direct. Handler adapted the screenplay and courted Carrey for Count Olaf. Sonnenfeld eventually left over budget concerns in January 2003 and Brad Silberling took over. [[Robert Gordon (screenwriter)|Robert Gordon]] rewrote Handler's script, and [[principal photography]] started in November 2003. The film was entirely shot using [[sound stage]]s and [[backlot]]s at [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Downey Studios]].\n\n''Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events'' was released theatrically in the United States on December 17, 2004, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film received positive reviews from critics, with many praising its production values and performances (particularly Carrey's performance), while some criticized its comical tone and short length. The film grossed $211 million worldwide. At the [[77th Academy Awards]], it won the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Academy Award for Best Makeup]] and received nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]], [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn a [[clock tower]], investigator Lemony Snicket begins writing a documentation regarding the whereabouts of the Baudelaire children: 14-year-old [[inventor]] Violet, her 12-year-old [[bibliophile]] brother Klaus, and their [[wikt: mordacious|mordacious]] baby sister Sunny. One day, the children are orphaned when a mysterious fire destroys their mansion, killing their parents. Mr. Poe, the family banker, manages their affairs and leaves them in the care of Count Olaf, a nefarious stage actor intent upon obtaining their family fortune, which will remain in the custody of the bank until Violet turns [[Age of majority|eighteen]]. He forces them to do heavy chores and belittles them.\n\nDriving back from the court where Olaf has legally obtained custody of the children, he stops to go into a [[general store]], leaving them locked in the car parked directly on train tracks with a [[Pennsylvania Railroad class T1|train]] heading towards them. They manage to divert the train by building a device to remotely activate the railroad switch. Mr. Poe arrives and takes them away, thinking that Olaf was allowing Sunny to drive.\n\nThe orphans are taken to their uncle, Dr. Montgomery Montgomery, an eccentric but kind [[Herpetology|herpetologist]]. However, Olaf arrives disguised as his assistant \"Stephano\". The orphans attempt to warn him, but he believes he is after the Incredibly Deadly Viper, a giant [[misnomer]] snake, in his laboratory. Montgomery is discovered dead shortly after, his death blamed on the viper. They are almost placed in Stephano's care by Mr. Poe, but Sunny proves his guilt by showing the viper is harmless and he escapes.\n\nMr. Poe leaves them with their Aunt Josephine, a grammar-obsessed widow with [[panphobia]]. Olaf appears, disguised as a sea captain named \"Captain Sham\", to meddle with their plans again. One day, Josephine is not at the house, leaving an apparent suicide note entrusting them to Captain Sham. Klaus deduces that Olaf forced her to forge the note, but she left a hidden message revealing her location. They sail to the cave where she is hiding and rescue her but attract [[leech]]es. Olaf appears and takes the children, leaving Josephine to be eaten by the leeches. Mr. Poe finds him with the children, and Olaf pretends to have rescued them. Mr. Poe is fooled and gives the children back to him.\n\nOlaf plans a play titled \"The Marvelous Marriage\", starring Violet and him as a bride and groom. Klaus's suspicions reveal that he is planning to take advantage of the play to really marry Violet in an attempt to get the fortune, using legally recognized vows and a bona fide justice of the peace. He locks Sunny up in a birdcage, threatening to drop her to her death if Violet refuses to take part in the play.\n\nKlaus escapes and finds a hidden tower in Olaf's house, where he discovers a large window with a set of lenses that, if positioned correctly, can focus the rays of the sun. He realizes that this was the [[arson|method used to set fire]] to the Baudelaire mansion. Using the window, Klaus manages to burn the marriage certificate, leading to Olaf's arrest, where he is sentenced to live some of the children's troubles, which he disappears sometime later.\n\nViolet, Klaus, and Sunny are taken to visit the charred remains of their old home one last time. A lost letter from their parents finally arrives, and inside is a [[Telescope|spyglass]] announcing their family's secret society. Snicket finishes writing his documentation and hides the papers in the clock tower for his publisher to find. He concludes that despite the siblings' recent unfortunate events, they have each other. The Baudelaires are driven by Mr. Poe to their next home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as [[Count Olaf]], a villainous stage actor and master of disguise who lusts after the Baudelaire family fortune.\n** [[Count Olaf|Dr. Stephano]], Count Olaf's first disguise who pretends to be Dr. Montgomery's new assistant, he later kills Montgomery and tries to frame The Incredibly Deadly Viper but fails.\n** [[Count Olaf|Captain Julio Sham]], a peg leg [[sea captain]] and Count Olaf's second disguise.
