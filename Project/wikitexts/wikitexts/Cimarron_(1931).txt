The [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|winning script was written]] by [[Howard Estabrook]] based on the 1930 [[Edna Ferber]] novel ''[[Cimarron (novel)|Cimarron]]''. It would be [[RKO]]'s most expensive production up to that date, and its winning of the top [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Oscar for Outstanding Production]] would be one of only two for Outstanding Production ever won by that studio. It is also the first of only three Westerns to ever win the top honor at the Academy Awards (the others being ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' in 1990 and ''[[Unforgiven (1992 film)|Unforgiven]]'' in 1992). Epic in scope, spanning forty years from 1889 to 1929, it was a critical success, although it did not recoup its production costs during its initial run in 1931.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/cimarron-v87266| title=Cimarron (1960)| first=Mark| last=Deming| website=[[AllMovie]]| access-date=April 21, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Oklahoma land rush of 1889]] prompts thousands to travel to the [[Oklahoma Territory]] to grab free government land; Yancey Cravat ([[Richard Dix]]) and his young bride, Sabra ([[Irene Dunne]]) cross the border from Kansas to join the throngs. In the ensuing race, Yancey is outwitted by a young prostitute, Dixie Lee ([[Estelle Taylor]]), who takes the prime piece of real estate, the Bear Creek claim, that Yancey had targeted for himself.\n\nHis plans for establishing a ranch thwarted, Yancey moves into the town of [[Osage, Oklahoma|Osage]], a boomer town, where he confronts and kills Lon Yountis ([[Stanley Fields (actor)|Stanley Fields]]), an outlaw who had killed the prior publisher of the local newspaper. Having a background in publishing himself, Yancey establishes the ''Oklahoma Wigwam'', a weekly newspaper, to help turn the frontier camp into a respectable town. After the birth of their daughter, Donna, a gang of outlaws threatens Osage, led by \"The Kid\" ([[William Collier Jr.]]), who happens to be an old acquaintance of Yancey's. To save the town, Yancey faces and kills The Kid.\n\nBeset by guilt over his killing of The Kid, when another land rush appears, Yancey leaves Sabra and his children to participate in settling the [[Cherokee Outlet|Cherokee Strip]]. After his departure, Sabra takes over the publication of the ''Oklahoma Wigwam'', and raises her children until Yancey returns five years later, just in time to represent Dixie Lee, who had been charged with being a public nuisance, and win her acquittal.\n\nOsage continues to grow, as does the Territory of Oklahoma, which gains statehood in 1907 and benefits from the early oil boom of the 1900s, including the Native American tribes, that Yancey supports, through editorials in his newspaper, after which Yancey once again disappears from Osage for several years. At the time, Sabra is vehemently anti-Native American, despite her son's involvement with an Indian woman. Years later, when Sabra becomes the first female member of Congress from the state of Oklahoma, she lauds the virtues of her then Indian daughter-in-law.\n\nSabra and Yancey are reunited one final time when she rushes to his side after he has rescued numerous oil drillers from a devastating explosion. He dies in her arms.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Dix]] as Yancey Cravat\n* [[Irene Dunne]] as Sabra Cravat\n* [[Estelle Taylor]] as Dixie Lee\n* [[Nance O'Neil]] as Felice Venable\n* [[William Collier Jr.]] as The Kid\n* [[Roscoe Ates]] as Jesse Rickey\n* [[George E.

Filming began in the summer of 1930 at Jasmin Quinn Ranch outside of [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], where the land rush scenes were shot. More than twenty-eight cameramen, and numerous camera assistants and photographers, were used to capture scenes of more than 5,000 costumed extras, covered wagons, buckboards, surreys, and bicyclists as they raced across grassy hills and prairie to stake their claim. Cinematographer Edward Cronjager planned out every take (that recalled the scenes of ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' some fifteen years earlier) in accordance with Ferber's descriptions. In order to film key scenes for this production, RKO purchased 89 acres in [[Encino, Los Angeles|Encino]] where construction of [[Art Director]] [[Max Ree]]'s [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning design of a complete western town and a three-block modern main street were built to represent the fictional Oklahoma [[boomtown]] of Osage. These award-winning sets eventually formed the nucleus of RKO's expansive [[movie ranch]], in Encino, where other RKO (and non-RKO) films were later shot.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/14798/cimarron#articles-reviews?articleId=117928| title=Cimarron (1931): Articles| website=Turner Classic Movies| access-date=April 21, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nRKO Radio Pictures premiered ''Cimarron'' at the RKO [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)]] in New York City on January 26, 1931, to much praise, and then on February 6 a Los Angeles [[Orpheum Theatre (Los Angeles, California)|Orpheum Theatre]] premiere followed, that also included personal appearances of [[Richard Dix]] and [[Irene Dunne]], a stage show and an augmented orchestra. Three days later, the movie was released to theaters throughout the nation. Despite being a critical success, the extremely high budget and ongoing [[Great Depression|Depression]] combined against the film. While it was a commercial success in line with other films of the day, [[RKO Pictures]] could not at first recoup their heavy investment in the film, that ended up losing $565,000.<ref name=RKO /> However, it recouped some more money on a 1935 re-release<ref name=RKO /> that enjoyed another premiere in [[Oklahoma City]] at the ([[John Eberson]] designed) Midwest Theatre. The movie remained RKO's most expensive film until 1939's ''[[Gunga Din (film)|Gunga Din]]'' (that filmed exteriors around the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] [[Alabama Hills]] range, but had one scene shot on RKO's [[movie ranch]] in Encino).<ref name=\"rko\" />\n\nReviews by film critics were overwhelmingly positive at the time. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' led off its review with, \"An elegant example of super film making and a big money picture. This is a spectacular western away from all others. It holds action, sentiment, sympathy, thrills and comedy \u2013 and 100% clean. Radio Pictures has a corker in 'Cimarron'.\" The review went on to praise the actors, particularly Dix and Oliver, as well as the direction, stating, \"Wesley Ruggles apparently gets the full credit for this splendid and heavy production. His direction misses nothing in the elaborate scenes, as well as in the usual film making procedure.\" The magazine specifically pointed out the quality of the make-up in the aging of the principle players, who have to go through forty years on-screen.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://variety.com/1931/film/reviews/cimarron-1200410377/| magazine=Variety| title=Review: Cimarron| date=January 27, 1931| access-date=August 10, 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810182847/http://variety.com/1931/film/reviews/cimarron-1200410377/| archive-date=August 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Mordaunt Hall]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' also gave the film a stellar review, calling it, \"A graphic and engrossing screen conception of Edna Ferber's widely read novel ...\", and also praised the handling of the passage of time in this epic.

''Cimarron'' does not follow the rules of story construction... It is, in short, a graphic interpretation of a portion of history, the history of the state of Oklahoma from the time of the first great land rush until the present.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last=Smyth |first=J.

''Cimarron'' currently holds a \"Rotten\" 52% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 31 reviews, with a [[weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 4.9/10.
