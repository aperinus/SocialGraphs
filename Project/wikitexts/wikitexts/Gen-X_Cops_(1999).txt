Jack is the tough cool one of the group. He will do almost anything to win.\n\n'''Match''' (Played by [[Stephen Fung]]) Match is the playboy of the group, as he is always more concerned with the girl instead of the task at hand.\n\n'''Alien''' (Played by [[Sam Lee (actor)|Sam Lee]]) As his name suggests, Alien is the goofy guy of the bunch. He doesn't really like authority or doing much work but does his fair share in the group.\n\n'''Y2K''' (Played by Grace Ip) Y2K is the girl of the group. She has skills in fighting and computers. She is mainly the group\u2019s techie.

He is the mastermind behind the stealing and smuggling of the jet fuel explosives. He is driven by revenge. He believes that a man named Shimada is the reason his father was killed. And his goal is to eventually avenge his father by killing Shimada.\n\n'''Daniel''' (Played by [[Daniel Wu]]) is Akatora's man in Hong Kong. He kills his own brother to show his loyalty. Once his girlfriend leaves him for Match, he takes Jack with him and eventually is killed by Akatora for bringing a cop to his hideout.\n\n'''Lok''' (Played by [[Francis Ng]]) is a very good friend of Dinosaur.

But she had a fling with Match in Canada. For her it was much more serious. The only reason she came to Hong Kong with Daniel was to find Match. She leaves Daniel for Match in the end.\n\n===The Police Force===\n'''Inspector Chan''' aka '''Inspector Smart''' (played by [[Eric Tsang]]) Inspector Chan was the one who recruited the Gen-X Cops.
