Michael William Logan, a Catholic priest, [[Anne Baxter]] as Ruth Grandfort, and [[Karl Malden]] as Inspector Larrue.\n\nThe film is based on a 1902 French play by [[Paul Anthelme Bourde|Paul Anthelme]] titled ''Nos deux consciences'' (''Our Two Consciences''), which Hitchcock saw in the 1930s. The screenplay was written by [[George Tabori]].<ref>[https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/78777/i-confess#notes \"''I Confess'': Notes\"]. ''[[Turner Classic Movies]]''. Accessed October 15, 2022.</ref>\n\nFilming took place largely on location in Quebec City with numerous shots of the city landscape and interiors of its churches and other emblematic buildings, such as the [[Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Montgomery Clift in I Confess trailer.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Montgomery Clift in the ''I Confess'' film trailer]]\nFather Logan ([[Montgomery Clift]]) is a devout Catholic priest in Ste. Marie's Church in Quebec City. He employs German immigrants Otto Keller ([[O.E. Hasse]]) and his wife Alma ([[Dolly Haas]]) as caretaker and housekeeper. Keller also works part-time as a gardener for a shady lawyer called Villette ([[Ovila L\u00e9gar\u00e9]]).\n\nThe film begins late one evening as a man wearing a [[cassock]] walks away from Villette's house where Villette lies dead on the floor. Shortly afterward, in the church confessional, Keller confesses to Father Logan that he accidentally killed Villette while trying to rob him. Keller tells his wife about his deed and assures her that the priest will not say anything because he is forbidden from [[Seal of the Confessional in the Catholic Church|revealing information acquired through confessions]].\n\nThe next morning, Keller goes to Villette's house at his regularly scheduled gardening time and reports Villette's death to the police. Father Logan also goes to the crime scene after hearing Mrs. Keller mention that her husband is there and finds the police there. Logan is interviewed by Inspector Larrue ([[Karl Malden]]), who witnesses Logan talking to a woman after he leaves.\n\nAt the police station, two young girls tell Inspector Larrue they saw a priest leaving Villette's house. This prompts Larrue to call Father Logan in for more questioning, but Logan refuses to provide any information about the murder. Foolishly and prematurely suspecting Logan, Larrue orders a detective to follow Logan and contacts Crown Prosecutor Robertson ([[Brian Aherne]]), who is attending a party hosted by Ruth Grandfort ([[Anne Baxter]]), the woman Logan talked to outside of Villette's house, and her husband Pierre (Roger Dann), a member of the Quebec legislature. Ruth overhears Robertson discussing Logan, and Larrue's detective discovers her identity by following her home the next day after she meets with Logan to warn him that he is a suspect.\n\nSuspecting everyone the active Pastor speaks to as a suspect, Larrue calls Ruth and Logan in for questioning, and Ruth blurts out the truth, narrating a series of flashbacks: She and Logan fell in love when they were childhood friends, but he went to fight in World War II with the [[The Royal Regina Rifles|Regina Rifle Regiment]] and eventually stopped writing to her. She eventually married Pierre, for whom she had been working as secretary. The day after Logan returned from the war, he and Ruth spent the day on a nearby island. A storm forced them to shelter for the night in a gazebo, and Villette found them there in the morning, recognizing Ruth as Mrs. Grandfort. The next time Ruth saw Logan was several years later when he was ordained as a priest.\n\nVillette had recently asked Ruth to persuade her husband to help him escape a tax scandal, with the condition that if she refused, he would publicize the night she spent with Logan. She met with Logan on the night of the murder, and Logan agreed to intercede with Villette.\n\n[[File:Anne Baxter in I Confess trailer.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Anne Baxter in the ''I Confess'' trailer]]\n\nRuth's meeting with Father Logan occurred between 9 and 11 pm on the night of the murder, but Larrue shows Robinson Villette's autopsy report that indicates that Villette couldn't have died before 11:30 pm. The fact that Ruth and Logan concluded their meeting at 11 pm leaves Logan without an alibi. He also had a solid motive for killing Villette in that Villette was blackmailing Ruth.\n\nKnowing he will be arrested, Logan turns himself in the next day at Larrue's office. Keller has planted the bloody cassock among Logan's belongings, and when Logan is tried in court, Keller testifies that he saw Logan enter the church after the murder, acting suspiciously.\n\nThe jury concludes that Father Logan is not guilty, due to insufficient evidence, but the crowd outside the courthouse mobs Logan as he leaves the court. This upsets Keller's wife to such an extent that she starts to shout that Logan was innocent. Keller, realizing that he's about to be revealed as the murderer, shoots Alma, resulting in her death. He then flees but is pursued by police officers.\n\nLarrue finally realizes that Keller is the murderer, corners him in the grand ballroom of the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac, and tricks him into confessing the murder. Keller, suspecting that Father Logan had betrayed him to the police, threatens to shoot Logan. However, Logan prefers peace over violence, and advances into the ballroom to talk with Keller.\n\nImmediately followed by police officers, Logan talks with Keller, his main intention being to prevent a ballroom gunfight; but Keller shoots at Logan.\n\nA police sharpshooter shoots Keller when Keller tries to shoot Logan; and Keller calls to Father Logan ''[[wikt:in extremis|in extremis]]'' and dies immediately after asking Logan for forgiveness.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Montgomery Clift]] as Fr.

In the original screenplay, following the source play, the priest and his lover had an illegitimate baby, and the priest was executed at the end of the film. These elements were removed at the insistence of executives at [[Warner Brothers]] who feared a negative reaction.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book| title=Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness and Light| author=Mcgilligan, Patrick| date=September 14, 2004| publisher=HarperCollins| isbn=978-0-0609-8827-2| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bf5l0qtZabMC| page=456| access-date=January 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock first hired [[Anita Bj\u00f6rk]] as the female lead after seeing her in ''[[Miss Julie (1951 film)|Miss Julie]]'' (1951).

When the local diocese read the original script by [[George Tabori]], it objected to the priest's execution and rescinded its permission.

He could not understand Clift's [[Method acting]] technique and quickly became frustrated with Clift when he blew take after take for failing to follow Hitchcock's instructions.<ref name=laguardia/>\n\nCognizant of the difficulty non-Catholics would have in understanding the priest's reluctance to expose Keller, Hitchcock said:<ref name=\"google2\">{{cite book| title=Alfred Hitchcock: The Legacy of Victorianism| author=Cohen, Paula Marantz| date=July 20, 1995| publisher=University Press of Kentucky| isbn=978-0-8131-0850-6| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EPq6heCUbjsC| page=97| access-date=January 1, 2015}}</ref>{{blockquote|We Catholics know that a priest cannot disclose the secret of the confessional, but the Protestants, the atheists, and the agnostics all say, 'Ridiculous!

[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''The New York Times'' faulted an \"obviously padded\" and \"a suspenseless script,\" explaining that \"only the most credulous patron will be worried for very long that the hero will not be delivered from his dilemma by some saving grace. And this realization well unburdens the situation of any real suspense.\" Crowther's review concluded that \"Mr. Hitchcock does manage to inject little glints of imagery and invent little twists of construction that give the film the smooth, neat glitter of his style. Shot on location in Quebec, it has a certain atmospheric flavor, too. But it never gets up and goes places. It just ambles and drones along.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |date=March 23, 1953 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1953/03/23/archives/the-screen-in-review-i-confess-hitchcock-drama-of-priests-dilemma.html?searchResultPosition=1 |title=The Screen In Review |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=28 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the film was \"short of the suspense one would expect and overlong on talk,\" although it did note \"a number of top-flight performances.\"<ref>{{cite news |date=February 11, 1953 |title=Film Reviews: I Confess |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=6 |url=https://archive.org/details/variety189-1953-02/page/n69/mode/2up?q=montgomery}}</ref> [[Richard L. Coe]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote in a negative review that the film \"asks for more than the usual suspension of disbelief\" because \"the priest is not helpless, a fact which the writers and director attempt to forget at the cost of the film's credibility from the earliest reel. It would certainly seem that so young a priest's superiors would have had more to do with his problem, if not at first, surely before the matter came to public trial ... So promising an idea as is the use of the confessional in framing a murder case and respectful as the picture appears to be of matters ecclesiastic, the basic conception is false. The result is a tricked-up picture unworthy of the suave master of movie thrillers.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Coe |first=Richard L. |date=February 27, 1953 |title=The Warner Offers Hitchcock's Latest |newspaper=The Washington Post |page=36 }}</ref> [[John McCarten]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' was also negative, writing: \"Presumably, this is meant to be a kind of mystery drama. What it actually amounts to, though, is an exposition of the difficulties a priest can get into by keeping the secrets of the confessional inviolate. The theme is prinked up with murder and romance, but neither, as represented here, makes for suspense or entertainment ... it is possible that Montgomery Clift, who plays the part, was ill-advised to portray the priest as a sort of bemused juvenile, plainly too abstracted to lead one lamb, let alone a flock.\"<ref name=mccarten>{{cite magazine |last=McCarten |first=John |date=April 4, 1953 |title=The Current Cinema |magazine=The New Yorker |pages=82\u201383 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1953/04/04/1953-04-04-082-tny-cards-000039975 |access-date=October 17, 2022 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\nA mixed review in ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' declared the film \"rather less successful than ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' and a good deal more so than anything else Hitchcock has done since the ill-fated ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' ... The final chase through the huge Chateau Frontenac seems a touch that Hitchcock could not resist: out of keeping with the generally somber tone of the film, it provides a showily melodramatic climax. The unresolved split between the straightforward thriller technique and the more penetrating psychological study of character, indeed, makes itself felt as a weakness at intervals throughout the film.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=May 1953 |title=I Confess |journal=The Monthly Film Bulletin |volume=20 |issue=232 |page=67}}</ref> The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' also was mixed, declaring that \"While it has scenery and carefully allotted bits of tension, the film is crowded and devious plot-wise and doesn't rank with Director Hitchcock's previous bests.
