It is based on the experiences of BBC news producer [[David Belton]], who worked in Rwanda during the [[Rwandan genocide]]. Belton is the film's co-writer and one of its producers.\n\nThe setting of the film is the [[\u00c9cole Technique Officielle]] (ETO) in [[Kigali]], [[Rwanda]], in 1994, during the Rwandan genocide. Hurt plays a Catholic priest (loosely based on [[Vjekoslav \u0106uri\u0107]]<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/03/23/DDGGDOPE3R1.DTL San Francisco Chronicle, Amid genocide in Rwanda, one man stands tall]</ref>) and Dancy an English teacher, both Europeans, who are caught up in the events of the genocide.\n\nUnlike ''[[Hotel Rwanda]]'', which was filmed in [[South Africa]] using South African actors, the film was shot in the original location of the scenes it portrays. Also, many of the massacre survivors were employed as part of the production crew and in minor acting roles.\n\nThe film's title refers to the actions of [[United Nations|UN]] soldiers in shooting at the stray dogs that [[scavenger|scavenged]] the bodies of the dead. Since the UN soldiers were not allowed to shoot at the Hutu extremists who had caused the deaths in the first place, the shooting of dogs is symbolic of the madness of the situation that the film attempts to capture.\n\n==Plot==\n\nJoe Connor is a teacher at the [[\u00c9cole Technique Officielle]] outside [[Kigali]], run by Father Christopher. The school is also home to a company of Belgian soldiers under the command of Captain Delon, as part of the UN peacekeeping mandate. Joe is close to a girl, Marie, who Christopher believes has a crush on him. In early April 1994, they observe a number of events that cause Christopher some concern, including lists being made of Tutsi families, reports of Hutu mobs attacking Tutsis elsewhere in the country, and a suspicious interest shown by Christopher's government contact in the number of UN troops at the school.\n\nOn the night of 6 April 1994, distant explosions and gunshots are heard, and Delon hears that the [[Assassination of Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|President's plane has been shot down]]. He mobilises his men to guard the school perimeter, turning it into a military base. Refugees arrive at the gates, and Christopher, over Delon's objections, insists that they are let in. The next morning, Joe drives to Marie's house to fetch her, but the house is deserted save for a dog. He returns to the school to find that she has arrived through the rear entrance, as the front entrance is now guarded by a Hutu mob. The refugees organise themselves under the leadership of Roland, Marie's father. A number of European refugees also arrive, and, to Christopher's frustration, Delon arranges for them to be given better quarters. Christopher continues with church services as usual, while Joe attempts to help the refugees.\n\nAs a mob surrounds the school, Joe thinks it would help the refugees if their plight is televised and requests Delon's assistance to fetch [[BBC]] journalist Rachel and bring her to the compound. Delon is initially cooperative, but abruptly changes his mind and refuses when he hears that the Belgian soldiers guarding Prime Minister [[Agathe Uwilingiyimana|Uwilingiyimana]] have been massacred. Joe decides to leave anyway and get his friend Fran\u00e7ois, who is a Hutu, to escort him instead, but Fran\u00e7ois is not at home. Joe finds Rachel and her cameraman and persuades them to come to the school by telling them there are Europeans there. As they are returning to the school they are stopped at a roadblock and dragged from their vehicle at gunpoint. While Rachel tries to negotiate their way out, Joe is distraught to see a Tutsi man dragged off and hacked to death with machetes. He is further horrified to see that Fran\u00e7ois is with the mob, holding a bloody machete. Fran\u00e7ois arranges for Joe and the BBC team to be let through. The journalists seem much more dispassionate about the events than Joe, which he later discusses with Rachel, who is a veteran reporter with experience of similar events [[Ethnic cleansing in the Bosnian War|in Bosnia]].\n\nDuring an interview with Delon, Rachel asks him why his troops do not intervene to stop the killings and queries the UN mandate. Delon terminates the interview and tells her that he has requested a change to his mandate to allow him to intervene, without success. Christopher delivers the baby of Edda, one of the refugees, who names the baby after him. Christopher later leaves the school to find medicine for the baby and to visit a nearby convent, which he has heard has been attacked. At the pharmacist, he pays a bribe to get the medicine and angrily lies that the child is Hutu. When he arrives at the convent, he finds that the nuns have all been killed. Outside, the school's hurdles which he lent out as a favour are being used as part of the roadblock, something his government contact gleefully points out. On Christopher's return to the school, Delon tells him they will begin shooting the dogs scavenging nearby bodies. Christopher sarcastically asks if the dogs have been shooting at the UN troops, in reference to their limited mandate.\n\nFrench troops arrive at the base but announce they are only there to take French refugees. After a furious outburst from Delon, they agree to take all the Europeans. Joe attempts to negotiate for Marie to take his place on the trucks but is rebuffed. Rachel leaves with the French, telling Joe he should leave too. A group of refugees, including Edda, try to escape through the rear of the school but are ambushed by a mob. Most of them are killed, but a few make it back to the safety of the compound. Edda initially avoids them by hiding, but her baby begins crying, alerting the killers to her presence. As Joe watches, she and her baby are hacked to death.\n\nDelon eventually receives orders to withdraw from the school. While the Belgians are preparing to leave, Roland begs Delon to shoot the refugees, to spare them murder by machete, but Delon refuses. Joe decides he cannot bear it anymore and leaves with Delon. He encounters Marie as he is boarding the truck and cannot say anything but \"I'm sorry\". Christopher elects to stay behind, before realising he can smuggle children out in the back of the school truck. He takes a small group of children, including Marie, intending to return for more, but as soon as he leaves the school, the mob attacks and massacres the remaining refugees.\n\nChristopher is stopped at a roadblock, which is led by his friend Julius. Despite Christopher's attempts to talk his way through and appeal to their relationship, Julius is openly hostile. When Christopher refuses to cooperate, Julius fatally shoots him. Marie, observing their conversation and fearing that the truck will be searched, meanwhile manages to slip away unnoticed with the children. Christopher sees Marie escape before dying.\n\nFootage of Marie running is intercut with interview footage over the UN's reluctance to term the events in Rwanda a \"genocide\". In a brief epilogue, Marie tracks down Joe, who is now a teacher at Christopher's old school, and they briefly discuss their experiences.\n\nThe film closes with information about the genocide in Rwanda and the killings at the ETO in particular, with details of the personal experiences of some of the film crew during the genocide.\n\n==Cast (credited)==\n* [[John Hurt]] as Father Christopher\n* [[Hugh Dancy]] as Joe Connor\n* [[Dominique Horwitz]] as Capitaine Charles Delon\n* [[Louis Mahoney]] as Sibomana\n* [[Nicola Walker]] as Rachel\n* [[Steve Toussaint]] as Roland\n* [[David Gyasi]] as Fran\u00e7ois\n* [[Susan Nalwoga]] as Edda\n* [[Victor Power (actor)|Victor Power]] as Julius\n* [[Jack Pierce (actor)|Jack Pierce]] as Mark\n* [[Musa Kasonka Jr.]] as Boniface\n* [[Kizito Ssentamu Kayiira]] as Pierre\n* [[Clare-Hope Ashitey]] as Marie\n\n==Crew==\n* Director &ndash; [[Michael Caton-Jones]]\n* Writers &ndash; [[David Wolstencroft]] (screenplay), [[Richard Alwyn]] (story), [[David Belton]] (story)\n* Original Music &ndash; [[Dario Marianelli]]\n* Cinematography &ndash; [[Ivan Strasburg]]\n* Editing &ndash; [[Christian Lonk]]\n* Casting &ndash; [[Anja Dihrberg]], [[Karen Lindsay-Stewart]]\n* Production Design &ndash; [[Bertram Strau\u00df]]\n* Art Direction &ndash; [[Astrid Sieben]]\n* Set Decoration &ndash; [[Dagmar Wessel]]\n* Costume Design &ndash; [[Dinah Collin]]\n\n==Critical response==\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports an approval rating of 84% based on 63 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10.
