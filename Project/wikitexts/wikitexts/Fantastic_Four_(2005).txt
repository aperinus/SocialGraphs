It was directed by [[Tim Story]], and released by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film stars [[Ioan Gruffudd]], [[Jessica Alba]], [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Michael Chiklis]], [[Julian McMahon]] and [[Kerry Washington]].\n\nThis was the second live-action ''Fantastic Four'' film to be filmed. A previous attempt, titled ''[[The Fantastic Four (unreleased film)|The Fantastic Four]]'', was a [[B-movie]] produced by [[Roger Corman]] that ultimately went unreleased. ''Fantastic Four'' was released in the United States on July 8, 2005. Despite receiving generally negative reviews from critics, it grossed over $333 million worldwide and was a box office success. A sequel, ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'', was released in 2007. [[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|A reboot]] was released in 2015.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Mister Fantastic|Dr. Reed Richards]], a bankrupt [[physicist]], is convinced [[evolution]] was triggered millions of years ago on earth by clouds of cosmic energy in space, and has calculated that one of these clouds is soon going to pass near Earth. Together with his friend, [[astronaut]] [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], Reed convinces [[Doctor Doom|Dr. Victor Von Doom]], CEO of Von Doom Industries, to allow him access to his [[space station]] to test the effects of exposure to the cloud on biological samples. Von Doom agrees, in exchange for control over the experiment and a majority of the profits from whatever benefits it brings. He brings aboard his chief genetics researcher (and Reed's ex-girlfriend) [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]] and her reckless brother [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], a young astronaut.\n\nThe quintet travels to space to observe the cosmic energy clouds, but Reed has miscalculated and the clouds materialize well ahead of schedule. Reed, Susan, and Johnny leave the shielded station to rescue Ben who has gone on a space-walk to place the samples, and Victor closes the shield behind them. Ben receives full exposure out in space, while the others receive a more limited dose. They return home but soon begin to develop strange powers. Reed is able to stretch like rubber; Susan can become invisible and create force fields, especially when angered; Johnny can engulf himself in fire and is able to fly; and Ben is transformed into a large, rock-based creature with superhuman strength and durability. Victor meanwhile faces a backlash from his stockholders due to the publicity from the failed mission.\n\nBen returns home to see his fianc\u00e9e Debbie, but she cannot handle his new appearance and flees in fear. He goes to brood on [[Brooklyn Bridge]] and accidentally causes a traffic pile-up while stopping a man from committing suicide. The four use their various powers to contain the damage and prevent anyone from being hurt. While the public cheer them for their efforts, Ben sees his fianc\u00e9e leave her engagement ring on the ground and run. Reed hands a heartbroken Ben the ring and vows to find a way to turn him back to normal. The media dubs them \"The Fantastic Four\" for their efforts. Victor watches the news story and is told that his company is lost now. The four move into Reed's lab in the [[Baxter Building]] to study their abilities. Victor offers his support in their efforts but blames Reed for the mission's failure, the lights flickering as he grows enraged.\n\nReed tells the group he will construct a machine to re-create the storm and reverse its effect on their bodies, but warns it could possibly accelerate them instead. However,  Johnny refuses to give up his powers and uses them to help him win extreme sports thus exposing Reed, Susan, and Ben's abilities to the public which leads to a small fight between him and Ben. Meanwhile, Victor continues to mutate, his arm turning into an organic metal and allowing him to produce bolts of electricity, and he begins plotting to use his new powers to take his revenge. Victor drives a wedge between Ben and Reed, resulting in Ben walking out in a rage. Susan soon scolds Johnny on how he is using his powers just to gain popularity. This motivates Reed to attempt the machine on himself, but he cannot generate the power needed to push the storm to critical mass. Victor hears Reed tell Susan this and has Ben brought to the lab. Ben is placed in the machine and Doom uses his abilities to produce the electricity needed to power it, turning Ben back to normal and accelerating Doom's condition, causing much of his body to turn to metal. Victor knocks Ben unconscious and kidnaps Reed.\n\nVictor \u2013 now calling himself \"[[Doctor Doom|Doom]]\" \u2013 dons a metal mask to hide his physical deformities and tortures Reed using a super-cooling unit. Doom fires a heat-seeking missile at the Baxter Building to kill Johnny, and Johnny flies through the city to evade it, lighting a garbage barge on fire to trick it. Susan rushes to confront Doom as Ben begins to regret his decision to turn normal. Susan frees Reed and battles Doom but is outmatched - Ben arrives to save her, transformed into The Thing again by reusing the machine. The battle spills into the streets, and the four assemble to battle Doom. Johnny and Susan combine their powers to wrap Doom in an inferno of intense heat, and Ben and Reed douse him with cold water, inducing [[thermal shock]] and freezing Doom in place.\n\nAs an [[epilogue]], Ben informs Reed that he has accepted his condition with the help of [[Alicia Masters]], a blind [[artist]] for whom he has developed feelings, and the team decide to embrace their roles as superheroes and unite officially as the Fantastic Four. Reed proposes to Susan, who accepts and they share a kiss. Meanwhile, Doom's statuesque remains are being transported back to his homeland of [[Latveria]] when the dockmaster's electronic manifest briefly experiences electronic interference.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ioan Gruffudd]] as [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards / Mr. Fantastic]]\n* [[Jessica Alba]] as [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm / Invisible Woman]]\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm / Human Torch]]\n* [[Michael Chiklis]] as [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm / Thing]]\n* [[Julian McMahon]] as [[Doctor Doom|Victor Von Doom / Doctor Doom]]\n* [[Hamish Linklater]] as Leonard\n* [[Kerry Washington]] as [[Alicia Masters]]\n* [[Laurie Holden]] as Debbie McIlvane\n* [[Kevin McNulty (actor)|Kevin McNulty]] as Jimmy O'Hoolihan\n* [[Maria Menounos]] as Nurse\n* [[Michael Kopsa]] as Ned Cecil\n* [[Stan Lee]] as [[Willie Lumpkin]]\n\nAs in almost all of the previous Marvel Comics-based films, ''Fantastic Four'' co-creator Stan Lee makes a [[cameo appearance]].

This version had some changes from the one shown in cinemas. Some of these changes included the following:\n* There is a scene where Reed and Susan are in a storage room of the Baxter Building. On one of the shelves is a robot that is supposed to be [[H.E.R.B.I.E.]] from the [[Fantastic Four (1978 TV series)|''Fantastic Four'' animated cartoon series from 1978]].\n* The biggest change is of the scene with Jessica Alba and Ioan Gruffudd's characters looking toward the [[Statue of Liberty]]. Similar lines are used in the DVD version, but the version on DVD replaces that with the pair in the [[planetarium]], where they discuss their feelings for each other without an argumentative tone. The DVD includes the theatrical version as a bonus feature, but instead of Reed forming a square jaw, as he does in the theatrical version, he makes his skin look like that of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] of the [[X-Men]] [[comics]]. The actor Gruffudd breaks the [[fourth wall]] and looks directly at the camera as he does this. This scene was created in hopes to create a cinematic universe between This film, Fox's X-Men and Sony's Spider-Man. Wolverine was also set to appear in a cameo in Spider-Man 2. The extended cut includes this as part of the movie, along with a longer version of the scene in the [[planetarium]].<ref name=\"extended\"/>\n\nThe movie was also released on [[VHS]] the same day, it was later released on [[Blu-ray]] on November 14, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fantastic Four Blu-ray review |url=https://bluray.highdefdigest.com/205/fantasticfour.html |website=HighDefDigest.com |date=November 13, 2006 |access-date=December 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Extended cut===\nIn June 2007, an extended cut DVD of ''Fantastic Four'' was released.
