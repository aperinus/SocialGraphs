It also features [[Cedric Hardwicke|Sir Cedric Hardwicke]], [[Nigel Bruce]], [[May Whitty|Dame May Whitty]], [[Isabel Jeans]], [[Heather Angel (actor)|Heather Angel]], and [[Leo G. Carroll]]. ''Suspicion'' is based on [[Francis Iles]]'s novel ''[[Before the Fact]]'' (1932).\n\nFor her role as Lina, Joan Fontaine won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] in 1941. This is the only [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning performance in a Hitchcock film.\n\nIn the film, a romantically inexperienced woman marries a charming playboy after initially rejecting him. He turns out to be penniless, a gambler, and dishonest in the extreme. She comes to suspect that he is also a murderer, and that he is attempting to kill her.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1938, handsome, irresponsible playboy Johnnie Aysgarth ([[Cary Grant]]) meets bespectacled Lina McLaidlaw ([[Joan Fontaine]]) on a train in England and later persuades her to take a walk with him. She is defensive and suspects his motives; he insults her in a ploy to create familiarity. But later, at a window, she overhears her parents talking about her. They assume she will never marry, and hurt by this she kisses Johnnie.\n\nShe hopes to hear from him but he cancels their afternoon date and then vanishes. However, he returns for a hunt ball a week later and charms her into eventually [[elope|eloping]] despite the strong disapproval of her wealthy father, General McLaidlaw ([[Cedric Hardwicke|Sir Cedric Hardwicke]]). After a lavish honeymoon and returning to an extravagant house, Lina discovers that Johnnie has no job and no income, habitually lives on borrowed money, and was intending to try to sponge off her father. She talks him into getting a job, and he goes to work for his cousin, estate agent Captain Melbeck ([[Leo G. Carroll]]).\n\nGradually, Lina learns that Johnnie has continued to gamble wildly, despite promising to quit, and that to pay a gambling debt, he sold two antique chairs (family heirlooms) that her father had given her as a wedding present. Beaky ([[Nigel Bruce]]), Johnnie's good-natured but naive friend, tries to reassure Lina that her husband is a lot of fun and a highly entertaining liar. She repeatedly catches Johnnie in ever more significant lies, discovering that he was fired weeks before for [[Embezzlement|embezzling]] from Melbeck, who says he will not prosecute if the money is repaid.\n\nLina writes a letter to Johnnie that she is leaving him, but then tears it up. After this, Johnnie enters the room and shows her a telegram announcing her father's death. Johnnie is severely disappointed to discover that Lina has inherited no money, only her father's portrait. He convinces Beaky to finance a hugely speculative land development scheme. Lina is afraid this is a [[confidence trick]] or worse, and futilely tries to talk Beaky out of it. Johnnie overhears and angrily warns his wife to stay out of his affairs, but later he calls the whole thing off.\n\nWhen Beaky leaves for [[Paris]], Johnnie accompanies him partway. Later, news reaches Lina that Beaky died in Paris. Johnnie lies to her and an investigating police inspector, saying that he (Johnnie) stayed in [[London]]. This and other details lead Lina to suspect he was responsible for Beaky's death.\n\nLina then begins to fear that her husband is plotting to kill her for her [[life insurance]]. He has been questioning her friend Isobel Sedbusk ([[Auriol Lee]]), a writer of mystery novels, about untraceable poisons. Johnnie brings Lina a glass of milk before bed, but she is too afraid to drink it. Needing to get away for a while, she says she will stay with her mother for a few days. Johnnie insists on driving her there. He speeds recklessly in a powerful convertible on a dangerous road beside a cliff. Lina's door unexpectedly swings open. Johnnie reaches over, his intent unclear to the terrified woman. When she shrinks from him, he stops the car.\n\nIn the subsequent confrontation, Johnnie asserts that he was actually intending to commit [[suicide]] after taking Lina to her mother's. At this time he states that he has decided that suicide is the coward's way out, and is resolved to face his responsibilities, even to the point of going to prison for the embezzlement. He reveals being in [[Liverpool]] at the time of Beaky's death, trying to borrow on Lina's life insurance policy to repay Melbeck. Her suspicions allayed, Lina asks him to go home and see it all through together. Johnnie initially refuses but eventually they drive away together.\n<!-- Regarding this claim: \"However, none of Johnnie's claims in the final scene are independently substantiated, and he has consistently lied to Lina up until this point; thus the film ends with an air of disconcerting ambiguity.\"{{fact}} // This is Original Research, as it is not explicitly in the film itself (regardless of whether the novel is supposed to end this way), **unless** you can find a secondary source interpretation (published book, journal article, news article, or magazine article) which supports this interpretation!-->\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Joan Fontaine and Gary Cooper.jpg|thumb|right|[[Joan Fontaine]] and [[Gary Cooper]] holding their Oscars at [[Academy Award]]s, 1942.

In ''Suspicion'', he can be seen very briefly approximately 47 minutes into the film mailing a letter at the village postbox.\n\n==The West-Ingster screenplay==\nIn November 1939, [[Nathanael West]] was hired as a screenwriter by [[RKO Radio Pictures]], where he collaborated with Boris Ingster on a film adaptation of the novel. The two men wrote the screenplay in seven weeks, with West focusing on characterization and dialogue as Ingster worked on the narrative structure.\n\nWhen RKO assigned ''Before the Fact'' to Hitchcock, he already had his own, substantially different, screenplay, credited to [[Samson Raphaelson]], [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], and [[Alma Reville]]. (Harrison was Hitchcock's personal assistant, and Reville was Hitchcock's wife.) West and Ingster's screenplay was abandoned and never produced. The text of this screenplay can be found in the [[Library of America]]'s edition of West's collected works.\n\n== Production ==\n===Development===\n[[File:Joan Fontaine in Suspicion trailer.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Johnnie and Lina in the film.]]\n''Suspicion'' illustrates how a novel's plot can be so much altered in the transition to film as to reverse the author's original intention. As [[William L. DeAndrea|William L. De Andrea]] states in his ''Encyclopedia Mysteriosa'' (1994) that ''Suspicion''<blockquote>was supposed to be the study of a murder as seen through the eyes of the eventual victim. However, because Cary Grant was to be the killer and Joan Fontaine the person killed, the studio \u2014 RKO \u2014 decreed a different ending, which Hitchcock supplied and then spent the rest of his life complaining about.<ref name=\"book\">{{cite book | last = Spoto | first = Donald | title = The Dark Side of Genius: The Life of Alfred Hitchcock | publisher = Da Capo | year = 1999 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/darksideofgenius00spot_0/page/243 242\u2013244] | isbn = 0-306-80932-X | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/darksideofgenius00spot_0/page/243 }}</ref></blockquote>  Hitchcock was quoted as saying that he was forced to alter the ending of the movie.<ref name=\"book\" /> He wanted an ending similar to the climax of the novel, but the studio, more concerned with Cary Grant's \"heroic\" image, insisted that it be changed. In his biography of Hitchcock, ''The Dark Side of Genius'', [[Donald Spoto]] disputes Hitchcock's claim to have been overruled on the film's ending.  Spoto claims that the first RKO treatment and memos between Hitchcock and the studio show that Hitchcock emphatically desired to make a film about a woman's fantasy life.<ref name=\"book\"/>\n\nAs in the novel, General McLaidlaw opposes his daughter's marriage to Johnnie Aysgarth. In both versions, Johnnie freely admits that he would not mind the general's death because he expects Lina to inherit a substantial fortune, which would solve their financial problems. The book, however, is much darker, with Johnnie egging on the general to exert himself to the point where he collapses and dies. In the film, General McLaidlaw's death is only reported, and Johnnie is not involved at all. Again, Johnnie's criminal record remains incomplete.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}<!--Some of these indeed are in the film, but we need secondary sources to prove that the implications/interpretations are encyclopedic-->\n\nSeveral scenes in the film create suspense and sow doubt as to Johnnie's intentions: Beaky's death in Paris is due to an allergy to brandy, which Johnnie knew about. A waiter who barely speaks English tells the police that Beaky addressed his companion that night as \"Old Bean\", the way Beaky addressed Johnnie. At the end of the film, Johnnie is driving his wife at breakneck speed to her mother's house. This scene, which takes place after her final illness, is not in the book.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe biggest difference is the ending. In Iles' novel, Johnnie serves his sick wife a drink which she knows to be poisoned, and she voluntarily gulps it down. In the film, the drink may or may not be poisoned and can be seen untouched the following morning. Another ending was considered but not used, in which Lina is writing a letter to her mother stating that she fears Johnnie is going to poison her, at which point he walks in with the milk. She finishes the letter, seals and stamps an envelope, asks Johnnie to mail the letter, then drinks the milk. The final shot would have shown him leaving the house and dropping into a mailbox the letter which incriminates him. Hitchcock's recollection of this original ending\u2014in his book-length interview with [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], published in English as ''Hitchcock/Truffaut'' in 1967\u2014is that Lina's letter tells her mother she knows that Johnnie is killing her, but that she loves him too much to care.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nA musical [[leitmotif]] is introduced in ''Suspicion''. Whenever Lina is happy with Johnnie \u2014 starting with a ball organised by General McLaidlaw \u2014 [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss]]'s waltz \"[[Wiener Blut (waltz)|Wiener Blut]]\" is played in its original, light-hearted version. At one point, when she is suspicious of her husband, a threatening, minor-key version of the waltz is employed, metamorphosing into the full and happy version after the suspense has been lifted. At another, Johnnie is whistling the waltz. At yet another, while Johnnie is serving the drink of milk, a sad version of \"Wiener Blut\" is played again. By placing a lightbulb in the milk, the filmmakers made the contents appear to glow as the glass is carried upstairs by Johnnie, further enhancing the audience's fear that it is poisoned.\n\nA visual threat is inserted when Lina suspects her husband of preparing to kill Beaky: On the night before, at the Aysgarths' home, they play [[Anagrams (game)|Anagrams]], and suddenly, by exchanging a letter, Lina changes \"mudder\" into \"murder\" and then  \"murderer.\" Seeing the word, Lina looks at the flyer showing the cliffs Johnnie and Beaky plan to inspect for a real estate venture the next morning. The silhouettes of two men appear in the photograph. One pushes the other over the cliff, and we see Beaky falling and screaming. Lina faints.\n\nIf the viewer accepts Johnnie's statements in the final scene and decides that he is, for all his faults, no murderer, the film becomes a cautionary tale about the dangers of suspicion based only on assumed, incomplete, and circumstantial evidence. However, given his behaviour up to this point, it is not clear why Johnnie's assertions should be readily believed; in effect, the film leaves the viewer in a perpetual state of suspense as to what the truth is and what might happen next.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Casting===\nOriginally, the story was intended as a [[B pictures|B picture]] to star [[George Sanders]] and [[Anne Shirley (actress)|Anne Shirley]]. Then when Alfred Hitchcock became involved, the budget increased and [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Frances Dee]] were to star. Eventually, it was decided to cast Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine. Fontaine had to be borrowed from David O.
