He makes the team after blowing away the scouts with his 'rocket' arm as well as having a strong training camp. Deuce also befriends a chimpanzee, 'Ed,'  after being told the chimp is his new roommate/teammate. After they move into their apartment, Deuce develops a relationship with his neighbor, Lydia. Also, Ed becomes very close with her daughter, Elizabeth. Deuce's game really begins to take off as well as Ed's and the team becomes a league contender. Deuce's coach, Chubb, thinks Deuce can be an [[MLB]] starter if he keeps his head on straight. But after the owners sell Ed to make a buck, Deuce takes matters into his own hands and goes to find Ed only to see him being tortured by a pair of goons. Deuce saves Ed but Ed escapes and finds a truck of Frosted Bananas and doesn't realize he is stuck inside the trailer, which is ice cold. Ed ends up in the hospital from almost freezing to death before the final game of the season and Deuce questions his own ability to continue playing without his best friend. Deuce ends up playing and struggles right off the bat. But when Ed, Elizabeth and Lydia arrive at the game together, Deuce turns up the heat and the Rockets take the championship. Deuce eventually gets called up to the Dodgers. In the end, Ed, Deuce, Lydia and Elizabeth then become a family and live happily ever after.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matt LeBlanc]] as Jack \"Deuce\" Cooper\n* Jay Caputo and Denise Cheshire as Ed\n* [[Jayne Brook]] as Lydia\n* Doren Fein as Liz\n* [[Jack Warden]] as Chubb\n* [[Bill Cobbs]] as Tipton\n* [[Jim Caviezel]] as Dizzy\n* [[Jim O'Heir]] as Art\n* [[Steve Eastin]] as Shark's Manager \n* [[Brad Hunt (actor)|Brad Hunt]] as Carnie\n* Sage Allen as Cooper's Mother\n* [[Stan Ivar]]\tas Cooper's Father\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was a [[box-office bomb|box office disappointment]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}}\n{{RT data|prose|ref=yes}}\nIt received four [[Golden Raspberry Award|Razzie Award]] nominations for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]], [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screenplay|Worst Screenplay]] ([[David M.
