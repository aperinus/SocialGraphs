An unseen [[Studio audience|live audience]] applauds as Peter directs their gaze toward the movie of his life.\n\nIn 1950s [[London]], Peter Sellers is a household name as a performer on ''[[The Goon Show]]'' but is failing to branch out into film. He returns home to his family after a failed audition but is urged by his controlling mother Peg ([[Miriam Margolyes]]) to \"bite the hand that feeds you\". A now inspired Peter utilizes his talent for impersonation to disguise himself as the elderly war veteran character he was auditioning for. Once the casting agent ([[Alison Steadman]]) has divulged that he is perfect for the role, Peter reveals himself and is reluctantly given the part.\n\nPeter wins a [[British Academy Film Awards|British Academy Award]] for ''[[I'm All Right Jack]]''. Peg and Peter's father, Bill ([[Peter Vaughan]]), watch their son's acceptance speech but dismissed by Peg, a dejected Bill walks away leading to the first transformation of the film; Peter is now playing his father, and with a heavy Yorkshire accent breaks [[Fourth wall|the fourth wall]] to tell us about Peter's childhood.\n\nBefore the shooting of ''[[The Millionairess]]'' has begun, Peter is already besotted with his co-star [[Sophia Loren]] ([[Sonia Aquino]]), while his marriage to wife Anne ([[Emily Watson]]) is becoming strained and his children are subjected to their father's rages and subsequent extravagant gifts as compensation. When Sophia mentions that Peter is too far away in the countryside to take her home, he takes this as a cue to buy a house in the heart of London. To subdue some of the guilt Peter feels about his feelings for Sophia, he hires a decorator, Ted Levy, and insists that his wife and Ted should have drinks together. Peter leaves them and goes to have dinner alone with Sophia, who is surprised that Peter's wife is not joining them and slowly realises that this is a date. She rejects Peter's advances and tells him to go home to his family. Peter does so and announces his love for Sophia Loren to Anne and their two children.\n\nSeeing [[Carlo Ponti]] ([[Joseph Long (actor)|Joseph Long]]) has come to visit his wife Sophia on set, Sellers distracts himself with Sophia's stand-in and the two have sex in Peter's [[Rolls-Royce Motors|Rolls-Royce]]. Meanwhile, a weary Anne surrenders to quietly spending the night with Ted. Once Peter returns home and realises his wife has left, he wreaks havoc in the house. Anne comes home the morning after to find Peter on the balcony threatening to jump if she leaves. The two argue and Anne walks out. We then see Peter's second transformation, this time in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] as Anne, who is [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] the breakup to make it look as though they had reconciled.\n\nPeter returns home to Peg's care to recuperate after the divorce and begins to see [[Maurice Woodruff]] ([[Stephen Fry]]), a [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] to the stars, hoping to gain some direction; Woodruff's influence leads him to the Pink Panther series.\n\nOn a flight to Italy, he sees a pack of [[Matthew Webb|Captain Webb]] [[match]]es, which inspires the physical appearance of [[Inspector Clouseau]]. Filming of ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]'' begins and his portrayal is a huge success, but Peter is disappointed with the final product and blames [[Blake Edwards]] ([[John Lithgow]]).\n\nPeter returns to England to find his father on [[life support]], which Peg had been keeping from him. After Bill has stated how proud he is of his son, he dies. Peter is heartbroken and cannot forgive Peg for not calling him; their close bond is irreversibly severed and Peter leaves.\n\nAt [[The Dorchester|The Dorchester Hotel]], Peter is taking a woman back to his room but is interrupted by [[Stanley Kubrick]] ([[Stanley Tucci]]), who has come to persuade Peter to be in his new film, ''[[Dr. Strangelove]].'' Peg comes to visit Peter on-set, but Peter decides to stay in character as the [[Dr. Strangelove#Dr. Strangelove|titular scientist]] to avoid confronting reality. Peg is unsettled and eventually leaves, feeling as though she had not truly seen her son.\n\nWhile Stanley and Peter are discussing the fourth character he is due to play, Peter grows aggravated about his workload, insisting he will not play the [[Dr. Strangelove#Slim Pickens as Major T. J. \"King\" Kong|American bomber pilot]]. After he storms off, we watch the third change; Peter becomes Stanley, who turns to look at us with the [[wiktionary:Kubrick stare|Kubrick stare]] and tells us that Peter Sellers was not a person, simply a vessel, \u201cbut even an empty vessel can become too full\u201d. Peter's way out of playing Major Kong is by showing up to set with [[crutch]]es and pretending he had injured himself getting out of a taxi.\n\nMeanwhile, Maurice Woodruff is taking a bribe to convince Peter into doing another Pink Panther film. He informs Peter that a very special partnership involves the initials B.E., meaning Blake Edwards. Peter instead pursues his new neighbour [[Britt Ekland]] ([[Charlize Theron]]). He asks her to be his date to the cinema where they see Dr Strangelove. They wed just 10 days after meeting.[[Image:Transformations_in_The_Life_and_Death_of_Peter_Sellers.jpg|thumb|262x262px|A few of the scenes where Geoffrey Rush as Peter plays other roles, a core storytelling device in the film.]]While on their honeymoon in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], Peter inhales [[Poppers|amyl nitrites]] during sex, causing him to have a series of eight [[Myocardial infarction|heart attacks]]. He is rushed to the hospital and Peg watches the [[breaking news]] of Peter's critical condition from her home in England being broadcast on \u201cboth channels\u201d. During the resuscitation, a [[dream sequence]] takes place in Peter's consciousness with his many characters surrounding him, before he notices that he has a ticking bomb attached to his chest. When he wakes, he believes himself to now be invincible.\nPeter's next film is ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'', but with his new lease of life he wants to play it straight, much to the dismay of everyone involved. He abandons the film after no one takes him seriously.\n\nBritt informs Peter that she has fallen pregnant, but is met with an unimpressed Peter, who doesn't want more children. However, Britt insists on keeping the baby. Once the baby is born, Peter and Britt's relationship becomes strained and they fight as the newborn interrupts scenes of ''[[After the Fox|After The Fox]].''\n\nIn costume as the blue matador for ''[[The Bobo]],'' Peter receives a call from Peg, where she tells Peter that she is in hospital and that she needs to see him. However, Peter pretends to be called away and hangs up. The fourth narrative change is Peter becoming Peg, who defends Peter's behaviour, just as the real Peg always did. As Peg, he climbs into a coffin before reverting to himself. Peter is distraught at Peg's funeral and Britt tries to comfort him, but he instead cries on his first wife Anne's shoulder.\n\nWhen they get home, Peter antagonizes Britt while she is trying to comfort him. A physical fight ensues and Britt smashes a picture of Peg over Peter's head. She leaves for good, taking their daughter with her, and Peter is alone with his thoughts, triggering a psychedelic sequence which swiftly takes Peter through the 70's.\n\nDuring one of their sessions, Maurice Woodruff listens to Peter talk about his obsession with ''[[Being There (novel)|Being There]],'' a book Peter loves so much that he wants it to be his next film, but Maurice [[Mediumship|uses the spirit of Peg]] to persuade Peter to instead do ''[[The Pink Panther Strikes Again]]'' and a superstitious Peter relents.\n\nAt the screening for the film, a drunken Peter gives a speech which becomes more and more uninhibited until he abruptly leaves. Watching his [[home movies]] alone, Peter gets a voicemail from his now adult son [[Michael Sellers (actor)|Michael]], who wishes him well with his new [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]]. Once the recording ends, Peter looks to the table beside him and opens the script for ''[[Revenge of the Pink Panther]].'' In costume as the \"old salty Swedish sea dog\", Peter collapses in his trailer while an unaware Blake bangs at his door. The fifth and final transformation is Peter into Blake Edwards, who tells us what it is like to work with the \"difficult\" but \"mesmerizing\" Peter Sellers.\n\nThe only project Peter never gave up on was ''[[Being There]]''. Scenes of Peter carefully constructing the main character in his home are interspersed with him destroying his own memorabilia, including some of his own home movies. Peter is exasperated that he can not find the look of Chance, but meditates on the memory of his lowly father. This allows Peter to not rely on a comical accent or costume, but to instead channel his still and simple father.\n\nPeter quietly rewatches scenes from ''Being There'', proud of something he made. A tired and visibly prematurely ageing Peter walks through the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] snow to meet with Blake Edwards, who has the script for ''The Romance of the Pink Panther''. Instead of entering, Peter hesitates and watches through the window, eventually turning to stand motionless under a streetlight. Blake comes out, confused to find Peter standing perfectly still. They do not share a word and Blake kisses Peter on the cheek, eventually leaving him alone. Facts about the final years of Sellers' life are shown over the motionless Peter in the snow.\n\nThe film finishes with the same version of Peter that we saw at the start. The movie about his life has now ended. He sits in the director's chair and shrugs, stands up and walks through the film's set pieces, surrounded by bustling [[Film crew|crew]], to his trailer and smiles to the camera, \"You can't come in here.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as [[Peter Sellers]]\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as [[Britt Ekland]]\n* [[Emily Watson]] as Anne Sellers\n* [[John Lithgow]] as [[Blake Edwards]]\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Peg Sellers\n* [[Peter Vaughan]] as Bill Sellers\n* [[Sonia Aquino]] as [[Sophia Loren]]\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as [[Stanley Kubrick]]\n* [[Stephen Fry]] as [[Maurice Woodruff]]\n* [[Henry Goodman]] as Dennis Selinger\n* [[Alison Steadman]] as the Casting Agent\n* [[Edward Tudor-Pole]] as [[Spike Milligan]]\n* [[Steve Pemberton]] as [[Harry Secombe]]\n* [[Nigel Havers]] as [[David Niven]]\n* [[Mackenzie Crook]] as a Car Salesman\n* [[Lance Ellington]] as [[Ray Ellington]]\n* [[Lucy Punch]] as a Stewardess\n* [[Heidi Klum]] as [[Ursula Andress]]\n* [[Joseph Long (actor)|Joseph Long]] as [[Carlo Ponti]]\n* [[Sam Dastor]] as [[Hal Ashby]]\n* [[Mona Hammond]] as [[Ruth Attaway|Ruth Attaway/Louise the Maid]]\n* Tope Oluwole as Beautiful Black Woman\n* [[Tom Wu]] as [[Burt Kwouk]]\n* [[Richard Ayoade]] as a Photographer at Wedding\n* [[Emilia Fox]] as [[Lynne Frederick]] (scenes deleted)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| perrow = 2\n| align = right\n| image1 = Peter Sellers at home Allan Warren.jpg\n| width1 = 220\n| image2 = Geoffrey Rush (6397243785).jpg\n| width2 = 163\n| footer = [[Peter Sellers]] and [[Geoffrey Rush]].\n| total_width = 350\n}}\nThe role of Sellers was portrayed by [[Geoffrey Rush]], \"who approached the role with the enthusiasm of a hungry child in a candy store\", notes a reviewer.<ref name=\"drax\">{{cite web|date=26 October 2005|title=Draxblog Movie Reviews: The Life and Death of Peter Sellers (2004)|url=http://draxreview.blogspot.com/2005/10/life-and-death-of-peter-sellers-2004.html|access-date=7 December 2012|publisher=DensityChecker}}</ref> Rush impersonates most of the important characters that Sellers played in his film career. Director [[Blake Edwards]] is played by [[John Lithgow]], and the film exposes some of the behind-the-scenes personality conflicts between Sellers and Edwards, which contributed to their unhappy and tumultuous working relationship, despite the success of their films. In the interview for the film, included on the DVD, Edwards credited Rush with portraying Sellers' characters with uncanny similarity to the real Peter Sellers, and in 2004 claimed that it was the best acting he had ever seen Rush perform.\n\nRush stated in interviews that the film was itself structured to be reminiscent of a Peter Sellers film. However, it was darker than Sellers' actual films since it depicted Sellers' troubled experiences in his life (including his tantrums and mental instability). This included at various times Rush (as Sellers) dressing up to play other characters in his life (several were ultimately edited out, but are included within the special features on the DVD).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Death-Peter-Sellers-Uncensored-extras/dp/B00360HH02/ref=sr_1_6?s=dvd&ie=UTF8&qid=1296310430&sr=1-6 |title=Life and death of Peter Sellers (2004) (import): Amazon.co.uk: Geoffrey Rush, Emily Watson, Peter Vaughan, Stephen Fry, Charlize Theron, Stephen Hopkins: Film & TV |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |access-date=7 December 2012}}</ref> In these instances he broke the [[fourth wall]] to give a monologue to the audience.\n\nRoger Lewis: \"It was the melancholia of Sellers I was drawn to; all those shuffling little ghostly figures he used to play in [[Boulting brothers]] films, or Clouseau, with those soulful, mournful brown eyes. For all the success and the women, he is rather a lonely and melancholic figure. And that is what redeems him.\" Hollywood was immediately interested in adapting Lewis's biography. In the mid-1990s [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s company Maverick bought the rights, but the Sellers project did not get off the ground. Many different writers worked on the screenplay, among them [[Lee Hall (playwright)|Lee Hall]]; eventually the writers [[Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely]] came up with a script to tell the story. Director Stephen Hopkins ultimately distanced himself from Lewis's book, and said he was inspired by Sellers's 16mm home movies, which were featured in a 1995 [[BBC]] ''[[Arena (UK TV series)|Arena]]'' documentary, \"The Peter Sellers Story\", directed by Peter Lydon.<ref>{{IMDb name|528001|Peter Lydon}}</ref><ref>Being Peter Sellers, ''[[The Independent]]'', 28 April 2004</ref>\n\n==Release==\nAlthough intended as a television production, the film was given a limited theatrical release in the United Kingdom and was also theatrically released in a number of other countries including Spain, Italy, Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia.<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/intl/?page=&id=_fTHELIFEANDDEATHO01 Box Office Mojo]</ref> The film achieved its highest theatrical success in Australia, earning over US$1 million at the box office.<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Life-and-Death-of-Peter-Sellers-The/Australia#tab=summary Australia Box Office for The Life and Death of Peter Sellers - The Numbers]</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 69% based on reviews from 26 critics.
