[[Yaphet Kotto]], [[John Ashton (actor)|John Ashton]], [[Dennis Farina]], [[Joe Pantoliano]], and [[Philip Baker Hall]] play supporting roles.\n\nAt the [[46th Golden Globe Awards]], the film was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor]] for De Niro. A critical and commercial success, the film was followed by ''[[The Midnight Run Action Pack]]'' in 1994, three [[Television film|made for television]] [[sequel]]s which did not feature any of the principal actors, although a few characters are carried over from the first film.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Bounty hunter]] Jack Walsh is enlisted by [[bail bondsman]] Eddie Moscone to bring accountant Jonathan \"The Duke\" Mardukas back to Los Angeles. The accountant had embezzled $15 million from Chicago mob boss Jimmy Serrano before skipping on the $450,000 bail Moscone had posted for him. Walsh must bring Mardukas back within five days, or Moscone defaults. Moscone says the job is easy, a \"midnight run,\" but Walsh demands $100,000. Walsh is then approached by FBI Agent Alonzo Mosely, who wants Mardukas to be a witness against Serrano and orders Walsh to keep away from Mardukas. Walsh takes no notice of this and instead steals Mosely's ID, which he uses to pass himself off as an FBI agent along his journey. Serrano\u2019s henchmen Tony and Joey offer Walsh $1 million to turn Mardukas over to them, but he turns them down.\n\nWalsh captures Mardukas in New York City and calls Moscone from the airport, not knowing that Moscone's line is tapped by the FBI and that his assistant Jerry is secretly tipping off Serrano's men. However, Mardukas fakes a panic attack on the plane, forcing the two men to travel via train. When Walsh and Mardukas fail to show up in Los Angeles on time, Moscone brings in rival bounty hunter Marvin Dorfler to find them. Dorfler tracks them to the train and attempts to take The Duke from Walsh, but Walsh gets the drop on him and leaves the train. However, he discovers when he attempts to purchase bus tickets with a credit card that Dorfler canceled the card.\n\nWithout funds, he is forced to rely on other means to get across the country, including stealing cars, borrowing his ex-wife\u2019s car in Chicago, and hitchhiking. Meanwhile, word of the skirmish on the train reaches Mosely's ears and he leads a task force to find Walsh and Mardukas.\n\nWalsh eventually reveals that, 10 years before, he was an undercover officer in Chicago trying to get close to a drug dealer who had almost the entire police force on his payroll. Eventually, just as Walsh was going to bust the dealer, he had heroin planted in his house by corrupt cops. In order to avoid either going to prison or working for the dealer, Walsh resigned from the force, left Chicago and became a bounty hunter, while his wife divorced him and married a corrupt lieutenant. Since then, however, Walsh has clung to the vain hope that he will one day be reunited with his ex-wife. Later, Mardukas learns that the drug dealer was Serrano.\n\nIn Arizona, Dorfler takes Mardukas away from Walsh, who is found by Mosely. While arguing with Moscone over the phone, Walsh realizes that Dorfler intends to turn Mardukas over to Serrano for $2 million. However, Dorfler accidentally reveals to Serrano's men where he is keeping Mardukas and is knocked unconscious by Serrano's men, who go after Mardukas themselves.\n\nWalsh calls Serrano's men and bluffs that he has computer disks created by Mardukas with enough information to put Serrano away, but promises to hand the disks over if Serrano returns Mardukas to him unharmed. He then makes a deal to deliver Serrano to the FBI in exchange for being allowed to take Mardukas back. Walsh meets up with Serrano while wearing a wire and being watched by the FBI. Dorfler spots Mardukas and interrupts the exchange, unknowingly disabling the wire. After Serrano takes the disks, the FBI closes in, arresting Serrano and his henchmen.\n\nMosely turns Mardukas over to Walsh with enough time to return him to Los Angeles by the deadline. However, Walsh realizes that he cannot bring himself to send Mardukas to prison, and lets him go. Before parting, Walsh gives Mardukas a watch that his wife gave him before their marriage, symbolizing he has finally let go of her. In return, Mardukas gives Walsh $300,000 in a money belt he had been hiding, clarifying that it is a gift (and not a bribe), as Walsh already let him go. Walsh flags down a taxi and asks the driver if he has change for a $1,000 bill, but the taxi drives away, so he heads home on foot.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Jack Walsh\n* [[Charles Grodin]] as Jonathan \"The Duke\" Mardukas\n* [[Yaphet Kotto]] as Special Agent Alonzo Mosely\n* [[John Ashton (actor)|John Ashton]] as Marvin Dorfler\n* [[Dennis Farina]] as Jimmy Serrano\n* [[Joe Pantoliano]] as Eddie Moscone\n* [[Richard Foronjy]] as Tony Darvo\n* [[Robert Miranda (actor)|Robert Miranda]] as Joey\n* [[Jack Kehoe]] as Jerry Geisler\n* [[Wendy Phillips]] as Gail\n* Danielle DuClos as Denise Walsh\n* [[Philip Baker Hall]] as Sidney\n* [[Tom McCleister]] as Bill \"Red\" Wood\n* [[Fran Brill]] as Dana Mardukas\n* [[Frank Pesce]] as Carmine\n}}\n\n==Production==\nAfter completing ''[[The Untouchables (1987 film)|The Untouchables]]'', De Niro wanted to try something different and decided on appearing in a comedy.<ref name= \"Parker, John\">{{cite news| last = Parker| first = John| title = De Niro| publisher = Victor Gollancz| date = 1995}}</ref> He pursued the lead role in [[Penny Marshall]]'s film, ''[[Big (film)|Big]]''.<ref name= \"Parker, John\" /> Marshall was interested, but the studio was not, so the role went to [[Tom Hanks]].

But Marty Brest! \"Herr Director\" shot so many takes of the scenes that I lost all joy in doing the film. It became hard and tedious work. Then he stopped eating during the shoot and became thinner and thinner each day, until he looked like a ghost behind the camera. When I met Marty at the Universal studio with De Niro, he looked healthy and strong, but as filming went on, he began to turn into someone you'd see in [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]. It was weird. I got sick and for the whole of the film I had a fever and was under the weather for most of it ... I was shocked when it came off so funny ...

Both men realize, despite their differences, that they share core beliefs of what is right and wrong. Audiences also think that the road trip angle to the story rings true. Everyone who has ever gone on a long road trip knows that things can go wrong and, as a result, adults can be reduced to behaving like children.
