It stars [[Jim Carrey]] as a lawyer who built his entire career on lying, but finds himself cursed to speak only the truth for a single day, during which he struggles to maintain his career and to reconcile with his former wife and son whom he alienated with his [[pathological lying]].\n\nThe film is the second of three collaborations between Carrey and Shadyac\u2014the first being ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'' and the third being ''[[Bruce Almighty]]''\u2014the second of three collaborations between Guay and Mazur\u2014the others being ''[[The Little Rascals (film)|The Little Rascals]]'' and ''[[Heartbreakers (2001 film)|Heartbreakers]]''\u2014and the first collaboration between Carrey and producer Brian Grazer.\n\n''Liar Liar'' was released to critical and commercial success, grossing $302.7 million against a budget of $45 million and earning positive reviews from critics and audiences, who particularly praised Carrey's performance. At the [[56th Golden Globe Awards]], Carrey was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor in a Comedy]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nFletcher Reede is a lawyer and divorced father living in Los Angeles. He loves spending time with his young son Max; they often play a game where Fletcher makes his hand into \"the Claw\", with which he tickles Max and pretends to chase him. However, Fletcher has a habit of giving precedence to his career, breaking promises to Max and his former wife Audrey, and then lying about the reasons. Fletcher's compulsive lying has also built him a reputation as a successful defense lawyer at his firm. On Max's birthday, Fletcher misses Max's party when senior partner Miranda lures him to get promoted by having sex in the office. Max makes a birthday wish that Fletcher would be unable to tell a lie for an entire day\u2014a wish that immediately becomes true.\n\nFletcher soon discovers, through a series of embarrassing incidents, that he is unable to lie, mislead or withhold the truth. This goes so far as being restrained from writing a false statement. These incidents are inconvenient, ranging from being dumped by Miranda after his honest review about their one night stand, alienating his secretary Greta when she realizes his law practices have hampered true justice, and his inability to bend the truth in court. His client is Samantha Cole, a [[gold digger]] who wants a nut from her soon-to-be ex-husband Richard Cole. The main witness, Kenneth Falk, with whom Samantha has been cheating, is eager to commit [[perjury]] to win. However, Fletcher cannot ask questions if the respondent will lie. Meanwhile, Audrey is planning to move to [[Boston]] with her new fianc\u00e9 Jerry, and decides to take Max with them to protect him from the disappointment Fletcher causes him when he breaks his promises.\n\nFletcher tries desperately to delay the case, even beating himself up, but is unable to lie his way into a [[continuance]]. Knowing that he cannot deny the proof of Samantha's adultery, he successfully disputes the validity of her [[prenuptial agreement]] after accidentally discovering that she had signed it as a [[minor (law)|minor]] without [[parental consent]]. This entitles Samantha to 50% of Richard's marital assets, equal to $11.395 million, affording Fletcher to win the case truthfully. However, Samantha also insists on contesting [[child custody|custody of their children]] for an extra $10,000 in monthly [[child support]] payments from Richard. A disheartened Fletcher, realizing that he had corrupted Samantha with his own lies, watches as she pulls her crying children out of Richard's arms. Horrified by his actions, Fletcher demands that the judge reverse the decision, but his attitude angers the judge and he is arrested for [[contempt of court]]. Fletcher calls Audrey to bail him out, but she informs him that their plane leaves for Boston that night. Greta bails him out, having realized he reformed.\n\nRecognizing Max as his highest priority, Fletcher rushes to the airport, but Audrey and Max's flight has already left the terminal. In desperation, he hijacks a mobile stairway to pursue the plane onto the runway. After throwing one of his shoes at the plane's windshield, it finally stops, but Fletcher is injured after he crashes the mobile stairway. On a stretcher, Fletcher vows to Max that he will spend more time with him. He says that he is free to lie now that 24 hours have elapsed, but realizes it feels better to be honest. Max believes his dad, and Audrey decides to remain in California.\n\nOne year later, Fletcher has started his own small firm with Greta. Fletcher and Audrey are celebrating Max's birthday. Max makes a birthday wish, only to find that Fletcher and Audrey are kissing. Fletcher asks Max if he wished for them to get back together, but Max says he only wished for roller blades. The family returns to normal as Fletcher chases Audrey and Max around the house with \"the Claw\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as Fletcher Reede\n* [[Maura Tierney]] as Audrey Reede\n* [[Justin Cooper (actor)|Justin Cooper]] as Max Reede\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as Jerry\n* [[Anne Haney]] as Greta\n* [[Jennifer Tilly]] as Samantha Cole\n* [[Amanda Donohoe]] as Miranda\n* [[Jason Bernard]] as Judge Marshall Stevens\n* [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as Dana Appleton\n* [[Mitchell Ryan]] as Mr. Allan\n* [[Christopher Mayer (American actor)|Chip Mayer]] as Kenneth Falk\n* [[Eric Pierpoint]] as Richard Cole\n* [[Randall \"Tex\" Cobb]] as Skull\n* [[Cheri Oteri]] as Jane\n* S W Fisher as Pete\n* [[Ben Lemon]] as Randy\n* [[Jarrad Paul]] as Zit Boy\n* [[Marianne Muellerleile]] as Ms. Berry\n* [[Krista Allen]] as Lady in Elevator\n* Stephen James Carver as Police Officer\n* [[Don Keefer]] as Beggar at Courthouse\n}}\n\nIn addition to portraying Fletcher Reede, Carrey has a [[cameo appearance]] as Fire Marshall Bill at the end of the film, seeing to Reede's injuries after he crashes a mobile stairway, reprising his role from ''[[In Living Color]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/films/986174/Jim-Carrey-Liar-Liar-cameo-Fire-Marshall-Bill|title=Jim Carrey played ANOTHER role in comedy classic Liar Liar: Did you spot his secret cameo?|first=Shaun|last=Kitchener|date=July 9, 2018|website=express.co.uk}}</ref> ''Liar Liar'' was the film debut of actress [[Sara Paxton]], who played one of Max's classmates and his birthday party attendant.
