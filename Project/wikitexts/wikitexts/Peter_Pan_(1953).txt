M. Barrie]]. Directed by [[Clyde Geronimi]], [[Hamilton Luske]] and [[Wilfred Jackson]], it is the 14th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]]. Starring the voices of [[Bobby Driscoll]], [[Kathryn Beaumont]], [[Hans Conried]], [[Paul Collins (actor)|Paul Collins]], [[Heather Angel (actress)|Heather Angel]], and [[Bill Thompson (voice actor)|Bill Thompson]], the film's plot involves a group of children who meet [[Peter Pan]] and travel to the island of [[Neverland|Never Land]] to stay young, where Peter also attempts to evade [[Captain Hook]].\n\nThe film was entered into the [[1953 Cannes Film Festival]],<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3894/year/1953.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Peter Pan |access-date=January 23, 2009 |work=festival-cannes.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822155433/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3894/year/1953.html |archive-date=August 22, 2011 }}</ref> and was originally released on February 5, 1953 by [[RKO Radio Pictures]]. ''Peter Pan'' was the final Disney animated feature released through RKO before [[Walt Disney]] founded [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|his own distribution company]], as well as the final Disney film in which all nine members of [[Disney's Nine Old Men]] worked together as directing animators. A sequel titled ''[[Return to Never Land]]'' was released in 2002, and a [[Tinker Bell (film series)|series of direct-to-DVD prequels]] produced by [[Disneytoon Studios]] focusing on Tinker Bell began in 2008. A [[Peter Pan & Wendy|live-action adaptation]] is scheduled to be released on [[Disney+]] in 2023.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot should be between 400 and 700 words. Please check word count before adding anything. Current count 546-->\nIn [[Edwardian]] London, George and Mary Darling's preparations to attend a party are disrupted by the antics of their boys, John and Michael, who are acting out a [[Peter Pan]] story told them by their elder sister [[Wendy Darling|Wendy]]. An irritated George demands that Wendy drop the stories and move out of the nursery, since \"sooner or later, people have to grow up\". Later that night, Peter himself arrives in the nursery to find his lost shadow. He persuades Wendy to come to [[Neverland]], where she will never have to grow up, and she and the boys fly there with the begrudging help of the pixie [[Tinker Bell]].\n\nA ship of [[pirates]] is anchored off Neverland, led by [[Captain Hook]] and his first mate, [[Mr. Smee]]. Hook wants revenge on Peter for cutting off his hand, but fears the crocodile which consumed the hand, knowing it is eager to eat the rest of him. When Pan and the Darlings arrive, Hook shoots at them with a cannon, and Peter sends the Darlings off to safety while he baits the pirates. Tinker Bell, who is jealous of Pan's attention to Wendy, convinces the [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|Lost Boys]] that Pan has ordered them to shoot down Wendy. Tinker Bell's treachery is soon found out, and Peter [[banishment|banishes]] her. John and Michael set off with the Lost Boys to find the island's [[Indigenous peoples|Native Americans]]; however, the Natives capture the group, believing them to be responsible for taking the chief's daughter, [[Tiger Lily (Peter Pan)|Tiger Lily]].\n\nMeanwhile, Peter takes Wendy to see the [[mermaid]]s, who flee in terror when Hook arrives on the scene. Peter and Wendy see that Hook and Smee have captured Tiger Lily, to force her to disclose Peter's hideout. Peter frees Tiger Lily and returns her to the Chief, and the tribe honors Peter. Meanwhile, Hook takes advantage of Tinker Bell's jealousy of Wendy, tricking the fairy into revealing Peter's secret hideout.\n\nWendy and her brothers eventually grow homesick and plan to return to London. They invite Peter and the Lost Boys to join them and be adopted by the Darlings. The Lost Boys agree, but Peter does not want to grow up and refuses. The pirates lie in wait, and capture the Lost Boys and the Darlings as they exit the lair, leaving behind a [[time bomb]] to kill Peter. Tinker Bell learns of the plot, just in time to snatch the bomb from Peter as it explodes.\n\nPeter rescues Tinker Bell from the rubble, and together they rescue Wendy, confronting the pirates, and releasing the children before they can [[walk the plank]]. Peter engages Hook in combat as the children fight off the crew, and defeats him. Hook falls into the sea and swims away, pursued by the crocodile. Peter commandeers the deserted ship and, assisted by Tinker Bell's pixie dust, flies it to London with the children aboard.\n\nGeorge and Mary Darling return home from the party, and find Wendy sleeping at the nursery's open window. Wendy awakens and excitedly tells about their adventures. The parents look out the window and see what appears to be a pirate ship in the clouds. George, who has softened his position about Wendy staying in the nursery, recognizes the ship from his own childhood.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|Characters of Peter Pan}}\n* [[Bobby Driscoll]] as [[Peter Pan]], a boy who refuses to grow up. He is cocky, commanding, and insensitive at times, but also deeply caring, especially when it comes to Tinker Bell's safety. He finds enjoyment in fighting Captain Hook and was responsible for the loss of Hook's left hand. He was modeled by Roland Dupree.\n* [[Tinker Bell]]: a hot-headed, nonspeaking pixie/fairy and Peter Pan's closest friend, who grows jealous of Wendy and Peter's relationship, although Peter assures her that he loves her the most. Her movements were modeled on [[Margaret Kerry]].\n* [[Kathryn Beaumont]] as [[Wendy Darling]], at age 12 the eldest and most mature of the Darling children, who adores Peter Pan. Naive but wise, she has a mothering instinct that appeals to her brothers and the Lost Boys, desires the best for everyone, and holds no grudges against other girls interested in Peter.\n* [[Paul Collins (actor)|Paul Collins]] as John Darling, at age 8 the older of the two Darling boys. He acts very sophisticated and maturely for his age and is an analytical thinker and skilled strategist. He wears large, black glasses and is tall and slim. All the Darling children wear their nightgowns to Never Land, but he also takes a black [[top hat]] and an umbrella with him, showing exaggerated maturity.\n* Tommy Luske as Michael Darling, at age 4 the youngest and most sensitive, clumsy, and playful of the three Darling children. He carries a [[teddy bear]] with him to Never Land.\n* [[Heather Angel (actress)|Heather Angel]] as Mary Darling, the Darling children's sage and kind mother. She is much calmer and more understanding of her daughter's stories than her husband, even though she takes them with a [[pinch of salt]].\n* Nana: the Darlings' nursemaid, a [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]] dog (originally a [[Newfoundland dog]]). She is able to take care of the Darling children as well as any human nursemaid can. She is very efficient at her work, and possesses much tolerance for the children's messes. She only barks and is musically represented by the bassoon.\n* [[Hans Conried]] as [[Captain Hook]], a [[pirate]] captain who seeks revenge on Pan for having his left hand chopped off and fed to the [[Crocodile]] in a battle. He is a dangerous villain, though completely dependent on his personal assistant, Mr. Smee, and very childish in his fear of the crocodile.\n**In keeping the tradition of the stage play, Conried also voices George Darling, the Darling children's moody, dramatic, practical, but ultimately gentle father. He is at first frustrated by Wendy telling the boys imaginary tales about Peter Pan, dismissing them as immature, but later changes his mind.\n* [[Bill Thompson (voice actor)|Bill Thompson]] as [[Mr. Smee]], Hook's first mate, personal assistant, and [[comic relief]]. His fellow crewmen (also voiced by Thompson) tease him into trying to convince Hook to give up the search for Peter Pan.\n* The Crocodile: A crocodile who swallowed an [[alarm clock]] and is after the remains of Hook. Pan had cut off Hook's hand and thrown it to the Crocodile, causing it to acquire a taste for Hook and thus follow him ever since. Its character was later known as Tick-Tock the Croc.\n* [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|The Lost Boys]]: Pan's right-hand boys, dressed as various animals. Their names are Slightly (fox costume; voiced by [[Simon Singer|Stuffy Singer]]), Cubby (bear costume; voiced by [[Robert Ellis (actor, born 1933)|Robert Ellis]]), Nibs (rabbit costume; voiced by Jeffrey Silver), Tootles (skunk costume; never speaks) and the Twins (raccoon costumes; voiced by Johnny McGovern). Their origin remains a mystery, though they claim to have once had mothers of their own. They are very savage boys who get into fights easily with each other, but when they have a common goal to attain, they act as one. [[Tony Butala]] provides their singing voices.\n* [[June Foray]], Connie Hilton, Karen Kester, and Margaret Kerry as the mermaids, Peter's friends who are very interested in his heroic stories of himself. They are resentful of Wendy and easily frightened by Captain Hook. The mermaids appear to be in their mid-teens, with very womanly exposed bodies, resembling women in two-part bathing suits.\n* [[Tiger Lily (Peter Pan)|Tiger Lily]] is the [[Tribal chief|Native American Chief]]'s daughter, who, like most women on the island, is attracted to Peter. She does not speak save to call for help, and her voice is uncredited.\n* [[Candy Candido]] as the fierce-looking but well-meaning Chief of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. He and his people have fought the Lost Boys on many previous occasions with mixed victories.\n* June Foray as the Native American Squaw, who orders Wendy to get firewood while everyone else celebrates Peter Pan's honor from the tribe. She resembles the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)#Disney|Queen of Hearts]] from Disney's 1951 animated film ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''.\n* [[Tom Conway]] as the narrator, whose voice is heard only at the beginning of the film.\n* [[The Mellomen]] ([[Thurl Ravenscroft]], [[Bill Lee (singer)|Bill Lee]], [[The Mellomen|Bob Stevens]] and [[The Mellomen|Max Smith]]) as the pirate and Native American choruses.\n\n==Production==\nIn 1913, Walt Disney saw a touring production at Carter Opera House starting [[Maude Adams]] as Peter Pan in [[Marceline, Missouri|Marceline]]. At Park School, Walt play Peter Pan with his brother Roy manning a block and tackle which the rope snapped and, as Walt recalled, \u201cI flew right into the faces of the surprised audience\u201d, also mentioned that he was more realistic than Maude Adams in the end of his performance. In 1924, Walt saw a [[Peter Pan (1924 film)|Silent Film]] that inspired his imagination. In 1935, Walt Disney expressed interest in doing an adaptation of ''Peter Pan'' as his second film following ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.<ref name=\"PeterPanThatAlmostWas\">{{cite AV media notes|title=The Peter Pan That Almost Was|year=2007|type=DVD bonus feature|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment}}</ref> However, the live-action film rights were held by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The copyright owner, [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|the Hospital for Sick Children in London]], unsuccessfully offered to have Disney make an agreement with Paramount. However, in January 1939, Disney obtained the animation rights to the play by outbidding [[Fleischer Studios]], which was also developing animated feature films.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=183}}<ref name=\"YouCanFly\">{{cite AV media notes|title=You Can Fly: The Making of Peter Pan|year=2007|type=DVD bonus feature|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment}}</ref> By early 1939, a story reel had been completed,{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=490}} and by the following May, Disney had several animators in mind for the characters. [[Bill Tytla|Vladimir Tytla]] was considered for the pirates, [[Norm Ferguson (animator)|Norman Ferguson]] for the dog, Nana (who also animated [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]]) and [[Fred Moore (animator)|Fred Moore]] for Tinker Bell.{{sfn|Barrier|2008|p=230}}\n\nDuring this time, Disney explored many possible interpretations of the story. In the earliest version, the film would start by telling Peter Pan's [[backstory]]. But during a story meeting on May 20, 1940, Disney said, \"We ought to get right into the story itself, where Peter Pan comes to the house to get his shadow. That's where the story picks up. How Peter came to be is really another story.\"<ref name=\"PeterPanThatAlmostWas\" /> Disney also explored the idea of opening the film in Never Land with Peter Pan coming to Wendy's house to kidnap her as a mother for the Lost Boys. Eventually, Disney decided that the kidnapping plot was too dark, and he went back to Barrie's original play in which Peter comes to get his shadow and Wendy is eager to see Never Land.<ref name=\"PeterPanThatAlmostWas\" />\n\nFollowing [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941]], the United States military took control of the studio and commissioned Walt Disney Productions to produce training and war propaganda films, so pre-production work on ''Peter Pan'' and ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' was shelved.{{sfn|Thomas|1994|p=175\u201377}} However, the [[Bank of America]] allowed production to continue during the war.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=490}} After the war, work on the film resumed with [[Jack Kinney]] as director. At the time, Kinney had considered leaving Walt Disney Productions for the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio]], but wartime restrictions prevented it. Because he did not want Kinney to get out of his contract, Disney appointed Kinney to direct ''Peter Pan''.<ref>{{cite interview|url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Interviews/Kinney1976/Kinney1976.html|title=Interviews: Jack Kinney and Jane Kinney (1976)|subject=Jack Kinney and Jane Kinney|interviewer=Michael Barrier and Milton Gray|publisher=MichaelBarrier.com|date=February 11, 2016|access-date=August 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring this same time, Disney talked to [[Mary Martin]], who was appearing in a stage production of the play, about voicing Peter Pan, although [[Roy O. Disney]] complained that her voice was \"too heavy, matured, and sophisticated.\" [[Jean Arthur]] contacted Walt about being considered for the role. Disney had also talked to [[Cary Grant]] about voicing Captain Hook, a possibility to which Grant replied that the \"idea intrigued him.\"{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=490}} Impatient with the delays, Disney asked Kinney to work on sequences consecutively rather than finishing the entire script before it was storyboarded, so that a scene would be approved at a morning story meeting and then immediately put into development. Six months later, during a storyboard meeting, Kinney presented a two-and-a-half-hour presentation, during which Disney sat silently and then stated, \"You know, I've been thinking about ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''.\"{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=460}}\n\nBy 1947, Walt Disney Productions' financial health started to improve again.{{sfn|Barrier|2008|p=205}} Around this time, Walt Disney acknowledged the need for sound economic policies, but emphasized to his financial backers that slashing production would be suicidal. In order to restore the studio to full financial health, Disney expressed his desire to return to producing full-length animated films. By then, three animated projects\u2014''Cinderella'', ''Alice in Wonderland'', and ''Peter Pan''\u2014were in development. Disney felt the characters in ''Alice in Wonderland'' and ''Peter Pan'' were too cold, but as ''Cinderella'' contained elements similar to those in ''Snow White'', he decided to [[green-light]] ''Cinderella''.{{sfn|Thomas|1994|p=209}} In May 1949, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that ''Peter Pan'' had been placed back into production.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/details/variety174-1949-05/page/n59/mode/2up|title='Pan' Start Gives Disney Record 6 Features Lensing|work=Variety|page=5|date=May 11, 1949|access-date=November 12, 2020|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref>\n\nThe scene in the nursery went through many alterations. In one version, it is Mrs. Darling who finds Peter Pan's shadow and shows it to Mr. Darling, as in the original play. In another version of the film, Nana goes to Never Land with Pan and the Darling children, the story being told through her eyes. In another interpretation of the story, John Darling is left behind for being too serious, practical and boring, but story artist [[Ralph Wright]] convinced Disney to have John go with the others to Never Land. This adaptation also included Wendy bringing her Peter Pan picture book and Peter and the children eating an \"imaginary dinner\".<ref name=\"PeterPanThatAlmostWas\" /> At one point, a party in Peter's hideout was conceived at which Tinker Bell becomes humiliated and, in her rage, tells Captain Hook the location of Peter Pan's hideout of her own free will. However, Disney felt that this story was contrary to Tinker Bell's character; instead, he had Captain Hook kidnapping Tinker Bell and persuading her to tell him. In Barrie's play, Captain Hook puts poison in Peter's dose of medicine and Tinker Bell saves Peter by drinking the poison herself, only to be revived by the applause of the theater audience. After much debate, Disney discarded this story development, fearing it would be difficult to achieve in a film.<ref name=\"PeterPanThatAlmostWas\" />\n\nIn earlier scripts, there were more scenes involving the pirates and mermaids that were similar to those with the dwarfs in ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs''. Ultimately, these scenes were cut for pacing reasons.<ref name=\"dvdaudiocommentary\">{{cite AV media notes|title=Peter Pan Platinum Edition|others=[[Roy E. Disney]], [[Leonard Maltin]], Jeff Kurtti, Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, Marc Davis, Kathryn Beaumont, Margaret Kerry|type=Audio commentary|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment|location=Burbank, California|year=2007}}</ref> The film concept was also a bit darker at one point than that of the finished product; for example, there were scenes involving Captain Hook being killed by the crocodile, the Darling family mourning over their lost children and Pan and the children discovering the pirates' treasure loaded with [[booby trap]]s.<ref name=\"PeterPanThatAlmostWas\"/>\n\n===Animation===\n====Live-action reference====\nAs with previous Disney animated features, a live-action version was filmed to serve as an aid to animators with the actors performing to a prerecorded dialogue track.

[[Bobby Driscoll]] also served as the live-action reference model for Peter Pan, although he was mainly used for the close-up scenes. [[Hans Conried]] completed the voice work over the course of a few days, and served as the live-action reference for two and a half years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gargiulo|first=Suzanne|title=Hans Conried: A Biography; With a Filmography and a Listing of Radio, Television, Stage and Voice Work|chapter=Peter Pan, The Twonky, and Dr. T.|page=78|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2002|isbn=978-0786413386|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNkE0c78qYQC&q=hans+conried+captain+hook&pg=PA79|via=Google Books}}</ref> He later did the same kind of thing as the live action reference for [[Aurora (Disney)|Princess Aurora\u2019s]] father, [[List of Disney's Sleeping Beauty characters|King Stefan]], in [[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|''Sleeping Beauty'']], although he did not get the chance in voicing Stefan as [[Taylor Holmes]] was given the task instead. In addition to being the voice role and model for [[Portrayals of Alice in Wonderland|Alice]] in [[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|''Alice in Wonderland'']], [[Kathryn Beaumont]], who was also the voice of Wendy, also performed for the live-action reference footage for Wendy.<ref name=\"YouCanFly\" />\n\n====Character animation====\n[[Milt Kahl]] wanted to animate Captain Hook but was instead assigned to animate Peter Pan and the Darling children; he claimed he was \"outmaneuvered\".<ref>{{cite video|title=From Fantasia to Fantasyland|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPWm-cgTcf4|time=17:55|via=[[YouTube]]|access-date=August 25, 2017}}</ref> During production, while animating Peter Pan, Kahl claimed that the hardest thing to animate was a character floating in mid-air.<ref name=\"YouCanFly\" /> While observing the animation of Peter Pan, Walt Disney complained that the animators had let too many of Bobby Driscoll's facial features find their way into the character design, telling Kahl that \"[t]hey are too masculine, too old. There is something wrong there.\" Kahl replied, \"You want to know what's wrong!?...What's wrong is that they don't have any talent in the place.\"{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=460}}\n\nThe job of animating Captain Hook was assigned to [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]], who faced conflicting visions of the character. Story artist Ed Penner viewed Hook as \"a very foppish, not strong, dandy-type, who loved all the finery. Kind of a con man. [Co-director Gerry] Geronimi saw him as an [[Ernest Torrence]]: a mean, heavy sort of character who used his hook menacingly.\" When Walt Disney saw Thomas' first test scenes, he said, \"Well, that last scene has something I like I think you're beginning to get him. I think we better wait and let Frank go on a little further.\"<ref>{{cite book  |last=Barrier |first=Michael |title=Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age |url=https://archive.org/details/hollywoodcartoon00barr |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/hollywoodcartoon00barr/page/551/mode/2up 551] |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-195-16729-0}}</ref>{{sfn|Canemaker|2001|p=190}} Because Thomas could not animate every scene of Hook, certain sequences were given to [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], such as that showing Hook trying to escape Tick-Tock the crocodile.{{sfn|Canemaker|2001|p=45\u20136}}\n\n[[Ollie Johnston]] animated Mr. Smee. To best capture his comedic yet fear-ridden, sycophantic personality, Johnston used a variation of the Dwarf design from ''Snow White'', and had Mr. Smee blink repeatedly. Johnston's former mentor, Fred Moore, worked in his unit as a character animator for Smee's minor scenes. Moore also animated the mermaids and the Lost Boys. On November 22, 1952, Moore and his wife were involved in an auto accident on Mount Gleason Drive in Los Angeles.
