His mother eventually leaves and becomes a prostitute. His father joins the Army, leaving James in the care of his brothel-running aunt. He is fascinated by the [[shout (Black gospel music)|shout music]] at a [[Black Church (African American)|black church]]. Later, he fights in a \"[[battle royal]]\" boxing match for the amusement of a white audience. Imagining the [[jazz]] band breaking into a [[funk]] style inspires him to win the bout. He spots his mother on the street one night, but she denies knowing him.\n\nIn 1949, 17 year-old James is imprisoned for stealing a suit. When [[Bobby Byrd]] and his [[gospel music|gospel]] group perform at the prison, James is inspired. He impresses Bobby with his singing, and Bobby's family supervises his [[parole]]. James establishes himself as a lead singer and shifts the group's sound toward [[rhythm and blues|R&B]]. He leads them to jump onstage at a [[Little Richard]] show, introduces them as \"[[the Famous Flames]]\", and they perform a rousing rendition of \"[[Caldonia]]\". Richard gives James advice and warns him of the \"white devil\". James marries Velma Warren, and they have a son, Teddy. In 1955, [[Ralph Bass]] signs the band to [[King Records (United States)|King Records]] and records their first [[single (music)|single]], \"[[Please, Please, Please]]\". Ben Bart becomes James' manager; he and label executive [[Syd Nathan]] relegate the rest of the band to salaried employee status, and they quit.\n\nBy 1962 James and Bobby have re-formed the band, and James finances the recording of the hugely successful ''[[Live at the Apollo (1963 album)|Live at the Apollo]]''. After the show he is approached by his mother, who apologizes for leaving him. He wants nothing to do with her, but gives her financial support. In 1964 James upstages the up-and-coming [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] on the ''[[T.A.M.I. Show]]'' with his high-energy performance and dance moves. By paying young radio DJs to promote his shows, he is able to avoid [[promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] fees. He divorces Velma and marries Deidre Jenkins, but becomes abusive toward her. He treats his new backing band like lackeys, fining them for various infractions, calling rehearsals on their days off, and berating them for questioning him. He develops a signature [[groove (music)|groove]], laying the foundation for funk.\n\nWhen the [[King-assassination riots]] break out in 1968, James convinces the mayor of Boston not to cancel his show at the [[Boston Garden]]. Tensions are high between the police and the black audience, but James calms the crowd and issues a plea for togetherness. He records \"[[Say It Loud \u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud]]\" and pitches President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] his idea to perform a series of [[United Service Organizations|USO]] shows for American troops in [[Vietnam]]. Though their plane is nearly shot down, the band survives and their performance is well-received.\n\nJames suffers several setbacks, beginning with Ben's death from a heart attack. He starts several businesses and is investigated by the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] for [[back taxes]]. His band presents a list of demands; when James rebuffs them, all quit except Bobby, who helps him assemble a new band. After a 1971 concert in Paris, Bobby proposes doing a second solo album. James considers this a betrayal; they argue and Bobby quits. James' eldest son, Teddy, dies in a car accident.\n\nIn Augusta in 1988, James gets high on [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] and visits one of his businesses, finding that someone from a neighboring seminar has used his private restroom. He confronts the seminar carrying a shotgun, which he accidentally fires into the ceiling before forgiving the offender. The police arrive and James flees in his truck, crashing through a roadblock before being apprehended and imprisoned.\n\nIn 1993, James meets Bobby for the first time in 20 years and gives him tickets to his concert at [[Atlanta]]'s [[Omni Coliseum]]. As he takes the stage, he reflects on the cost he has paid for success. Seeing Bobby and his wife in the audience, he performs \"[[Try Me (James Brown song)|Try Me]]\", moving them to tears.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Chadwick Boseman]] as [[James Brown]]<ref name=\"Chadwick\" />\n** Jamarion and Jordan Scott as young James Brown<ref>{{cite news |last= Ali |first= Lorraine|title=Getting it together for James Brown biopic|date=July 24, 2014|work=The Los Angeles Times|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-get-on-up-20140727-story.html|access-date=August 10, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Nelsan Ellis]] as [[Bobby Byrd]]<ref name=\"Nelsan\" />\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Ben Bart<ref name=\"Jill\" />\n* [[Viola Davis]] as Susie Brown<ref name=\"Viola\" />\n* [[Lennie James]] as Joseph \"Joe\" Brown<ref name=\"Lennie\" />\n* [[Fred Melamed]] as [[Syd Nathan]]\n* Jamal Batiste as [[John \"Jabo\" Starks]]\n* [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]] as [[Maceo Parker]]<ref name=\"Jill\" />\n* [[Jill Scott (singer)|Jill Scott]] as Deidre \"Dee-Dee\" Jenkins<ref name=\"Jill\" />\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Aunt Honey Washington<ref name=\"Viola\" />\n* [[Atkins Estimond]] as Big Junior\n* [[Josh Hopkins]] as [[Ralph Bass]]<ref name=\"Josh\" />\n* [[Brandon Mychal Smith]] as [[Little Richard]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/03/janina-gavankar-joins-the-mysteries-of-laura-brandon-smith-in-one-big-happy/ |title=Janina Gavankar Joins 'The Mysteries Of Laura', Brandon Smith In 'One Big Happy' |publisher=Deadline.com |date=2014-03-13 |access-date=2014-07-20}}</ref>\n* [[Tika Sumpter]] as [[Yvonne Fair]]<ref name=\"Tika\" />\n* [[Aunjanue Ellis]] as [[Vicki Anderson]] \n* [[Black Thought|Tariq Trotter]] as [[Alfred \"Pee Wee\" Ellis|Pee Wee Ellis]]\n* [[Aloe Blacc]] as Nafloyd Scott\n* [[Keith Robinson (actor)|Keith Robinson]] as Baby Roy<ref name=\"Keith\" />\n* [[Nick Eversman]] as [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\"Nick\" />\n* [[J.
