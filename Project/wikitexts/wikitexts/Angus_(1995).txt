The cast includes Charlie Talbert and [[James Van Der Beek]] in their first film roles, along with [[Chris Owen (actor)|Chris Owen]], [[Ariana Richards]], [[George C. Scott]], [[Kathy Bates]], and [[Rita Moreno]]. ''Angus'' is based on the [[short story]] \"A Brief Moment in the Life of Angus Bethune\" by [[Chris Crutcher]], from his collection ''[[Athletic Shorts: Six Short Stories]]''.\n\nIt is mostly filmed in [[Owatonna, Minnesota]] at [[Owatonna Senior High School]].\n\n==Plot==\nAngus Bethune is an overweight teenage boy living in [[Minnesota]] who, despite his talents in football and science, holds deep insecurities. Since kindergarten, he has been harassed by handsome, cruel Rick Sanford and his cohorts for not being \"normal\". His only friend is Troy Wedberg, another social outcast. Angus has feelings for Melissa Lefevre, a cheerleader who is dating Rick. Tired of Rick's abuse, Angus applies to a [[magnet school]] where he hopes to be free of the bullying. Rick, well aware of Angus' feelings for Melissa, rigs a school [[election]] so that Angus and Melissa will dance together in the upcoming freshman Winter Ball as King and Queen, respectively. After the stunt, the principal forbids Angus to lay a hand on Rick, or he would be expelled and lose his chance to go to the magnet school.\n\nTo prepare for the dance, Angus gets help from Troy, his mother Meg, and his narcoleptic grandfather Ivan. Angus takes dancing lessons with Madame Rulenska, but the lessons go badly. Despite Angus' request for a black tuxedo, Ivan purchases him a plum suit and tells him he can be normal and an individual at the same time. Ivan reasons that running away to another school will not solve anything and that he needs to stand up to Rick.\n\nOne day after school, Rick and his friends kidnap Troy and ask him for anything that would embarrass Angus at the Winter Ball. Troy refuses to help them, but ends up breaking his arm as he tries to get away. Meanwhile, Angus helps Ivan prepare for his wedding to his fianc\u00e9e April. As Angus waits outside Ivan's room on the day of the wedding, he confides to him about how he wishes he could stand up to Rick and tell Melissa how he feels. When Angus tries to wake Ivan, he quickly discovers that Ivan has died and tells the wedding guests. Distraught, Angus opts to stay home for a few days trying to cope with Ivan's death.\n\nOut of fear, Troy gives Rick a [[videotape]] containing footage of Angus practicing his dancing with an inflatable doll while confessing his feelings for Melissa. While visiting Angus to offer his condolences, an argument ensues between the two friends. Angus asserts he won't go to the Winter Ball because he doesn't want to be humiliated by Rick again and needs to cope with his grandfather's death.\n\nLater that week, Angus receives a box from April containing the plum suit that he had earlier rejected. In that moment, Angus realizes Ivan was right all along: he needs to stand up for himself and face Rick, or nothing will change. He rejects an interview from the magnet school and marches to the dance in the school [[gym]]nasium wearing the plum suit. Inside, Angus converses with Melissa for the first time. Before they can dance as King and Queen, Rick plays Troy's videotape on the monitors, prompting laughter from students. A humiliated Melissa punches Rick in the face and runs out in tears. Angus follows her, infuriated at Troy for his betrayal.\n\nAngus apologizes to Melissa, but she does not blame him. Instead, she reveals her disgust with Rick and confesses to Angus that she is [[bulimia|bulimic]]. Angus learns that Melissa likes him more than Rick because he is kind and respectful of others. Finding common ground, they go back inside and dance, with Melissa helping him out with some of the steps. When Rick scolds Melissa, Angus comes to her defense. Rick punches Angus, breaking his nose and sending him crashing through a table. Angus defiantly rises to his feet and repeatedly pushes Rick until he falls to the ground, saying no matter how many times Rick knocks him down, he will always get back up. When Angus gives Rick a choice to accept others who are different from him, Rick selfishly replies, \"Whatever I am, it's something you're never gonna be,\" to which Angus retorts, \"Thank God!\" The students applaud Angus and even Rick's friends abandon him. Melissa dances with Angus again and Troy enacts revenge on Rick by breaking his nose with his cast.\n\nMelissa asks Angus to walk her home, and they kiss. Angus rejects an offer to transfer to the magnet school, realizing that his grandfather was right and that he doesn't have to run away anymore. Angus mentions Rick was suspended for his video prank and for breaking Troy's arm. He also mentions that Rick's popularity with the other students suffered since Angus stood up to him and thus they have no reason to fear him anymore.\n\n===Alternate cut===\nThe script was originally more faithful to its source material, with the storyline of Angus having a [[gay]] father included among the filmed scenes.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Crutcher |first=Chris |author-link=Chris Crutcher |title=Angus -- The Movie |url=http://www.chriscrutcher.com/angus----the-movie.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324091212/http://www.chriscrutcher.com/angus----the-movie.html |archive-date=March 24, 2016 |access-date=April 5, 2022 |website=Author & Loudmouth |language=en}}</ref> However, during a test screening in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], an audience member reacted with a homophobic insult to the gay-related plot line.
