Set in a [[dystopian future]] in which [[population control]] is enforced through a school [[aptitude test]]. Those who fail it are executed.\n\nThe film received a lukewarm reception from critics, though audience reception was more positive. Praise focused on the performances of Paul and List, concept and interesting themes but was criticized for not taking full advantage of its premise.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2039, due to Earth's [[human overpopulation]], the [[United Nations]] instructs all nations to annually cut their populations by 5%. The United States implements the 10-241 or \"the Thinning\", a [[standardized test]] in which those who fail will be executed.\n\nBlake Redding, son of [[Texas governor]] Dean Redding, is dating a girl named Ellie Harper, neither of whom study for the exam. Blake passes the exams, while Ellie fails. Blake calls his father in an attempt to free Ellie, but he refuses.\n\nOn the day of his last exam a year later, Blake makes a video saying that he will [[Suicide|purposefully fail his exam]] to test his father's loyalty. Redding takes notice of this announcement, and test manager Mason King, also head of the [[Human population planning#See also|Department of Population Control]], is ordered to pass Blake regardless of his score. Mason switches his score with genius classmate Laina Michaels, passing Blake. A teacher named Ms. Birch secretly hands Laina a keycard so she can unlock the doors and escape. Blake cuts the school's power, allowing Laina to escape. That, however, is hindered by the school initiating lockdown. After using the keycard, Laina meets up with Blake.\n\nAfter a series of escapades with the guards, Laina goes to the [[server room]] to check the scores, learning that test scores are shuffled, resulting in the wrongful deaths of many students with passing scores. Laina gives it to her friend Kellan, who is acquainted with a [[news anchor]]. The power is turned on, and Laina is caught on camera, thus taken to the Thinning. Blake, still in the disguise, attempts to release all the failed students, but is caught by the guards. After photos of the system's misconduct are leaked, Redding reluctantly executes all of those who actually failed, including Blake, by injection. As the lockdown ends, Laina is reunited with her younger sister Corrine as well as Ms. Birch, who has been taking care of Corrine since their mother's death.\n\nBlake and the rest are taken underground, where many people are working for tech company Assuru Global. As Blake slowly wakes up from what was actually a [[Benzodiazepine|sleep drug]], he sees a blonde girl working: Ellie.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Logan Paul]] as Blake Redding\n*[[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton List]] as Laina Michaels\n*[[Lia Marie Johnson]] as Ellie Harper\n*[[Calum Worthy]] as Kellan Woods\n*[[Ryan Newman (actress)|Ryan Newman]] as Sarah Foster\n*[[Michael Traynor (actor)|Michael Traynor]] as Mason King\n*[[Stacey Dash]] as Kendra Birch\n*[[Matthew Glave]] as Gov.
