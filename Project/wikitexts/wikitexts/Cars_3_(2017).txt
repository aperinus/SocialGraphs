It was executive produced by [[John Lasseter]], who directed the first two ''Cars'' films.

The film entered production in 2014, with Lasseter stating that it would be a \"very emotional story\", similar in tone to the first one, prior to the film's release. The production team did a lot of research, mainly focused on NASCAR racers. They want the film to feel like a sports film while also focusing on McQueen realizing what their relationship meant to Doc Hudson. [[Randy Newman]], who had worked on the first film, composed the film's score with artists such as [[Andra Day]], [[James Bay (singer)|James Bay]], [[Brad Paisley]] and [[Jorge Blanco (musician)|Jorge Blanco]] contributing tracks for the film.\n\n''Cars 3'' was first screened for the NASCAR industry in [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]] on May 23, 2017, before its worldwide theatrical release on June 16, accompanied by the animated short film ''[[Lou (2017 film)|Lou]]''. It grossed $383 million worldwide against its $175 million budget, becoming the lowest-grossing film of the franchise, but still a box office success. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its animation, story, and emotional depth, with many of them deeming it an improvement over its predecessor.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400 to 700 words only. -->\nSix years after [[Cars 2|competing in the World Grand Prix]], [[Lightning McQueen]], now a five-time<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pixar.com/feature-films/cars-3|title=Pixar Animation Studios|access-date=September 9, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220811210634/https://www.pixar.com/feature-films/cars-3|archive-date=August 11, 2022|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Piston Cup champion, finds himself overshadowed by Jackson Storm, a rookie who is part of a new generation of race cars who use the latest technology to improve their performance. As Storm's success progresses throughout the season and attracts other rookies, most of the veterans either retire or are dismissed by their sponsors. In the final race of the season at [[Los Angeles]], Lightning starts falling behind Storm after both of them pitted. He tries to keep up, but in doing so suffers a violent crash, leaving him badly injured and ending his worst season on record prematurely, while Storm goes on to win the Piston Cup.\n\nAfter four months of recovery, Lightning decides that he will continue racing and calls his sponsors, Rusty and Dusty Rust-eze, who reveal they have sold Rust-eze to a businessman named Sterling. Sterling assigns Lightning to train under Cruz Ramirez, where he struggles to adapt to the modern training methods. After Lightning accidentally damages a simulator, Sterling tries to force him to retire. Adamant that he can still race, Lightning instead offers that if he wins the upcoming Florida 500, he can decide if he wants to keep racing, otherwise he would retire immediately. Sterling reluctantly accepts the deal.\n\nLightning tries to train on nearby Fireball Beach, but ends up spending most of his time teaching Cruz how to drive on the sand. Lightning then attempts to join a race undercover at a famous dirt track called Thunder Hollow, but inadvertently enters a [[Figure 8 racing|figure-8-style]] [[demolition derby]] with Cruz, which she wins albeit both of them hiding their identities. Lightning's cover is blown when Cruz accidentally swerves to avoid a water truck causing him to tumble over and spilling his water on Lightning, therefore adding to his humiliation.\n\nFrustrated that he'd wasted his time taking care of Cruz, Lightning rages at her and in the process of accidentally breaks her trophy. Cruz reveals that she had wanted to be a racer just like Lightning all her life, but never started a race due to her feeling that she could never be one. She resigns as Lightning's trainer and heads back to the training center. Guilty and with no other options, Lightning calls his friend [[Mater (Cars)|Mater]] for advice. He suggests that Lightning track down [[Doc Hudson]]'s mentor Smokey, in Doc's hometown of [[Thomasville, Georgia]], so Lightning catches up to Cruz and convinces her to rejoin him.\n\nIn Thomasville, Lightning meets up with Smokey, who reveals that despite the fact Doc never raced again, he found new happiness in training Lightning. After Lightning accepts the fact that he will never be as fast as Storm, Smokey and Doc's old friends, Louise \"Barnstormer\" Nash, River Scott, and Junior \"Midnight\" Moon, help Lightning learn new tricks to overcome his speed disadvantage, using Cruz as his [[sparring partner]]. However, during the final practice race, Cruz suddenly overtakes him and he suffers a flashback to his crash, shaking his confidence.\n\nAt the race, Lightning starts at the back, but with assistance from Smokey in the pits, manages to gradually push up the ranks. Sterling, who still believes Lightning can't win, orders Cruz back to the training center to prepare a new racer for the following race, despite her wanting to stay and watch the race. Overhearing the exchange and remembering Cruz's dream of racing, Lightning avoids a massive pile-up and has his crew outfit her to take his place in the race, believing she is the key to defeating Storm. While shaky at first, Cruz is able to push up the ranks thanks to Lightning coaching her from the pits, and eventually ends up right behind Storm. Storm, feeling threatened, tries to intimidate Cruz, even to the point of ramming her against the wall in the final lap. Cruz, using one of Doc's old moves, flips over Storm, overtaking him and winning the race. As Cruz celebrates her victory, Sterling offers her a role on his team, but she instead takes a counteroffer from Dinoco's owner [[List of Cars characters#Tex Dinoco|Tex Dinoco]]. Since Lightning and Cruz were both wearing #95, both have won the race, meaning that Lightning gets to decide if he is done racing.\n\nSome time later, Lightning and Cruz return to [[Radiator Springs]], where Lightning reveals that Tex has bought Rust-eze from Sterling. Lightning, now decked in Doc's old racing colors, decides to continue racing, but trains Cruz first for the season.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Mater is seen singing at his junkyard, and receives a call but accidentally knocks his stand over.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Owen Wilson 2017 Daytona 500.jpg|right|thumb|Owen Wilson served as the grand marshal for the [[2017 Daytona 500]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lawrence |first1=Derek |title=Cars 3 star Owen Wilson to act as Grand Marshal for Daytona 500 |url=https://ew.com/movies/2017/01/19/cars-3-owen-wilson-daytona-500/ |access-date=April 4, 2021 |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=January 19, 2017 |ref=EWGrandMarshal}}</ref>]]\n{{see also|List of Cars characters}}\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as [[Lightning McQueen]],<ref name=\"USATCruzRamirez\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/05/30/sneak-peek-exclusive-cars-3-new-character-cruz-ramirez/84981778/|title=Sneak peek: 'Cars 3' zooms ahead with new character Cruz Ramirez|date=30 May 2016|work=[[USA Today]]|last1=Alexander|first1=Bryan|access-date=23 July 2016}}</ref> a legendary Piston Cup veteran and Sally Carrera's boyfriend. \n* [[Cristela Alonzo]] as [[List of Cars characters#Cruz Ramirez|Cruz Ramirez]],<ref name=\"USATCruzRamirez\" /><ref name=\"EW Voices\" /> Lightning McQueen's trainer.\n* [[Chris Cooper]] as [[List of Cars characters#Smokey|Smokey]],<ref name=\"NASCAR legends\" /> Doc Hudson's former mechanic and crew chief who helps out Lightning and Cruz.\n* [[Nathan Fillion]] as [[List of Cars characters#Sterling \"Rust eze\"|Sterling]],<ref name=\":0\"/> a rich business car and the new Rust-eze team owner.\n* [[Larry the Cable Guy]] as [[Mater (Cars)|Mater]], a jolly [[tow truck]] and Lightning McQueen's best friend.\n* [[Armie Hammer]] as [[List of Cars characters#Jackson Storm|Jackson Storm]],<ref\nname=\"USATCruzRamirez\" /><ref name=\"EW Voices\" /> McQueen's new racing rival.\n* [[Tom and Ray Magliozzi]] as [[List of Cars characters#Rusty and Dusty Rust-eze|Rusty and Dusty Rust-eze]], respectively,<ref name=\"AMKeyCast\" /> the owners of Rust-eze.

Fee said that they \"even talked to a sports psychoanalyst who explained that many of these drivers can't imagine themselves doing anything else\", an idea that resonated with the team.  [[Mike Rich]] said that rookies taking over the sport is a \"kind of endless story in sports\", and compared McQueen to [[Wayne Gretzky]] and [[Misty May-Treanor]] as well as many others. Fee said that \"being a parent became [his] main resource to find and understand the emotion\" in the film's storyline.
