He has put off his dreams of going to art school in order to work and help his older sister Jeanne, his disabled father, and his five-year-old nephew Cody, whom he cares for most of the time as the irresponsible Jeanne spends her time partying. Working as a short-order cook to make ends meet, Zach uses his free time to paint, surf, and hang out with his on/off girlfriend Tori and his best friend Gabe.\n\nWhen Gabe's older brother Shaun comes back home from [[Los Angeles]] for a few weeks, Zach and Shaun develop a close friendship as they go surfing together. Shaun, who is a published writer, encourages Zach to take control of his life and pursue his ambition of going to [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]]. One night after drinking, Shaun kisses Zach. However, Zach is not prepared to give in to his feelings immediately and struggles with whether or not he may be gay. Soon, however, he goes to Shaun's house and the two start making out and spend the night together. Following this, Jeanne reveals her boyfriend Alan is heading to [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] for a job interview and she wants to go with him for the weekend so she needs Zach to look after Cody. Zach is reluctant, but agrees. When Shaun invites him over, he tells him to bring Cody along and the three have a great time together. Zach and Shaun's relationship begins to blossom, while at the same time Shaun builds a strong bond with Cody.\n\nZach feels uncomfortable when both Gabe and Jeanne learn about his relationship with Shaun. Although Gabe is supportive, Jeanne reveals her homophobic opinions and tells Zach that she does not want Cody hanging around Shaun because he is gay. She insists that since Cody's father is no longer in the picture, she needs Zach to be a positive influence and role model for Cody. At a party later that night, Zach becomes conflicted and ends things with Shaun, reasoning that he is not like him. Shaun tells him that it is obvious what he wants and calls him a coward for being too afraid to deal with it.\n\nShaun secretly submits Zach's art school application and Zach is eventually accepted on full scholarship. When Alan gets the job in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Jeanne wants to move there with him permanently but does not want to take Cody. She wants to leave Cody with Zach for the time being. Zach is again forced to decide between putting others first and neglecting his own dreams, as he has always done. Later, he tries to tell Tori about his relationship with Shaun, only to find out she already knows and is supportive. After Zach decides to finally move forward with his art career, he goes to see Shaun and confesses that he had been accepted into the school in the past, but put it off to look after his family after his mother died. Now determined to finally go for what he wants in life, he re-affirms his love for Shaun and the two reconcile, making plans to move in together near the school.\n\nHe then goes to see Jeanne who's preparing to leave with Alan. Zach boldly walks up to her, hand in hand with Shaun, and gives Jeanne an ultimatum. If she wants to leave Cody with him then she will have to accept that Cody will be living with him and Shaun. Jeanne tries to guilt Zach, but he reminds her that she is the one who is abandoning her son, not him. He tells her that Shaun is a good guy who cares about him and Cody, and that a life with them is what is best for Cody. He tells her that he plans on finally making the life he really wants for himself. Jeanne relents, accepting what is truly best for Cody, and leaves him in the care of Zach and Shaun as she goes off to Portland with Alan. The film ends with Zach, Shaun and Cody happily playing on the beach together as a family.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Trevor Wright]] as Zach\n* [[Brad Rowe (actor)|Brad Rowe]] as Shaun\n* [[Tina Holmes]] as Jeanne\n* [[Jackson Wurth (actor)|Jackson Wurth]] as Cody\n* [[Ross Thomas (actor)|Ross Thomas]] as Gabe\n* [[Katie Walder]] as Tori\n* [[Albert Reed (model)|Albert Reed]] as Billy\n* [[Joy Gohring]] as Ellen\n* Matt Bushell as Alan\n* [[Caitlin Crosby]] as Shari\n*[[Raquel Justin]] as blue\n\n==Production==\n''Shelter'' was filmed in 21 days, primarily in [[San Pedro, Los Angeles, California|San Pedro]] and [[Laguna Beach, California|Laguna Beach]], California, with additional shooting in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]] and [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], California.
