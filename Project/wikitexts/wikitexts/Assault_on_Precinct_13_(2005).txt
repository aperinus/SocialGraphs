The cast also includes [[John Leguizamo]], [[Maria Bello]], [[Ja Rule]], [[Drea de Matteo]], [[Brian Dennehy]], and [[Gabriel Byrne]]. It is a [[remake]] of [[John Carpenter]]'s 1976 [[Assault on Precinct 13 (1976 film)|film of the same name]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=August 2021}}\nFollowing a failed sting operation in which two fellow undercover officers are killed months prior, [[Detroit Police Department]] Sergeant Jake Roenick begins to regularly abuse alcohol and painkillers while clinging to his unambitious assignment as a desk sergeant at Precinct 13, which is due to be decommissioned. On New Year's Eve, Roenick, officer Jasper O'Shea, and secretary Iris Ferry maintain a skeleton shift. Psychiatrist Alexandra Sabian arrives to evaluate Roenick's fitness for duty.\n\nCrime boss Marion Bishop is arrested after killing an undercover policeman, and is set to be transferred to prison with three other criminals: Beck, Anna, and Smiley. When a snowstorm shuts down the roads, the prison transport is diverted to Precinct 13, where an unprepared Roenick places the prisoners in cells.\n\nMasked gunmen cut off the precinct's communications and electricity, and attack the station, killing [[Wayne County Sheriff's Office (Michigan)|the deputies]] before demanding that Bishop be handed over. Roenick kills one of the attackers and finds he is an undercover cop working under Captain Marcus Duvall of Precinct 21. Bishop explains that Duvall and his team are corrupt and were formerly his business partners. They now plan to eliminate him to preserve their secret.\n\nThe precinct staff and criminals form an uneasy truce. Heavily outnumbered and outgunned, Roenick releases the prisoners and arms them to help defend the precinct. Their combined efforts repel several more attacks, eventually leading to a stalemate. Another officer, Capra, arrives and is shot at by the corrupt officers, but makes it inside, but Bishop suspects him of being sent by Duvall when he discovers an unlocked back entrance.\n\nBeck and Smiley meanwhile secretly conspire to escape; simultaneously, the rest of the defenders plan for Anna and Sabian to escape in Capra's SUV. When Beck and Smiley sneak out, they are killed by Duvall's men, providing the distraction which allows Anna and Sabian to drive off but they are ambushed by Duvall\u2019s right-hand man Kahane; who kills Anna, having been hiding in the back seat, whilst Duvall kills Sabian after she refuses to cooperate.\n\nWhen the snowfall subsides, Duvall calls in a corrupt [[SWAT]] team who land on the roof of the precinct. The defenders flee through a utilities tunnel underneath the building. Emerging from the tunnel, they find themselves surrounded by Duvall's men. The traitor is revealed to be O'Shea and not Capra. As Duvall prepares to execute the others, Bishop secretly plants a flash bang grenade on O'Shea, mortally wounding him. In the confusion, Iris and Capra flee in Duvall's SUV. Kahane shoots out the tires, causing the vehicle to crash and knock Capra unconscious, but Iris manages to kill Kahane after a struggle.\n\nDuvall chases Roenick and Bishop into a nearby forest where they ambush and kill the remaining forces, however Duvall shoots and wounds Bishop before being killed by Roenick, who is himself injured in the process. Following this, an injured Bishop takes Roenick's gun and flees, and Roenick promises to personally arrest him in the future. When Iris arrives with police and firemen, Roenick claims that only he and Duvall's gang are present, knowing that Bishop can't go too far. As the authorities secure the area, Roenick and Iris leave the forest as the sun rises.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Main cast per closing tombstone credits --->\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Sergeant Jake Roenick\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Marion Bishop\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as Beck\n* [[Maria Bello]] as Dr. Alex Sabian\n* [[Ja Rule|Jeffrey \"Ja Rule\" Atkins]] as Smiley \n* [[Drea de Matteo]] as Iris Ferry\n* [[Matt Craven]] as Officer Kevin Capra\n* [[Brian Dennehy]] as Officer Jasper O'Shea\n* [[Gabriel Byrne]] as Captain Marcus Duvall\n* [[Kim Coates]] as Deputy Rosen\n* [[Dorian Harewood]] as Deputy Gil\n* [[Currie Graham]] as Lieutenant Mike Kahane\n* [[Fulvio Cecere]] as Officer Ray Portnell\n* [[Titus Welliver]] as Milos\n* [[Aisha Hinds]] as Anna\n\n==Production==\n''Assault on Precinct 13'' was mostly filmed on location in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], as well as in [[Ontario]], Canada ([[Toronto]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]).\n\n==Critical reception and box office==\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with a 59% positive rating on ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'', the site's critical consensus being \"This remake has been praised by some as an expertly made [[B-movie]], and dismissed by others as formulaic\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/assault_on_precinct_13/| title=Assault on Precinct 13 Movie Reviews, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | access-date=June 3, 2020}}</ref> and a metascore of 54 on ''[[Metacritic]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/assaultonprecinct13 | title=Assault on Precinct 13 Reviews at Metacritic.com | website=[[Metacritic]] | access-date=2009-10-19}}</ref>\n\n''Assault on Precinct 13'' grossed $35.3 million worldwide on a budget of $30 million.<ref name=\"bom\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=assaultonprecinct13.htm| title=Assault on Precinct 13 (2005) - Box Office Mojo | access-date=2009-10-19}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of American films of 2005]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0398712|title=Assault on Precinct 13}}\n*{{Metacritic film|title=Assault on Precinct 13}}\n*{{Rotten-tomatoes|id=assault_on_precinct_13|title=Assault on Precinct 13}}\n*{{mojo title|id=assaultonprecinct13|title=Assault on Precinct 13}}\n\n{{Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Richet}}\n{{James DeMonaco}}\n{{John Carpenter}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Assault On Precinct 13}}\n[[Category:2005 films]]\n[[Category:2005 action thriller films]]\n[[Category:American action thriller films]]\n[[Category:Remakes of American films]]\n[[Category:English-language French films]]\n[[Category:French action thriller films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Fictional portrayals of the Detroit Police Department]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Richet]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Graeme Revell]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2004]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2005]]\n[[Category:Films set in Detroit]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Detroit]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Hamilton, Ontario]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Toronto]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by James DeMonaco]]\n[[Category:Films set around New Year]]\n[[Category:Rogue (company) films]]\n[[Category:Siege films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]"}]}}}}
