The film stars [[Melanie Griffith]] as an abused housewife who becomes an actress, while her nephew deals with a racially motivated murder involving a corrupt sheriff. It marked [[Dakota Johnson]]'s film debut.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1965 [[Alabama]], Peter Joseph \"Peejoe\" Bullis lives in a small town at the height of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Peejoe's eccentric Aunt Lucille Vinson kills her husband Chester with poison, after suffering years of abuse. She decapitates him and brings his severed head with her en route to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], where she is convinced that television stardom awaits her. In [[New Orleans]], Lucille buys a black hat box to store Chester's head. When a bartender on [[Bourbon Street]] insults her, she threatens him with a [[revolver]] and robs the cash register before stealing his car. Back in Alabama, Peejoe's uncle (Lucille's brother), Dove, a local funeral director, is notified of the incident. While traveling, Lucille becomes increasingly paranoid, convincing Chester's ghost is haunting her.\n\nMeanwhile, Peejoe becomes involved with a group of black students protesting the town's [[Jim Crow laws|racially segregated municipal swimming pool]], leading to a protest that explodes into deadly violence. A young black boy, Taylor Jackson, is killed by the town sheriff, John Doggett. Peejoe, the only witness, is pressured by the sheriff to keep it quiet. While mowing his lawn, Peejoe is struck in the eye with a rock; the townspeople circulate a false story that he was shot in retaliation for Taylor's death. The black townspeople stage a protest honoring Taylor in which they enter the swimming pool. Peejoe and his brother, Wiley, join them in support, but the protest is interrupted by police and white pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederates]].\n\nLucille wins $32,000 in [[Las Vegas]] while playing [[roulette]] at a casino, and subsequently pays for a personal driver, Norman, to bring her to Los Angeles. She arrives in Hollywood, taking the stage name Carolyn Clay, and manages to land a minor role on ''[[Bewitched]]''. Back in Alabama, Peejoe and Wiley attend a speech by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and Peejoe's racist aunt Earline grows infuriated over the publicity involving the family. While watching television one night, they are all surprised to see Lucille on television.\n\nAt an industry party in the [[Hollywood Hills]], hostess Joan Blake discovers Chester's severed head in Lucille's hat box. Lucille flees with Norman to [[San Francisco]], and tries to get rid of the head by throwing it off the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. Two policemen, thinking she is attempting suicide, stop her and discover the head. She is arrested and escorted back to Alabama for her trial, where she is met by a [[media circus]]. In the local jail, Lucille is incarcerated in a cell next to Nehemiah Jackson, Taylor's father who has been jailed over the protest.\n\nAfter being convicted of [[first-degree murder]], Lucille is sentenced to twenty years in prison. However, the sentence is suspended when she earns the judge's sympathies after testifying to the abuse she received, and she is put on a five-year probation with the condition that she seek psychiatric help. Lucille, her children, and all her friends joyfully exit the courtroom while the sheriff (through Peejoe's testimony) is put under arrest for Taylor's murder.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Melanie Griffith]] as Lucille Vinson\n*[[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]] as Dove Bullis\n*[[Lucas Black]] as Peter Joseph Bullis\n*David Speck as Wiley Bullis\n*[[Cathy Moriarty]] as Earlene Bullis\n*[[Meat Loaf]] as Sheriff John Doggett\n*[[Rod Steiger]] as Judge Louis Mead\n*[[Richard Schiff]] as Norman\n*[[John Beasley (actor)|John Beasley]] as Nehemiah Jackson\n*Louis Miller as Taylor Jackson\n*[[Robert Wagner]] as Harry Hall\n*[[Noah Emmerich]] as Sheriff Raymond\n*[[Sandra Seacat]] as Meemaw\n*[[Paul Ben-Victor]] as D.A.
