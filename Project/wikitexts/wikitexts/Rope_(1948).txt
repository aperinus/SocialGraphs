They commit the crime as an intellectual exercise: they want to prove their superiority by committing the \"[[Perfect crime|perfect murder]]\".\n\nAfter hiding the body in a large [[Cassone|antique wooden chest]], Brandon and Phillip host a dinner party at the apartment, which has a panoramic view of Manhattan's skyline. The guests, who are unaware of what has happened, include the victim's father, Mr. Kentley, and aunt, Mrs. Atwater; his mother is unable to attend because of a cold. Also present are David's fianc\u00e9e, Janet Walker, and her former lover, Kenneth Lawrence, who was once David's close friend.\n[[File:Annex - Stewart, James (Call Northside 777) 01.jpg|left|thumb|[[James Stewart]], the actor who plays Rupert Cadell in the film]]\nBrandon uses the chest containing the body as a buffet table for the food, just before their housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson, arrives to help with the party.\n\nBrandon and Phillip's idea for the murder was inspired years earlier by conversations with their prep-school housemaster, publisher Rupert Cadell. While they were at school, Rupert had discussed with them, in an apparently approving way, the intellectual concepts of [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s [[\u00dcbermensch|Superman]], as a means of showing one's superiority over others. He, too, is among the guests at the party since Brandon, in particular, thinks that he would approve of their \"work of art.\"\n\nBrandon's subtle hints about David's absence indirectly lead to a discussion on the \"art of murder.\" Brandon appears calm and in control, although when he first speaks to Rupert, he is nervously excited and stammering. Phillip, on the other hand, is visibly upset and morose. He does not conceal it well and starts to drink too much.\n\nWhen David's aunt, Mrs. Atwater, who fancies herself a fortune-teller, tells him that his hands will bring him great fame, she refers to his skill at the piano, but he appears to think this refers to the notoriety of being a strangler.\n\nHowever, much of the conversation focuses on David and his strange absence, which worries the guests. A suspicious Rupert quizzes a fidgety Phillip about this and some of the inconsistencies raised in conversation. For example, Phillip vehemently denies ever strangling a chicken at the Shaws' farm, although Rupert has seen Phillip strangle several. Phillip later complains to Brandon about having had a \"rotten evening,\" not because of David's murder, but because of Rupert's questioning.\n\nAs the evening goes on, David's father and fianc\u00e9e begin to worry because he has neither arrived nor phoned. Brandon increases the tension by playing matchmaker between Janet and Kenneth.\n\nMrs. Kentley calls, overwrought because she has not heard from David, and Mr. Kentley decides to leave. He takes with him some books Brandon has given him, tied together with the rope Brandon and Phillip used to strangle his son.\n\nWhen Rupert leaves, Mrs. Wilson accidentally hands him David's monogrammed hat, further arousing his suspicion. Rupert returns to the apartment a short while after everyone else has departed, pretending that he has left his cigarette case behind. He asks for a drink and then stays to theorize about David's disappearance.\n\nHe is encouraged by Brandon, who hopes Rupert will understand and even applaud them. A drunk Phillip, unable to bear it anymore, throws a glass and accuses Rupert of playing cat-and-mouse games with him and Brandon.\n\nRupert seizes Brandon's gun from Phillip and insists on examining the chest over Brandon's objections. He lifts the lid of the chest and finds the body inside. He is horrified and ashamed, realizing that Brandon and Phillip used his own rhetoric to rationalize murder.\n\nRupert disavows all his previous talk of superiority and inferiority and fires several shots out the window to attract attention. As the police arrive, Rupert sits on a chair next to the chest, Phillip begins to play the piano, and Brandon continues to drink.\n\n== Cast ==\n<gallery>\nFile:James Stewart in Rope trailer.jpg|[[James Stewart]] as Rupert Cadell\nFile:John Dall in Rope trailer.jpg|[[John Dall]] as Brandon Shaw\nFile:Farley Granger 1951 press photo.jpg|[[Farley Granger]] (Phillip Morgan)\n</gallery>\n<gallery>\nFile:Joan Chandler in Rope trailer.jpg|[[Joan Chandler]] as Janet Walker\nFile:Cedric Hardwicke in Rope trailer.jpg|Sir [[Cedric Hardwicke]] as Mr. Henry Kentley\nFile:Constance Collier in Rope trailer.jpg|[[Constance Collier]] as Mrs. Anita Atwater\nFile:Douglas Dick in Rope trailer.jpg|[[Douglas Dick]] as Kenneth Lawrence\nFile:Edith Evanson in Rope trailer.jpg|[[Edith Evanson]] as Mrs. Wilson\nFile:DickHogan.ShedNoTears.1948.jpg|[[Dick Hogan]] as David Kentley\n</gallery>\n\n== Production ==\nThe film is one of Hitchcock's most experimental and \"one of the most interesting experiments ever attempted by a major director working with big box-office names\",<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite news |date=June 15, 1984 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=Rope |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/rope-1948 | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |access-date=November 8, 2020 }}</ref> abandoning many standard film techniques to allow for the long unbroken scenes. Each shot ran continuously for up to ten minutes (the camera's film capacity) without interruption. It was shot on a single set, aside from the opening [[establishing shot]] street scene under the credits. Camera moves were carefully planned and there was almost no editing.\n\nThe walls of the set were on rollers and could silently be moved out of the way to make way for the camera and then replaced when they were to come back into the shot. Prop men constantly had to move the furniture and other props out of the way of the large [[Technicolor]] camera, and then ensure they were replaced in the correct location. A team of soundmen and camera operators kept the camera and microphones in constant motion, as the actors kept to a carefully choreographed set of cues.<ref name=truffaut>{{cite book |last=Truffaut |first=Fran\u00e7ois |author-link=Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut |title=Hitchcock/Truffaut |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |year=1967}}</ref>\n\nThis filming technique, which conveys the impression of continuous action, also serves to lengthen the duration of the action in the mind of the viewer. In a 2002 article in ''[[Scientific American]]'', [[Antonio Damasio]] argues that the time frame covered by the movie, which lasts 80 minutes and is supposed to be in \"real time\", is actually longer\u2014a little more than 100 minutes. This, he states, is accomplished by speeding up the action: the formal dinner lasts only 20 minutes, the sun sets too quickly, and so on.<ref>Damasio, Antonio.

On these changeovers, Hitchcock cuts to a new camera setup, deliberately not disguising the cut.

As the guests are escorted to the door, actors Joan Chandler and Douglas Dick stop to have a few words and the sign flashes in the background several times.\n\nThere is some debate as to whether Hitchcock makes another cameo earlier in the film.
