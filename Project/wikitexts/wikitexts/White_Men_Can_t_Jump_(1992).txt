It stars [[Wesley Snipes]] and [[Woody Harrelson]] as [[streetball]] [[Hustling|hustlers]]. The film was released in the United States on March 27, 1992, by [[20th Century Fox]].\n\n==Plot==\nBilly Hoyle is a former college basketball player who makes a \nliving by hustling [[streetball]]ers who assume he cannot play well because he is white. Sidney Deane is a talented but cocky player who is twice beaten by Billy, once in a half-court team game and later in a one-on-one shootout for money.\n\nBilly and his live-in girlfriend, Gloria Clemente, are on the run from the Stucci brothers, mobsters to whom he owes a gambling debt. A voracious reader, Gloria makes note of obscure facts. Gloria's goal in life is to be a contestant on the television game show ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' and make a fortune. Sidney wants to rent a house for his family outside the rough [[Baldwin Village, Los Angeles|Baldwin Village]] neighborhood. He proposes a business partnership with Billy where they will hustle other players by deliberately setting them up to pick Billy as Sidney's teammate. At first, their system is very successful, but when they unexpectedly lose a game, it turns out that Sidney had double-crossed Billy by deliberately playing badly to avenge his earlier loss to him, causing Billy to lose $1,700 to a group of Sidney's friends.\n\nGloria, who wants Billy to find a stable job, is incensed at Billy for blowing his money again, but realizes he was hustled after Billy tells her how it happened. They go to Sidney's apartment and appeal to his wife Rhonda. The women agree to share the money, provided Sidney and Billy team up for a major two-on-two outdoor tournament. Despite their constant bickering, Sidney and Billy win the tournament and the grand prize of $5,000, largely due to Billy's ability to disrupt his opponents' concentration. Billy's most notable claim is that he is \"[[Flow (psychology)|in the zone]]\", a state of mind in which nothing can distract him. Sidney is pleased with the outcome, but he cannot help mocking Billy about his inability to [[slam dunk]].\n\nBilly insists that he can indeed dunk, and after Sidney disagrees, Billy offers to bet his share of the $5,000 on his ability to dunk. Sidney gives him three chances, telling him \"white men can't jump\". Billy fails and squanders his share. When he tells Gloria, she leaves him. Desperate to get her back, Billy goes to Sidney for help. Sidney reveals that he has a friend who works as a security guard at the TV studio that produces ''Jeopardy!'' His friend, Robert, agrees to use his connections to get her on the show if Billy can sink a hook shot from beyond the half-court line, which he does. Gloria initially stumbles over sports questions (such as naming [[Babe Ruth]] as the [[Wilt Chamberlain|all-time NBA rebound leader]]), but makes a comeback with a pet topic, \"Foods That Begin With the Letter Q\". She wins $14,100 on her first episode.\n\nBilly sings Gloria a song he has composed and wins her back. As Billy and Gloria discuss their new future, Sidney is desperate for Billy's help. His apartment was burglarized and his winnings were stolen. He and Rhonda are desperate for money so they can move to a better neighborhood. Gloria is expecting Billy to get a steady job and settle down, but Sidney informs him that two hoops legends of the L.A. streetball scene, \"The King\" and \"The Duck\", are playing at the courts downtown. Sidney asks Billy to partner with him to play against them. Billy enthusiastically agrees, offering to gamble his share of Gloria's take. Gloria warns that if Billy gambles with her money, they are through, regardless of the outcome. Billy sides with Sidney, feeling he must honor the obligation he owes Sidney for getting Gloria on ''Jeopardy!''. They play a final game against King and Duck. In a very tight game, Sidney and Billy prevail, the winning point coming when Sidney lobs an [[Alley-oop (basketball)|\"alley-oop\" pass]] to Billy, who dunks it.\n\nReturning home happy for having doubled the share that Gloria gave him of her winnings, Billy is crushed to find that Gloria has kept her word and left him for good. The mobsters who are after Billy track him down, and he pays off his debts. Billy then asks Sidney to set him up with a real job, and Sidney remarks that Billy and Gloria may be better off without each other. The film ends as Billy and Sidney launch into yet another basketball argument and return to the court where they first met to play a one-on-one game, this time as friends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as Sidney \"Syd\" Deane \n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as Billy Hoyle\n* [[Rosie Perez]] as Gloria Clemente\n* [[Tyra Ferrell]] as Rhonda Deane\n* [[Cylk Cozart]] as Robert\n* [[Kadeem Hardison]] as Junior\n* Ernest Harden, Jr. as George\n* [[Nigel Miguel]] as Dwight \"The Flight\" McGhee\n* [[Freeman Williams]] as Duck Johnson\n* [[Louis Price]] as Eddie \"The King\" Faroo\n* [[Marques Johnson]] as Raymond\n* [[Alex Trebek]] as Himself\n* Allan Malamud as Rocket Scientist\n* [[Duane Martin]] as Willie Lewis\n* David Roberson as TJ\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n{{no footnotes|section|date=June 2022}}\n[[Bob Lanier]], Detroit Pistons and Milwaukee Bucks player and Hall of Famer, was hired as basketball coach for the film.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Lanier was impressed with Harrelson and Snipes, suggesting both reached a Division II college basketball skill level.
