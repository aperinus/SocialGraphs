It is based on the 1924 stage play ''[[Dracula (1924 play)|Dracula]]'' by [[Hamilton Deane]] and [[John L.

It has had a notable influence on popular culture, and Lugosi's portrayal of Dracula established the character as a [[cultural icon]], as well as the archetypal vampire in later works of fiction.

The local village people fear that vampires inhabit the castle and warn Renfield not to go there. Renfield refuses to stay at the village inn and asks his carriage driver to take him to the Borgo Pass. He is driven to the castle by Dracula's coach, with Dracula disguised as the driver. En route, Renfield sticks his head out the window to ask the driver to slow down but sees the driver has disappeared; a bat leads the horses.\n\nRenfield enters the castle and is welcomed by the charming but eccentric Count, who, unbeknownst to Renfield, is a [[vampire]]. They discuss Dracula's intention to lease Carfax Abbey in England, where he intends to travel the next day. Dracula hypnotizes Renfield into opening a window. Renfield faints as a bat appears, and Dracula's three wives close in on him. Dracula waves them away, then attacks Renfield himself.\n\nAboard the [[schooner]] ''Vesta'', Renfield has become a raving lunatic slave to Dracula, who hides in a coffin and feeds on the ship's crew. When the ship reaches England, Renfield is discovered to be the only living person. He is sent to Dr. Seward's [[sanatorium]] adjoining Carfax Abbey. Elsewhere, at a [[London]] theatre, Dracula meets Seward. Seward introduces his daughter Mina, her fianc\u00e9 John Harker, and a family friend, Lucy Weston. Lucy is fascinated by Dracula. That night, Dracula enters her room and feasts on her blood while she sleeps. She dies the next day after a string of [[blood transfusion]]s.\n\nRenfield is obsessed with eating flies and spiders. Polymath doctor Professor Van Helsing analyzes his blood and discovers his obsession. He starts talking about vampires, and that afternoon, Renfield begs Seward to send him away, claiming his nightly cries may disturb Mina's dreams. When Dracula calls Renfield through the medium of a wolf howling, Renfield is disturbed by Van Helsing showing him [[Aconitum|wolfsbane]], which Van Helsing says is used for protection from vampires.\n\nDracula visits Mina, asleep in her bedroom, and bites her. The next evening, he enters for a visit, and Van Helsing and Harker notice that he does not have a mirror reflection. When Van Helsing reveals this to Dracula, he smashes the mirror and leaves. Van Helsing deduces that Dracula is the vampire behind the recent tragedies.\n\nMina leaves her room and runs to Dracula in the garden, where he attacks her. The maid finds her. Newspapers report that a woman in white is luring children from the park and biting them. Mina recognizes the lady as Lucy, risen as a vampire. Harker wants to take Mina to London for safety but is convinced to leave her with Van Helsing. Van Helsing orders Nurse Briggs to take care of Mina when she sleeps and not to remove the wreath of wolfsbane from her neck.\n\nRenfield escapes from his cell and listens to the men discussing vampires. Before he is taken back to his cell, Renfield relates to them how Dracula convinced Renfield to allow him to enter the sanatorium by promising him thousands of rats full of blood and life. Dracula enters the Seward parlor and talks with Van Helsing. He states that Mina now belongs to him and warns Van Helsing to return to his home country. Van Helsing swears to excavate Carfax Abbey and destroy Dracula. Dracula attempts to hypnotize Van Helsing, but the latter's resolve proves stronger. As Dracula lunges at Van Helsing, he draws a [[crucifix]] from his coat, forcing Dracula to retreat.\n\nHarker visits Mina on a terrace, and she speaks of how much she loves \"nights and fogs\". A bat flies above them and squeaks to Mina. She then attacks Harker, but Van Helsing and Seward save him. Mina confesses what Dracula has done to her and tells Harker their love is finished.\n\nDracula hypnotizes Briggs into removing the wolfsbane from Mina's neck and opening the windows. Van Helsing and Harker see Renfield heading for Carfax Abbey. Arriving there, they see Dracula with Mina. When Harker shouts to Mina, Dracula thinks Renfield has betrayed him by leading them there and kills him. Dracula is hunted by Van Helsing and Harker, who know that Dracula is forced to sleep in his coffin during daylight, and the sun is rising. Van Helsing prepares a wooden stake while Harker searches for Mina. Van Helsing impales Dracula through the heart, killing him, and Mina returns to normal.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Count Dracula]]\n* [[Helen Chandler]] as [[Mina Harker|Mina Seward]]\n* [[David Manners]] as [[Jonathan Harker|John Harker]]\n* [[Dwight Frye]] as [[Renfield]]\n* [[Edward Van Sloan]] as [[Abraham Van Helsing|Van Helsing]]\n* [[Herbert Bunston]] as [[John Seward|Dr. Seward]]\n* [[Frances Dade]] as [[Lucy Westenra|Lucy Weston]]\n* [[Joan Standing]] as Nurse Briggs (in an error on the [[opening credits]], she is misidentified as \"Maid\")<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n* [[Charles K.

W. Murnau]]. Stoker's widow sued for [[plagiarism]] and [[copyright infringement]], and the courts decided in her favor, essentially ordering that all [[release print|prints]] of ''Nosferatu'' be destroyed.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Enthusiastic young Hollywood producer [[Carl Laemmle, Jr.]] also saw the box office potential in Stoker's gothic chiller, and he legally acquired the novel's film rights. Initially, he wanted ''Dracula'' to be a spectacle on a scale with the lavish silent films ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1923) and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925).\n\nUniversal Pictures paid $40,000 for all rights to the novel and the stage plays, so they would have the exclusive rights to the Dracula character. Universal also brought Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist [[Louis Bromfield]] to pen the script to fit this grand scale vision. Bromfield tried to reconcile novel and the stage play and in his draft suggested that Dracula should be two people\u2014ghoulish old man at the beginning of the film, who by traveling to London and feeding on blood gets rejuvenated into drawing-room Dracula of the theatre. Jonathan Harker was supposed to travel to Transylvania in the opening scenes of the film. As in the stage play, Dracula was supposed to kiss Mina passionately on the lips. Those things never made it into movie, either because they were considered too expensive, were replaced by rewritten scenes, or were deemed too risky. Bromfield was soon replaced with [[Garrett Fort]].<ref>Arthur Lennig (2013): The Immortal Count: The Life and Films of Bela Lugosi</ref>\nFort turned to the stage play. Already a huge hit on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], the Deane/Balderston ''Dracula'' play would end up becoming the blueprint as the production gained momentum. The screenwriters also carefully studied the silent, unauthorized version, [[F. W. Murnau]]'s ''[[Nosferatu]]'', for inspiration. Lifted directly from a nearly identical scene in ''Nosferatu'' that does not appear in Stoker's novel, was the early scene at the Count's castle when Renfield accidentally pricks his finger on a paper clip and it starts to bleed. Dracula creeps toward him with glee, only to be repelled when the crucifix falls in front of the bleeding finger.\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 260\n   | footer    = Colorized lobby cards of [[Edward Van Sloan]] as [[Van Helsing]] confronting [[Bela Lugosi]] in ''Dracula''. \n   | image1    = Dracula1931BelaLugosiColorCrop.jpg\n   | image2    = Dracula1931BelaLugosiColor.png \n   | image3    = \n}}\nThe film was originally intended for [[Lon Chaney]], who would play both the Count and the Professor\u2014a stunt he had performed in several silent films. On his sudden death, casting the title role proved problematic. Initially, Laemmle was not at all interested in Lugosi, in spite of good reviews for his stage portrayal. Laemmle instead considered other actors, including [[Paul Muni]], [[Chester Morris]], [[Ian Keith]], [[John Wray (actor)|John Wray]], [[Joseph Schildkraut]], [[Arthur Edmund Carewe]], [[William Courtenay (actor)|William Courtenay]], [[John Carradine]], and [[Conrad Veidt]]. [[Lew Ayres]] was eventually hired to play Dracula, only to be recast with [[Robert Ames (actor)|Robert Ames]] after being cast in a different role in a different Universal Pictures film.

He was mysterious and never really said anything to the other members of the cast except good morning when he arrived and good night when he left. He was polite, but always distant\".<ref name=\"Gregory William Mank 2009\">Gregory William Mank (2009):''Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff: The Expanded Story of a Haunting Collaboration, with a Complete Filmography of Their Films Together''</ref> Lugosi struck Manners as a vain, eccentric performer: \"I never thought he was acting, but being the odd man he was\".<ref>Skal, David J. (2004). ''Hollywood Gothic: The Tangled Web of Dracula from Novel to Stage to Screen''</ref> [[Edward Van Sloan]], who played Van Helsing on Broadway stage opposite Lugosi, reprised his role on screen. The actor wondered why the film version reduced the large mirror used in the play to the small cigarette box with a mirrored lid.<ref name=\"Gregory William Mank 2009\" /> Despite Van Helsing becoming one of his most famous screen roles Van Sloan didn't think much about the film - in a letter to his nephew he once wrote: \"That reminds me of your failure to see the Dracula film on TV. How lucky you were.... What must it be like today...! Overplayed \u2014 over-written \u2014 altogether lousy\".<ref name=\"Gregory William Mank 2009\"/> Bernard Jukes, who played the role of Renfield in the play on Broadway and during the 1928 tour, wanted that part in the film, but it went to [[Dwight Frye]] instead.<ref>Arthur Lennig (2013): ''The Immortal Count: The Life and Films of Bela Lugosi''</ref>\n\nTod Browning remembered actress [[Helen Chandler]] from the 1928 Broadway play ''The Silent House'' and based on that maiden performance chose her for Mina, the heroine, who becomes mistress to Bela Lugosi\u2019s Count Dracula.<ref name=\"Gregory William Mank 2015\"/> Her salary was $750 per week, making her the highest paid member of the cast. At the time of the filming she already battled severe alcoholism. She was known to laugh at the Lugosi's mirror ritual at the shooting at times. Like some of her co-stars, despite this role becoming her most famous one, she didn't care much about it: \"It would be an awful fate, for instance, to go around being a pale little girl in a trance with her arms outstretched as in ''Dracula'', all the rest of my screen career!\"<ref name=\"Gregory William Mank 2015\"/>\n\nThe peasants at the beginning are praying in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and the signs in the village are also in Hungarian. This was because when Bram Stoker wrote the original novel, the [[Tihu\u021ba Pass|Borgo Pass]] in [[Transylvania]] was then part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and within the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. By the time the film was made, Transylvania had been part of the [[Kingdom of Romania]] since the end of [[World War I]] in 1918.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/41-things-we-learned-from-the-dracula-commentary-a2ad7521e92a/|title=41 Things We Learned from the 'Dracula' Commentary|last=Carr|first=Kevin|date=October 9, 2014|website=[[Film School Rejects]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe scenes of crew members on the ship struggling in the violent storm were lifted from a Universal silent film, ''The Storm Breaker'' (1925). Photographed at [[silent film#Projection speed|silent film projection speed]], this accounts for the jerky, sped-up appearance of the footage when projected at 24 frames per second sound film speed and cobbled together with new footage of Dracula and Renfield.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> [[Jack Foley (sound effects)|Jack Foley]] himself was the [[foley artist]] who produced the sound effects.<ref>Jackson, Blair (September 1, 2005) [http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_foley_recording/ \"Foley Recording\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629141111/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_foley_recording/ |date=June 29, 2011}} ''Mix'' (magazine), accessed July 1, 2010</ref> The picture was completed for a total cost of $341,191.20, which was under the original estimate of $355,050.<ref name=\"AFI film-7690\"/>\n\nBefore the film was even released, Lugosi worried that it would cause him to be [[Typecasting|type cast]]. He reportedly rejected an offer to reprise his role as Dracula in another stage tour of the play, stating: \"No! Not at any price.

Dracula's transition from bat to person is always done off-camera. The film also employs extended periods of silence and character close-ups for dramatic effect, and employs two expository [[intertitles]] and a closeup of a newspaper article to advance the story, a seeming holdover from [[silent film]]s; a point made by online [[film critic]] [[James Berardinelli]]<ref>[http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/d/dracula31.html Review (2000)] by [[James Berardinelli]] at ReelViews.net</ref> is that the actors' performance style seems to belong to the silent era. Director [[Tod Browning]] had a solid reputation as a silent film director, having made them since 1915, including ten horror blockbusters with [[Lon Chaney]] including the masterpiece ''[[The Unknown (1927 film)|The Unknown]]'' (1927), but he never felt completely at ease with sound films.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> He only directed six more films over an eight-year period, the best known being the notorious ''[[Freaks (1932 film)|Freaks]]'', a horror film with [[Olga Baclanova]] and a cast of actual carnival freaks that was yanked from distribution immediately but is a cult favorite today. Browning directed his last film in 1939.\n\n==Music==\nOwing to the costs of adding an original musical score to a film's soundtrack, no score had ever been composed specifically for the film.<ref name=ebert /> The music heard during the opening credits, an excerpt from Act II of [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Swan Lake]]'', was re-used in 1932 for another Universal horror film, ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]''. During the theatre scene where Dracula meets Dr. Seward, Harker, Mina, and Lucy, the end of the overture to [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg]]'' can also be heard as well as the dark opening of [[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|Schubert's \"Unfinished Symphony\" in B minor]].\n\n===1998 score===\nIn 1998, composer [[Philip Glass]] was commissioned to compose a musical score for the classic film. The score was performed by the [[Kronos Quartet]]<ref name=ebert /> under the direction of Michael Reisman, Glass's usual conductor.\n\nOf the project, Glass said: \"The film is considered a classic. I felt the score needed to evoke the feeling of the world of the 19th century \u2014 for that reason I decided a string quartet would be the most evocative and effective. I wanted to stay away from the obvious effects associated with horror films. With [the Kronos Quartet] we were able to add depth to the emotional layers of the film\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-aug-26-ca-3726-story.html|title=Lugosi's 'Dracula' and 'Living Dead' Get a Jump on Halloween|last=King|first=Susan|date=August 26, 1999|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=January 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe film, with this new score, was released by [[Universal Studios]] in 1999 in the [[VHS]] format.

In spite of the literary credentials of the source material, it was uncertain if an American audience was prepared for a serious full length supernatural chiller. Though American audiences had been exposed to other chillers before, such as ''[[The Cat and the Canary (1927 film)|The Cat and the Canary]]'' (1927), this was a horror story with no comic relief or trick ending that downplayed the supernatural. Despite this, ''Dracula'' proved to be a box office success.\n\nWhen the film finally premiered at the [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theatre]] in New York City on February 12, 1931 (released two days later throughout the U.S.),<ref name=\"Sin42\" /> newspapers reported that members of the audiences fainted in shock at the horror on screen.

Universal in particular would become the forefront of early horror cinema, with a canon of films including ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1932), ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' (1933), ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935), and ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' (1941).\n\nFive years after the original release, Universal released ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'' (1936), a direct [[sequel]] that starts immediately after the end of the first film. A second sequel, ''[[Son of Dracula (1943 film)|Son of Dracula]]'' (1943), starring [[Lon Chaney Jr.]], followed another seven years later. The Count returned to life in three more Universal films of the mid-1940s: ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' (1944); ''[[House of Dracula]]'' (1945); and the comedy ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948).\n\nUniversal would only cast Lugosi as Dracula in one more film, the aforesaid [[Abbott and Costello]] vehicle,{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1977|p=60}} giving the role to [[John Carradine]] for the mid-1940s \"monster rally\" films, although Carradine admittedly more closely resembled Stoker's physical description from the book. Many of the familiar images of Dracula are from stills of the older Lugosi made during the filming of the 1948 comedy, so there remain two confusingly distinct incarnations of Lugosi as Dracula, seventeen years apart in age.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}\n\nAs Lugosi played a vampire in three other movies during his career (''[[Mark of the Vampire]]'' (1935), ''[[The Return of the Vampire]]'' (1943), and ''[[Mother Riley Meets the Vampire]]'' (1952){{sfn|Fitzgerald|1977|p=60}}), this contributed to the public misconception that he portrayed Dracula on film many times, although the other vampire roles had him playing Dracula in all but name.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}\n\nSince its release, ''Dracula'' has become widely regarded as a classic of the era and of its genre. In 2000, it was selected for preservation in the U.S. [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref> It was also ranked 79th on [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]]'s countdown of ''[[The 100 Scariest Movie Moments]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.listsofbests.com/list/2948-100-scariest-movie-moments?page=2|title=Parhaat Netticasinot ja esittelyt \u2013 Tutustu ja lunasta suosituimmat casinobonukset!|website=Parhaat Netticasinot ja esittelyt|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104053809/http://www.listsofbests.com/list/2948-100-scariest-movie-moments?page=2|archive-date=November 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nTo many film lovers and critics alike, Lugosi's portrayal is widely regarded as the definitive Dracula. Lugosi had a powerful presence and authority on-screen. The slow, deliberate pacing of his performance (\"I bid you\u2026 welcome!\" and \"I never drink\u2026 wine!\") gave his Dracula the air of a walking, talking corpse, which terrified the movie audiences at the time, compelling with no dialogue, and the many close-ups of Lugosi's face in icy silence jumped off the screen. With this mesmerizing performance, Dracula became Bela Lugosi's signature role, his Dracula a [[cultural icon]], and he himself a legend in the classic [[Universal Horror]] film series.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}\n\nHowever, Dracula would ultimately become a role which would prove to be both a blessing and a curse. Despite his earlier stage successes in a variety of roles, from the moment Lugosi donned the cape on screen, it would forever see him [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as the Count.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bela Lugosi in Person|last1=Kaffenberger| first1=William M.

I was so disappointed. I absolutely had been wanting to see it for a long, long time. There are aspects of it, for instance, that I considered ridiculous. Dracula is played too nice at the beginning. Practically no menace in the character .. There is no shock or fright in it. Lugosi\u2019s hands too ... He held them out stiffly... making him look like a puppet. His smile was not always sinister, either\".<ref name=\"Gary Don Rhodes 2006 p.305\">Gary Don Rhodes (2006): ''Lugosi: His Life in Films, on Stage, and in the Hearts of Horror Lovers'', p.305</ref> While thinking that Lugosi was in his younger days a wonderful looking man, who had tremendous presence and personality, Lee also thought that Lugosi \"was not the right man to play Dracula from the point of view of nationality. Because Transylvania is in Romania and he was a Hungarian from the town of Lugos, hence his name\".<ref name=\"Gary Don Rhodes 2006 p.305\"/> At the time that Bram Stoker wrote the novel, however, Transylvania was part of the Kingdom of Hungary and [[Vlad Dracul]], the original historical inspiration for the novel, was Transylvanian.\n\n[[Gary Oldman]], who played Dracula in [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s [[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|adaptation]], considered Lugosi to be his favourite Dracula and said about his performance: \"He was really on to something: the way he moved, the way he sounded\". Oldman based his Dracula voice on Lugosi's voice.<ref>Roxana Stuart (1997): \"Stage Blood: Vampires of the 19th Century Stage\", p.239</ref>\n\n===Posters===\nThe film's poster campaign was overseen by Universal advertising art director [[Karoly Grosz (illustrator)|Karoly Grosz]], who also illustrated the \"insert\" poster himself.{{sfn|Rebello|Allen|1988|p=217}} Original posters from the 1931 release are scarce and highly valuable to collectors.

Balderston|Balderston]], contributed much of Dracula's popular [[iconography]], much of which vastly differs from Stoker's novel. In the novel and in the German silent film ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922), Dracula's appearance is repulsive; Lugosi portrays the Count as a handsome, charming [[Nobility|nobleman]]. The Deane-Balderston play and this film also introduced the now iconic images of Dracula entering his victims' bedrooms through French doors/windows, wrapping his satin-lined cape around victims, and more emphasis on Dracula transforming into a bat. In the Stoker novel, he variously transformed into a bat or a wolf,<ref name=\"DVD\" /> [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/345/345-h/345-h.htm#CHAPTER_XVIII a mist or \"elemental dust\".]\n\nThe now classic Dracula line, \"I never drink ... wine\", is original to this film.

When the play was revived on Broadway in 1977 starring [[Frank Langella]], the line was added to the script.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\n==Home media==\nIn the 1990s, [[MCA/Universal Home Video]] released
