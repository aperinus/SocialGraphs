An international co-production between the United States, Portugal, France, and Spain, the film is loosely based upon [[Arturo P\u00e9rez-Reverte]]'s 1993 novel ''[[The Club Dumas]]''. The plot involves authenticating a rare and ancient book that purportedly contains a magical secret for summoning the [[Devil]].\n\nThe premiere showing was at [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]], Spain, on 25 August 1999, a month before the 47th [[San Sebastian International Film Festival]]. Though critically and commercially unsuccessful in North America, where reviewers compared it unfavorably with Polanski's supernatural film ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), ''The Ninth Gate'' earned a worldwide gross of $58.4 million against a $38 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nDean Corso, a New York City rare book dealer, is hired by wealthy collector Boris Balkan. Balkan has acquired a copy of ''The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows'', a book by 17th-century author Aristide Torchia said to be able to summon the [[Devil]]. Torchia is alleged to have written the book in collaboration with the Devil, and only three copies survived when he and his works were burned for heresy. Balkan believes only one of the three is authentic and wants Corso to inspect the other two to determine which one. During his travels, Corso comes into contact with a mysterious woman (\"The Girl\") who appears to be following him.\n\nCorso interviews Liana Telfer, the widow of Andrew Telfer who sold Balkan ''The Nine Gates'' shortly before killing himself. Telfer later seduces Corso, hoping he will sell the book to her. After they have sex, and he refuses to sell, she attacks him, and knocks him unconscious. The next day, Corso goes to a bookseller he had entrusted the book to and finds him hanged in his store like an engraving in ''The Nine Gates''. Corso retrieves the book and travels to [[Toledo, Spain]], to speak to the Ceniza Brothers, book restorers who owned Balkan's copy before the Telfers. The two show him that, of the book's nine engravings, only six are signed \"A.T.\"; the other three are signed \"L.C.F.\" for [[Lucifer]].\n\nCorso travels to [[Sintra]], [[Lisbon Region|Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], and meets with Victor Fargas who owns a copy of ''The Nine Gates''. Corso finds that three different engravings in his copy are signed \"L.C.F.\", and the engravings signed this way have subtle differences from those signed \"A.T.\" Corso relays his findings to Balkan and Balkan orders him to acquire Fargas' copy. The next day the Girl takes Corso to see Fargas, who has been drowned; Corso retrieves Fargas's burnt copy from the fireplace and finds the three \"L.C.F.\" engravings torn out. Corso goes to [[Paris]], [[France]], to investigate the third copy owned by Baroness Kessler. Wary of Corso and knowing he is employed by Balkan, she refuses him. Corso hides Balkan's book in his hotel room and tells Kessler about the \"L.C.F.\" engravings, proposing that each copy has three that together make an authentic set of nine. Intrigued, Kessler allows Corso to look at her copy. Corso is attacked, and the Baroness is strangled to death and her library set on fire. Corso returns to his hotel and discovers Balkan's copy is missing, probably stolen by Liana.\n\nThe Girl and Corso track Liana to a manor where a Satanic [[cult]] are conducting a ritual using Balkan's book. Balkan interrupts the ceremony, takes his copy back, and strangles Liana to death. Corso abandons the Girl, presuming she was working for Balkan, and pursues Balkan but loses him. Corso finds a clue in Kessler's belongings that directs him to a remote castle, where Balkan is preparing to summon the Devil using the nine \"L.C.F.\" engravings. He subdues Corso and forces him to watch as he performs the ritual; it apparently works and grants Balkan power and immunity to harm, and he immolates himself to demonstrate. However, the ritual did not work and Balkan begins to scream in pain. Corso retrieves the engravings and shoots Balkan. Entering Balkan's car, Corso is confronted by the Girl. The two have sex on the ground, the Girl astride Corso and backlit by the castle, now engulfed in flames. Her face appears to change as she grinds on top of Corso.\n\nThe Girl explains Balkan's ritual did not work because one of the engravings was forged. When they stop for gas she leaves, but gives Corso a note sending him to the Ceniza brothers. At their shop, Corso finds they have mysteriously vanished and the shop is being cleaned out. As workmen remove a large bookcase, a dust-covered paper floats down from the top. This is the authentic engraving, which depicts a woman who resembles the Girl [[Whore of Babylon|riding atop a dragon-like beast]] in front of the burning castle. Corso appears returning to the castle with the gates opening up full of bright blinding light, implying the entrance of the Ninth Gate has opened for him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as Dean Corso\n* [[Lena Olin]] as Liana Telfer\n* [[Frank Langella]] as Boris Balkan\n* [[Emmanuelle Seigner]] as The Girl\n* [[James Russo]] as Bernie Ornstein\n* [[Jack Taylor (actor)|Jack Taylor]] as Victor Fargas\n* [[Allen Garfield]] as Witkin\n* [[Barbara Jefford]] as Baroness Frieda Kessler\n* [[Willy Holt]] as Andrew Telfer\n* Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Rodero as Pablo & Pedro Ceniza\n* [[Catherine Benguigui]] as The Concierge\n* Jacques Collard as Gruber\n* [[Jacques Dacqmine]] as Old Man\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Ch\u00e2teau de Ferri\u00e8res (Ferri\u00e8res-en-Brie) - Arri\u00e8re.jpg|thumb|[[Ch\u00e2teau de Ferri\u00e8res]], [[Ferri\u00e8res-en-Brie]], [[Seine-et-Marne]], France]]\n[[Roman Polanski]] read the screenplay by [[Enrique Urbizu]], an adaptation of the Spanish novel ''[[The Club Dumas|El Club Dumas]]'' (''The Club Dumas'', 1993), by [[Arturo P\u00e9rez-Reverte]]. Impressed with the script, Polanski read the novel, liking it because he \"saw so many elements that seemed good for a movie. It was suspenseful, funny, and there were a great number of secondary characters that are tremendously cinematic\".<ref name= \"Hartl, John\">{{cite news | last = Hartl | first = John | title = ''The Ninth Gate'' Marks Return for Polanski | work = [[Seattle Times]] | date = 5 March 2000 }}</ref> P\u00e9rez-Reverte's novel, ''El Club Dumas'' features intertwined plots, so Polanski wrote his own adaptation with his usual partner, John Brownjohn (''[[Tess (1979 film)|Tess]]'', ''[[Pirates (1986 film)|Pirates]]'' and ''[[Bitter Moon]]''). They deleted the novel's literary references and a sub-plot about Dean Corso's investigation of an original manuscript of a chapter of ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'', and concentrated upon Corso's pursuing the authentic copy of ''The Nine Gates''.<ref name= \"Hartl, John\"/>\n\nPolanski approached the subject skeptically, saying, \"I don't believe in the occult.

Depp said, \"It's the director's job to push, to provoke things out of an actor\".<ref name= \"Schaefer, Stephen\"/> Polanski said of Depp, \"He decided to play it rather flat, which wasn't how I envisioned it; and I didn't tell him it wasn't how I saw it\". Visually, in the [[neo-noir]] genre style, rare-book dealer Dean Corso's disheveled grooming derives from [[Philip Marlowe]], [[Raymond Chandler]]'s quintessential literary private investigator.<ref name= \"Howell, Peter\"/>\n\nPolanski cast [[Frank Langella]] as Boris Balkan based upon his performance as Clare Quilty in ''[[Lolita (1997 film)|Lolita]]'' (1997). [[Barbara Jefford]] was a last-minute replacement for the German actress originally cast as the Baroness Frieda Kessler, who fell sick with [[pneumonia]], and after a second actress proved unable to learn the character's dialogue; with only days' notice, Jefford learned her part, spoken with a German accent.<ref name= \"Hartl, John\"/> Depp met his long-time partner [[Vanessa Paradis]] during the shooting.\n\n===Filming===\n''The Ninth Gate'' was filmed in France, Portugal, and Spain in the summer of 1998.
