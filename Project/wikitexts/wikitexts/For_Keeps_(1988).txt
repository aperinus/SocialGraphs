Complications ensue when Darcy becomes [[pregnancy|pregnant]] just before graduation and decides to keep her baby. This movie is noted for being Ringwald's final \"teen\" movie, and is cited as one of her most mature performances, particularly in a scene where Darcy is suffering from [[postpartum depression]] after the birth of her child.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stiernberg |first=Bonnie |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2013/02/the-7-best-molly-ringwald-roles.html |title=The 7 Best Molly Ringwald Roles :: Movies :: Lists :: Paste |publisher=Pastemagazine.com |access-date=2015-01-26}}</ref> The film marks the debut appearance of [[Alex Trebek]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]], Darcy, editor at her high school paper, and her steady boyfriend Stan are in their final year of high school and already have been accepted at good colleges. Before Darcy goes to the [[University of Wisconsin]] to study [[journalism]], she will go on a trip to [[Paris]] with her mother for her graduation present, while Stan will go to [[Caltech]] to study [[architecture]]. With the help of Darcy's best friend Lila, Darcy and Stan spend a weekend together and Darcy becomes pregnant. They announce the pregnancy to their families at Thanksgiving.  Neither Darcy's single-parent mother Donna nor Stan's [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] parents are very supportive. Respectively, they urge the young couple to have an [[abortion]] or give up the baby for [[adoption]]. Darcy plans to have an abortion, but does not go through with it, much to Stan's relief.\n\nAt Christmas, the couple announces their plans to keep the baby, causing a break between them and their parents. They rent a decrepit apartment and marry to the cheers of their friends, despite the fact that without parental consent the marriage is not legal. At the urging of her high school guidance counselor, who explains that other girls will want to emulate her and become adolescent mothers themselves, Darcy drops out of high school but works toward her [[GED]]. Prom is interrupted by Darcy's water breaking.  Although baby Thea (short for Theodosia) is healthy, Darcy suffers from [[post-partum depression]], unable to even hold her daughter, and Stan struggles to pay the bills on a part-time job salary. Only when Darcy hears an intruder (who turns out to be Stan's father) and picks up her baby protectively does she break from her depression.\n\nWithout telling Darcy, Stan sacrifices his Caltech scholarship because there is no married housing at the school for undergraduates. Stan and Darcy\u2019s relationship starts to crumble with fights. Although Stan takes a second dead-end job, the bills pile up, and the couple finally moves in with Donna, which alienates Stan and Darcy, and causes Stan to drink heavily. Local neighborhood girl Michaela informs Darcy of the scholarship deception so she enlists Stan's best friend Chris in a plan to ensure he takes the scholarship and go to college after all. The plan entails throwing Stan out and [[annul]]ling the marriage. Stan has a bad reaction to the news and later in the night goes into a rage outside their house. Stan reconciles with his parents, but is heartbroken over the split with Darcy, who does not change her mind but becomes visibly angry at her mother's cold attitude.\n\nAt Darcy's night school graduation, Stan arrives to inform Darcy that he has applied for scholarships to the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] for them both. Darcy lets slip her role in the Caltech deception with Chris, and Stan chases after her as she drives away. Darcy finally tells Donna that Stan is a good man, that she loves him and Donna can either embrace them as an entire family or watch them live their lives without her. Donna finally lets go of her hurt over the abandonment of Darcy's father and informs Stan about her daughter when he seeks her out. They reconcile at the school, intending to go forward with their plans to attend college in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] in the fall as well as setting a curfew for Thea.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Molly Ringwald]] as Darcy Elliot Bobrucz\n* [[Randall Batinkoff]] as Stan Bobrucz\n* [[Kenneth Mars]] as Mr. Bobrucz\n* [[Miriam Flynn]] as Donna Elliot\n* [[Conchata Ferrell]] as Mrs. Bobrucz\n* [[Sharon Brown (actress)|Sharon Brown]] as Lila\n* John Zarchen as Chris\n* [[Pauly Shore]] as Ryan\n* Michelle Downey as Michaela\n* [[Patricia Barry]] as Adoption Official\n* [[Janet MacLachlan]] as Miss Giles\n* [[Jaclyn Bernstein|Jaclyn-Rose Lester]] as Mary Bobrucz (as Jaclyn Bernstein)\n* Matthew Licht as Leo Bobrucz\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Estevez]] as Marnie\n* [[Darcy DeMoss]] as Elaine\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\nThe film is set in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] and was partially filmed there. Primary location work took place in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], [[Canada]].\n\nThe film had a number of titles while in production, possibilities including \"Maybe, Baby\" (by which it is known in some overseas territories) and \"For Keeps?\", before settling on the final question mark-less version.\n\nJohn Zarchen suffered a life-threatening head injury while driving in Hollywood. He survived  a brief period of being comatose, and actually returned to the film, although director John Avildsen, due to his medical absence and disgusted with the actor's disregard for the opportunity and the production, greatly cut down his role. This movie also marks the film debut of [[Pauly Shore]], who appears in a small role as another friend of Stan.\n\nThe musical score features a lullaby-like version of the song \"[[Be My Baby]]\", sung by composer [[Ellie Greenwich]].\n\n===Casting===\nActor [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0797830/ Adam Silbar] was originally cast in the lead role of Stan but, for unknown reasons, the role was later re-cast with Randall Batinkoff just weeks before the first day of production. Author and casting director [[Paul G. Bens, Jr.]], then an actor, was one of the two finalists to replace Silbar.  The role ultimately went to Batinkoff.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Critical reception===\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] aggregate score gave the film a 17% rotten rating based on 12 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|title=''For Keeps'' (1988)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/for_keeps/|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|access-date=16 March 2021}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a positive review saying, \"The movies of Molly Ringwald have been responsible for a revolution in the way Hollywood regards teenagers. Before Ringwald (and her mentor, [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]) there were only horny teenagers, dead teenagers, teenage vampires and psychotic crackups. Now teenage movies are working their way through some of the aspects of the normal life of American teenagers, and in 'For Keeps,' Ringwald plays a popular high school senior who gets pregnant and gets married.\"\n\n[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, \"Most of ''For Keeps'' is entirely predictable, but that should do little to diminish its interest for audiences of high-school age. Here again, Miss Ringwald is the very model of teen-age verisimilitude, and she's most impressive in making even the most hackneyed situations seem real. In fact, she's so good she's almost a problem. Mr. Batinkoff, while pleasant, is no real match for her, and the glowering parents who make their kids' lives miserable for a time are no real threat. There is the feeling that Miss Ringwald's Darcy can triumph over anything. But perhaps that's just what Mr. Avildsen had in mind.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Maslin |first=Janet |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DE2DC173FF936A25752C0A96E948260 |title=Movie Review - For Keeps - Film: 'For Keeps,' on Teen-Age Pregnancy |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1988-01-15 |access-date=2015-01-26}}</ref>\n\nJudge Brian Pope gave a positive review saying, \"Pretty but approachable, smart but funny, cool but sweet, Ringwald represented everything most high-school girls wanted to be: the girl next door who always got the guy without compromising her values. Small wonder she is still regarded as an icon of 1980s teen cinema. It wasn't until Ringwald began dipping her toes into slightly more adult roles that she lost her footing. Take 'For Keeps', for instance. This movie dared to suggest that even a popular honors student is capable of making wrong decisions that result in life-changing consequences. More crucially, Ringwald suggested to her fans that the qualities they found so endearing in her aren't always adequate substitutes for natural maturity. Perhaps that was a bitter pill for her fans to swallow, but it's not such a bad message, and, more than 15 years after its release, 'For Keeps' isn't such a bad movie.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/forkeeps.php |title=DVD Verdict Review - For Keeps |publisher=Dvdverdict.com |date=2004-05-11 |access-date=2015-01-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831195031/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/forkeeps.php |archive-date=2014-08-31 }}</ref>\n\nDavid Nusair gave a more negative review saying, \"For Keeps takes a potentially intriguing subject (two teenagers attempting to start their lives together) and piles on cliche after cliche, until it's about as compelling as an afterschool special.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reelfilm.com/mini9.htm#forkeeps |title=Mini Reviews (August 2001) - Reviews by David Nusair |publisher=Reelfilm.com |access-date=2015-01-26}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nIn January 1988, the film debuted at #4 at the box office (behind ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]'', ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]'', and ''[[Moonstruck]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&yr=1988&wknd=05&p=.htm |title=Weekend Box Office Results for January 29-31, 1988 |publisher=Box Office Mojo |access-date=2015-01-26}}</ref> Grossing $17,514,553 domestically,<ref name=\"boxofficemojo1\"/> the film is a box office success given its estimated budget of $10 million.\n\n===Home media===\nOn March 23, 2004 the film was released on [[DVD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdsreleasedates.com/movies/888/For-Keeps?-(1988).html |title=For Keeps?
