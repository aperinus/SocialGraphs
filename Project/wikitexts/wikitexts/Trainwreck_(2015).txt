The film stars Schumer and [[Bill Hader]] along with an ensemble cast that includes [[Brie Larson]], [[Colin Quinn]], [[John Cena]], [[Vanessa Bayer]], [[Tilda Swinton]], [[Ezra Miller]], [[LeBron James]], [[Mike Birbiglia]], and [[Norman Lloyd]]. The film is about a hard-drinking, promiscuous, free-spirited young magazine writer named Amy Townsend (Schumer) who has her first serious relationship with a prominent orthopedic surgeon named Aaron Conners (Hader). The film received positive reviews from critics, praising the performances of Schumer, Hader and Cena and the screenplay.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on May 19, 2014, in New York City. The film premiered at [[South by Southwest]] on March 15, 2015, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 17, 2015, by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film won several awards and was nominated for numerous others, including two [[73rd Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Awards]] ([[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]]) and the [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- See WP:FILMPLOT for more information. The plot summary is recommended to be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn 1992, Gordon Townsend tells his young daughters Amy and Kim that the impending divorce with their mom was inevitable as [[monogamy]] is not realistic, repeating it like a mantra. Twenty-three years later in 2015, Amy is a heavy-drinking, over-sexed, party girl, writes for a men's magazine, and is seeing gym-addict Steven. Her cold British boss, Dianna, assigns her to write an article about sports doctor Aaron Conners.\n\nWhile interviewing Aaron, a text from Kim insisting they move Gordon to a cheaper assisted-living facility causes Amy to hyperventilate. He calms her down, suggesting dinner. There, he praises her writing and talks about his family. After drinks, she suggests going to his place and having sex. Although it's against her rule of never sleeping over after sex, she stays the night when asked.\n\nThe next day, Aaron calls to ask if they can see each other again. Panicking, she tells him they will talk about it at the interview, then she and her friend Nikki decide it has to end. Meanwhile, Aaron's friend, [[LeBron James]], is excited for him as Aaron has not dated for six years. Amy watches Aaron's surgery to [[Billy Joel]]'s \"[[Uptown Girl]]\", his favorite song. Afterwards, she tries to break it off, but he insists they like each other and should date. Amy then gets a call that her father has fallen, so Aaron drives and tends to her father.\n\nAaron and Amy begin dating and fall for each other. She is worried she is going to mess up, but Kim tells her she is just doing what's normal. Gordon overdoses and dies from a stockpile of his medication. At his funeral, Amy and Kim have a falling out: Amy accuses Kim of not caring about Gordon as she has always been more sympathetic towards him and has developed a similar outlook on relationships and life in general over the years. Shortly after, Aaron tells Amy for the first time that he loves her, who berates him for choosing that particular day to start saying it.\n\nAaron receives a prestigious award at a luncheon and brings Amy. While he is making his speech, Amy gets a call from her boss Dianna, who threatens to fire her if she does not answer. So, she takes the call, leaving during his speech. Afterwards, Aaron is upset that she missed it, so they start arguing. Returning home, Aaron thinks they should not go to bed angry, so Amy rants all night. Too tired to operate on [[Amar'e Stoudemire]] that morning, he tells Amy they need to take a break. Hurt, Amy tells him they should just break up as his article got canceled. Saying \"You win,\" he leaves.\n\nOut drinking with her co-workers, the intern takes Amy home; their bizarre sexual encounter is interrupted by his mom, revealing he is only 16. The next day, Dianna fires Amy for the incident. Aaron is moping in his apartment when LeBron calls, claiming he has been injured. He rushes over to find an intervention, including LeBron, [[Matthew Broderick]], [[Chris Evert]], and [[Marv Albert]]. They tell him he has always been afraid of opening up and needs to fix things with Amy, but Aaron insists it is over.\n\nMaking amends with Kim, Amy catches up; and they, Kim and her family, comfort her with a group hug. Amy decides it is time to change, clearing out all the alcohol from her apartment. She takes her Aaron story to ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', where it gets published, sending Aaron the magazine with the story. After attending a game at [[Madison Square Garden]], Aaron is called back to the court, where the Knicks City Dancers perform with Amy front and center, to Aaron's favorite songs, including \"Uptown Girl\". She tells him she wants to make their relationship work. They profess their love and kiss, to applause.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Amy Schumer]]<ref name=\"slashfilm1\">{{cite web
