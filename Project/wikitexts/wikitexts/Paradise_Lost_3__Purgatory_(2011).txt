The three films are about [[West Memphis Three]], three teenage boys accused of the May 1993 murders and sexual mutilation of three prepubescent boys as a part of an alleged [[satanic ritual abuse|satanic ritual]] in [[West Memphis, Arkansas]].<ref name=Ebert>{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Paradise Lost 2: Revelations|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000313/REVIEWS/3130301|publisher=Chicago Sun Times|access-date=22 September 2011}}</ref> ''Purgatory'' offers an update on the case of the West Memphis Three, who were all recognized guilty of the murders in 1994 but kept on claiming their innocence since then, before culminating with the trio's attempt at an [[Alford plea]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2011 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 11, 2011, before airing on [[HBO]] on January 12, 2012. It received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]], as well as [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Exceptional Merit in Documentary Filmmaking|Exceptional Merit in Documentary Filmmaking]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for Nonfiction Programming|Outstanding Directing for Nonfiction Programming]].\n\n==Description==\n[[Joe Berlinger]] and [[Bruce Sinofsky]] update the case of the [[West Memphis Three]] since the release of ''Paradise Lost 2: Revelations'' in 2000. [[Damien Echols]]'s defense team has hired some of the most renowned forensic scientists to collect DNA and other evidence that had never been tested during the 1994 trials in hopes of getting a new trial. The defense teams and supporters of Echols, [[Jason Baldwin]], and [[Jessie Misskelley]] have uncovered new details that occurred during the trial that led to guilty verdicts against them.\n\nCentral are the allegations of jury misconduct with the jury foreman discussing the case with an attorney during the Echols-Baldwin trial and bringing Misskelley's confession into deliberations even though it was not let into evidence. The forensic experts have uncovered DNA and new witnesses that focus suspicion toward Terry Hobbs, the stepfather of one of the murder victims.\n\nA hair found in the ligature that bound one of the victims is a match to him, he has told several conflicting stories concerning his whereabouts during the time of the murders, and he has a history of violence against his wife and possibly his stepson. While many are convinced he should be considered a suspect, the [[West Memphis, Arkansas]] Police Department have only questioned him and do not consider him a suspect.\n\nAppeals for a new trial based on the new evidence have been denied by the original trial judge. But in November 2010, the [[Arkansas Supreme Court]] threw out that ruling and granted an evidentiary hearing scheduled for December 2011, to decide if the evidence is enough for a new trial. This brings new hope to the defendants and their supporters that they will finally get the fair trial they never got.\n\nIn August 2011, four months before the hearing is to take place, the prosecutors and defense lawyers talked over a plea deal that would allow the three men to walk out of prison, on the condition that they [[Alford plea|plead guilty but can maintain their innocence]]. They reluctantly accept the deal, after 18 years and 78 days, they walk free from prison.\n\n==Release==\nOriginally intended to be another installment in which the three men remained in prison, the film was to premiere on the [[HBO]] network in November 2011.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://realscreen.com/2011/07/29/hbo-to-air-paradise-lost-3/ | title=HBO to air \"Paradise Lost 3\"}}</ref> The world premiere of the film was announced to occur at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in September 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tiff.net/press/pressreleases/2011/festival-unveils-highly-anticipated-world-premieres-of-documentaries-from-werner-herzog-morgan-spurlock-jessica-yu-nick-broomfield-and-more |title=Tiff.net - 2011 Press Releases - Festival Unveils Highly Anticipated World Premieres of Documentaries from Werner Herzog, Morgan Spurlock, Jessica Yu, Nick Broomfield and More |access-date=2012-03-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111181226/http://tiff.net/press/pressreleases/2011/festival-unveils-highly-anticipated-world-premieres-of-documentaries-from-werner-herzog-morgan-spurlock-jessica-yu-nick-broomfield-and-more |archive-date=2012-11-11 }}</ref>\n\nDue to the sudden August 19 release of the West Memphis Three,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wm3org.typepad.com/blog/2011/08/the-west-memphis-three-are-free.html |title=THE WEST MEMPHIS THREE ARE FREE!
