The film is based on the 2006 [[Platinum Studios]] graphic novel [[Cowboys & Aliens (comics)|of the same name]] created by [[Scott Mitchell Rosenberg]]. The plot revolves around an [[amnesia]]c outlaw (Craig), a wealthy cattleman (Ford), and a mysterious traveler (Wilde) who must ally to save a group of townspeople [[Alien abduction|abducted]] by [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]]. The screenplay was written by [[Roberto Orci]], [[Alex Kurtzman]], [[Damon Lindelof]], [[Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby|Mark Fergus, and Hawk Ostby]], based on a screen story by the latter two along with [[Steve Oedekerk]]. The film was produced by [[Brian Grazer]], [[Ron Howard]], Kurtzman, Orci, and Rosenberg, with [[Steven Spielberg]] and Favreau serving as [[executive producers]].\n\nThe project began development in April 1997, when [[Universal Pictures]] and [[DreamWorks Pictures]] bought film rights to a concept [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] by Rosenberg, former president at [[Malibu Comics]], which he described as a graphic novel in development. After the graphic novel was published in 2006, development on the film was begun again, and Favreau signed on as director in September 2009. On a budget of $163 million, filming for ''Cowboys & Aliens'' began in June 2010, in [[New Mexico]] and [[California]]. Despite studio pressure to release the film in [[3D film|3-D]], Favreau chose to film traditionally and in [[anamorphic format]] ([[widescreen]] picture on standard [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]]) to further a \"classic movie feel\".<ref name=fxguide /> Measures were taken to maintain a serious Western element despite the film's \"inherently comic\" title and premise.<ref name=\"question\" /> The film's aliens were designed to be \"cool and captivating\",<ref name=\"Desowitz\" /> with some details, such as a fungus that grows on their wounds, created to depict the creatures as frontiersmen facing adversity in an unfamiliar place.\n\n''Cowboys & Aliens'' premiered at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|2011 San Diego Comic-Con]] and was released theatrically in the United States by [[Universal Pictures]] on July 29, 2011, with [[Paramount Pictures]] helping with international releases. The film was considered to be a financial disappointment, taking $174.8 million in box office receipts on a $163 million budget. ''Cowboys & Aliens'' received mixed reviews, with critics generally praising its acting and special effects, but criticizing the screenplay and tone.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1873 [[New Mexico Territory]], a man awakens injured in the desert with a strange metal bracelet attached to his left wrist and no memory. He wanders into the town of Absolution, where [[preacher]] Meacham treats his wound. [[Sheriff]] John Taggart recognizes the stranger as wanted outlaw Jake Lonergan and attempts to arrest him. Jake nearly escapes, but a woman named Ella Swenson interferes. Taggart and his men prepare to transport both Jake and petulant young drunkard Percy Dolarhyde to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] for trial.\n\nPercy's father, Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde, a ruthless [[Cowman (profession)|cattle baron]], arrives with armed men and demands Percy be released. He also wants Jake, who has stolen gold from him. During the standoff, alien ships begin attacking the town. Percy, Taggart, and other townsfolk are abducted by grappling cables fired from the bottom of the ships. Jake's bracelet inexplicably activates and transforms, becoming a [[directed energy weapon|weapon]]; he shoots down a ship, ending the attack.\n\nDolarhyde, Ella, and other townsfolk form a [[Posse comitatus|posse]] to track an injured alien that escaped from the downed ship. Meanwhile, Jake travels to an abandoned cabin and, in a flashback, recalls returning to it with stolen gold and then being abducted, along with a woman named Alice, by the aliens. His memories returning, Jake joins the posse. During the evening, they come upon a capsized [[Paddle wheel ship|paddle wheel]] [[steamboat]] that the aliens apparently dumped far from any large river. They camp inside it; during the night, the alien kills Meacham, who sacrifices himself to save Emmett, Taggart's grandson.\n\nBy morning, most of the posse has deserted, and Jake's former gang attacks the rest. Jake, who stole the gang's loot after their last heist, attempts to retake control but is foiled. The aliens attack again and abduct Ella. Jake jumps aboard the ship and attacks the alien pilot, causing the ship to crash in a river. The pilot survives the crash and attacks Ella, fatally wounding her, before Jake kills it with his wrist-blaster.\n\nThe remaining posse is captured by [[Chiricahua people|Chiricahua Apache]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], who blame them for the alien attacks. After Ella's corpse is dumped on a fire by a Chiricahua warrior, she is resurrected and emerges from the fire. Ella reveals herself to be from another alien race, who had traveled to Earth to help resist the invaders after they destroyed her home world. The aliens \u2013 who are mining gold and abducting people to conduct experiments on them \u2013 have superior weaponry and are far stronger and more durable than humans; only Jake's wrist weapon or a well-aimed round from a rifle can kill them with a single shot. Ella tells them that the previous attackers were just scouts.\n\nShe also claims Jake holds the secret to the aliens' whereabouts and argues that they must defeat the aliens before the invaders exterminate all life on Earth. After taking medicine offered by the Apaches' [[medicine man]], Jake's memory returns. He recalls watching Alice get [[vivisection|vivisected]] and [[Euthanasia|euthanized]]; he escaped by stealing the bracelet encasing his wrist. He also remembers the location of the aliens' base of operations: their landed [[Mother ship#In popular culture|mother ship]].\n\nWith this knowledge, they plan to attack the alien base. Jake leaves to persuade his old gang to join the fight while Dolarhyde takes command of the original group and the Apaches. After the combined groups maneuver the aliens into a ground battle, Jake and Ella board the ship and free the captives, but Jake is captured. Dolarhyde rescues him, and both men escape from the ship after killing the alien responsible for Alice's death (identified as Jake left a distinctive scar on its eye in his original escape). The ship takes off as the remaining aliens flee Earth, but Ella stays on board to end the threat: she sacrifices herself by entering the ship's core and turning Jake's wrist weapon into a bomb; it detonates, obliterating the ship.\n\nWith the aliens gone, the rescued townsfolk begin remembering their pasts. Still a wanted man, Jake chooses to leave; the sheriff and Dolarhyde decide to claim he was killed in the invasion. The citizens intend to rebuild their town with the gold taken from the aliens.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as Jake Lonergan, an [[amnesia]]c [[Outlaw (stock character)|outlaw]].\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde, a powerful [[Cowman (profession)|cattleman]]\n* [[Olivia Wilde]] as Ella Swenson, a mysterious traveler who aids Lonergan.\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Doc, the town's doctor and owner of Absolution's local saloon\n* [[Noah Ringer]] as Emmett Taggart, John Taggart's grandson.\n* [[Paul Dano]] as Percy Dolarhyde, Woodrow's trouble-making son.\n* [[Clancy Brown]] as Meacham, Absolution's [[preacher]]\n* [[Keith Carradine]] as Sheriff John Taggart, Absolution's sheriff.\n* [[Adam Beach]] as Nat Colorado, Dolarhyde's Native American right-hand man.\n* [[Abigail Spencer]] as Alice, Jake's lost love.\n* [[Ana de la Reguera]] as Mar\u00eda, Absolution's saloon maid and Doc's wife.\n* [[Buck Taylor]] as Wes Clairbourne, a bandit who threatens Jake.\n* [[Walton Goggins]] as Hunt, a bandit and friend of Lonergan.\n* [[Julio Cedillo]] as Bronc, a Mexican bandit.\n* [[David O'Hara]] as Pat Dolan, Lonergan's former gang-member.\n* [[Toby Huss]] as Roy Murphy\n* [[Raoul Trujillo]] as [[Baishan (Apache)|Black Knife]], the Chiricahua Apache chief.\n* Paul Ortega as Apache [[Medicine man|Medicine Man]]\n* [[Wyatt Russell]] as Little Mickey\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and casting===\n{{multiple image|total_width=270|image1=Daniel Craig - Film Premiere \"Spectre\" 007 - on the Red Carpet in Berlin (22387409720) (cropped).jpg|image2=Harrison Ford by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|alt1=A head shot of a light-haired man in a suit|alt2=A head shot of an older man with gray hair, wearing dark sunglasses|footer=[[Daniel Craig]] and [[Harrison Ford]] portray two of the film's protagonists.

And it was a real unveiling of the creature, little by little, and using lighting and camera work and music to make it a very subjective experience. And so we tried to preserve that here.\"<ref name=\"moviefone\" /> In designing the film's aliens, ILM was careful to make the creatures \"cool and captivating\".<ref name=\"Desowitz\"/> Guyett stated that they adopted a similar approach to that of ''[[District 9]]'':\n\n[[File:Yellow fungus in Cowboys & Aliens.png|thumb|alt=A reptilian creature in a desert landscape, impaled by multiple arrows, having wounds secreting a dark-colored blood and growing a yellow fungus|An alien with wounds covered in a yellow fungus. Details such as this were created to depict the creatures as frontiersmen facing adversity in an unfamiliar place.<ref name=fxguide />]]\n\n{{blockquote|The trick was to make [the aliens] interesting through their behavior and what happens to them, and that was something that ''District 9'' did very well. You were drawn into their world a bit and their idiosyncrasies had an immediate impact: they ate cat food. But those details overwhelm certain design aspects, so I was striving to find some behavior that fit in well with the Western genre, where you have people in very arduous conditions fighting the elements. And I thought that the irony of all this was that the aliens turn up and it could be more exaggerated for them. They're frontiersmen in a way: traveling to another place and having to deal with all the adversities of the climate. And in our case, we played up the fact that they weren't comfortable in our world. There are flies all around them; they don't like the light; and when they were wounded and exposed, a strange fungus grows around them.<ref name=\"Desowitz\">{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/2011/08/03/ilm_talks_cowboys_aliens_visual_effects/ |title=ILM Talks Cowboys & Aliens Visual Effects |last=Desowitz |first=Bill |publisher=[[indieWire]] |date=2011-08-03 |access-date=2011-09-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812130129/http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/2011/08/03/ilm_talks_cowboys_aliens_visual_effects/ |archive-date=2011-08-12 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe use of anamorphic widescreen (rather than shooting full-frame \"flat\" and cropping later) gave ILM no extra room to re-frame shots; it was a challenge to show both nine-foot-tall aliens and smaller humans in the same space. Instead, Guyett said, they shot more areas in case portions of the shots were lost. In filming the gun battle between the cowboys and aliens, in which the aliens move at twice the speed of the humans, actors were required to ride through the scene on horseback and shoot at men in gray suits and three-foot-tall hats; they aimed at faces drawn by Jon Favreau on the top of the hats. A big challenge for ILM's [[texture artist]]s was to show the aliens in both a dark cave environment and harsh sunlight. The creatures were rendered in high resolution for close-ups; dirt and wounds were added to the aliens to emphasize the injuries they sustained in battle. After Favreau requested that the aliens experience a very unpleasant biological reaction to being wounded on Earth, the texture team created a yellow fungus-like look on the scars of the aliens. To design the fungus, texture supervisor Martin Murphy searched the Internet for real pictures of mold and growth on trees and eventually designed a \"fried egg pattern\".<ref name=fxguide /> The heads of the aliens were based on those of [[sea turtle]]s, after Favreau encountered sea turtles during a trip to [[Hawaii]].<ref name=OuterSpaceIcon />\n\nAt the suggestion of Steven Spielberg,<ref name=commentary /> an \"[[\u00fcber]]-alien\" was also designed.<ref name=\"Desowitz\" /> It was unclear if the red scar Jake gives the \u00fcber-alien after escaping [[vivisection]] would be enough of an identifier to distinguish it from other aliens, so the creature was redesigned<ref name=commentary /> with translucent, pale skin due to the lack of time spent outside.<ref name=OuterSpaceIcon /> Favreau described the \u00fcber-alien as more fleshy and [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] than the other aliens<ref name=commentary6>Favreau, 1:44:45-1:45:27</ref> and Murphy commented, \"There are some parts of him like his arm that you can see into. It's almost like glass or ice or gelatiny surface that blends into a dryer area. The {{sic}} there's pieces of him that are more like a soft-shell crab or shiny and wet.\"<ref name=fxguide />\n\nIn addition to the aliens, other visual effects were required for the speeders, the alien spaceship, its interior, environment re-creations, and the [[head-up display]] for Jake's arm gauntlet. For the invasion of the town of Absolution, both practical laser lighting and fire effects were utilized, along with practical ships and effects enhancements. ILM artists had to enhance the initial look of the alien \"bolos\", the cables used to abduct people, with renderings such as extra lights, after viewers thought the studio had failed to \"paint out\" the cables in the film\u2019s first trailer. For a scene in which Jake and Ella ride on a speeder, the actors were filming on a practical mock-up against bluescreen; they were digitally replaced in wider shots.<ref name=fxguide/>\n\n==Themes==\nIn ''Cowboys & Aliens'', Director Jon Favreau sought a plausible approach to how humans from the late 19th century could confront extraterrestrial beings armed with advanced weaponry. He said, \"It was very well laid out, well planned, and there were a lot of discussions with a lot of actors who called me to task on things that seemed too convenient, so we made sure we earned each step.\"<ref name=\"west\" /> The director also sought to maintain a Western tone as aliens appeared in the film, saying, \"It's very easy to just cut the string and then all of a sudden the action starts and you're in ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]''.\"<ref name=\"west\">{{cite news | last=Kaye | first=Don | url=http://movies.msn.com/paralleluniverse/cowboys-and-aliens-editing/story/across-the-universe/?icid=MOVIES2&GT1=MOVIES2 | title=Go West | publisher=[[MSNBC]] | date=December 13, 2010 | access-date=April 27, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325224356/http://movies.msn.com/paralleluniverse/cowboys-and-aliens-editing/story/across-the-universe/?icid=MOVIES2&GT1=MOVIES2 | archive-date=March 25, 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Favreau cited the works of [[John Ford]] and [[Sergio Leone]] as sources of inspiration as well as ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]''.<ref name=\"know\" /> Favreau also wanted the science-fiction element to stand on its own,<ref name=\"west\" /> referencing ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'', ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator]]'', and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''.<ref name=\"know\" /> He said of both genres, \"It's about finding the intersection of those two genres . . . If you do it right, it honors both, and it becomes interesting and clever and a reinvention of two things that people understand the conventions of, instead of just a retread or remake or sequel or reboot of a film you've seen before.\"<ref name=\"west\" />\n\nIn the Americas, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] nations were severely damaged by European settlers, specifically because of the Europeans' advanced military technology. Favreau compared the film to the historical confrontation \"in the frustration of not having the technology to allow you to prevail. It's always the low-tech culture that feels powerless when faced with an enemy that has technology on their side.\"<ref name=\"sneak\" /> In the film, the cowboys are the low-tech culture, and the aliens with advanced technology possess the belief of [[Manifest Destiny]]. Favreau also said of the premise, \"It allows the cowboys and Native Americans to come together, which would be impossible had there not been a greater common enemy. It sets the Western up in a very classic way and then turns it on its ear.\"<ref name=\"sneak\" /> When the aliens appear, the film becomes a [[road movie]] in which the main characters try to track the aliens, team up with different groups, and ultimately confront the aliens. Favreau compared the gathering to ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' in facing seemingly insurmountable odds in their confrontation.<ref>{{cite web | last=Vejvoda | first=Jim | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/115/1158107p1.html | title=We've Seen Some Cowboys & Aliens | website=[[IGN]] | date=March 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe character of Meacham also presents an unconventional take on [[Christianity|Christian]] principles to support the film's main theme of redemption.

Debruge appreciated the attention paid to the roots of the two genres, saying \"beneath all the state-of-the-art special effects beats an old-fashioned heart, one that prizes both of the genres in play\" and concluded that \"a canny blend of CG and practical effects serve the sci-fi elements well, while location shooting and Mary Zophres' form-fitting period duds make the West look its best.\"<ref name=\"ReviewVariety\"/> Nick Pinkerton of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' said the Western elements of the film were \"lovingly\" handled but felt the science aspects were a \"gimmick\" and \"much more standard fare\" in comparison. He added that \"Ford, enlivened by dude garb, seems to enjoy himself in front of a camera for the first time in decades\".<ref name=\"ReviewVillageVoice\"/>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars out of four, writing that \"as preposterous moneymakers go, it's ambitious and well-made. The acting from the large cast is of a high standard, Craig and Ford were more or less born into their roles, and director Jon Favreau actually develops his characters and gives them things to do, instead of posing them in front of special effects.\" He lamented that the film was not a pure Western, saying of the aliens, \"[T]here is more genuine suspense when [Percy Dolarhyde] starts shooting up the town than when countless aliens appear\".<ref name=\"ReviewEbert\"/> ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]''{{'}}s Andrew O'Hehir offered a mixed response, claiming the film to be well made and clever, and singling out Craig and Ford for their performances. O'Hehir was critical of the combination of western and science-fiction elements, calling it \"a mediocre western clumsily welded to a mediocre alien shoot-'em-up\".<ref name=\"ReviewSalon\"/>\n\n''[[Slant Magazine|Slant]]''{{'}}s Nick Schager reacted negatively, stating \"''Cowboys & Aliens'' [[Mashup (book)|mashes up]] genres with a staunch dedication to getting everything wrong, making sure that each scene is more inane than the one that preceded it\"; giving the film one star out of four. Schager continued, \"''Cowboys & Aliens''{{'}}s western accoutrements are [...] so false as to be stunning, with every steely-eyed glare from Craig's Man With No Memory, every confrontation between his Jake and Ford's grizzled Dolarhyde, and every silhouetted horseback ride across a sunset range seeming like a wan approximation of a familiar genre staple. [...] Favreau's visuals have an inauthentic and bland blockbuster sheen, and his actors are similarly afflicted with a case of [[poseur]]-itis (Craig's affected silent-type glowering, Ford's gruff racism, or Wilde's blank, wide-eyed stares), failing to deliver a single believable line-reading or gesture.\"<ref name=\"slant\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n''Cowboys & Aliens'' received five nominations.
