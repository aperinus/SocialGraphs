It is a remake of the 1973 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[television film|made-for-television]] [[Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (1973 film)|film of the same name]].<ref name=\"V1\">{{cite news |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118003272.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title='Dark' days for Katie Holmes|last=Fleming|first=Michael|date=May 6, 2009|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=2009-08-18}}</ref> The film stars [[Katie Holmes]], [[Guy Pearce]], and [[Bailee Madison]], as a family moving into a 19th-century Rhode Island mansion, where the withdrawn daughter (Sally) begins to witness malevolent creatures that emerge from a sealed ash pit in the basement of the house. [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]], [[Alan Dale]], [[Garry McDonald]], and [[Julia Blake]] star in supporting roles.\n\nAn international co-production between the United States, Australia, and Mexico, it was filmed at the Drusilla Mansion in [[Mount Macedon, Victoria|Mount Macedon]] and [[Melbourne]] (both in [[Victoria, Australia]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/movies/dont-be-afraid-of-the-dark-20111103-1mw6a.html|location=Melbourne|work=The Age|title=Don't Be Afraid of the Dark|date=November 4, 2011}}</ref>\n\n''Don't Be Afraid of the Dark'' was released theatrically in the United States on August 26, 2011, by [[FilmDistrict]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Holmes, Pearce and Madison's performances, direction, atmosphere and musical score, but criticized the lack of originality and [[jump scare]]s. The film grossed $38.3 million against a $25 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nAt Blackwood Manor in [[Providence County, Rhode Island]] in the 19th century, renowned wildlife painter Lord Blackwood summons his housekeeper to the basement where he reluctantly bludgeons her to death. He removes her teeth, as well as his own, and offers them to mysterious creatures inside an ash pit within an old fireplace; the creatures reject his offer and demand only the teeth of children. Blackwood begs for them to give back his kidnapped son, only to be dragged in by the creatures.\n\nIn present day, 8-year-old Sally Hurst arrives in Rhode Island to live with her father Alex and his girlfriend Kim, both restoring Blackwood Manor to put it on the market for their client. Sally is depressed due to her mother forcefully putting her in Alex's care and giving her copious amounts of [[Adderall]]. The creatures are awakened by a tune from the nightlight. The next day, Sally hears the creatures calling her name and follows the voices to a sealed fireplace. \"BE AFRAID\" is written in [[runes]] above it.\n\nShe opens the fireplace and finds one of the old housekeeper's teeth. The creatures prove to be hostile, stealing Alex's razor and shredding Kim's clothes. Alex blames Sally and finds a 19th-century silver coin in her possession, which she found under her pillow after the tooth disappeared. Sally sneaks to the basement to talk with the creatures, but Mr. Harris, one of the workers, sends her away and tries to seal the fireplace. The creatures brutally attack him and he is hospitalized.\n\nKim visits Harris in the hospital, who tells her to find the unpublished artwork of Lord Blackwood in the local library. The artwork is of a creature the librarian describes as being like [[tooth fairy|tooth fairies]], which sometimes turn a human into one of their own. Sally is attacked again by the creatures, the leader being a transformed Lord Blackwood. Kim finds an undiscovered mural painted by Blackwood, depicting his son being taken by the creatures. Sally is trapped in the library by the creatures, but fends them off using her camera flash since they are afraid of the light. She also manages to kill one of them.\n\nAlex and Kim try to flee the house with Sally but they are all ambushed by the creatures and knocked out. When Sally wakes up, her feet have been tied, and the creatures are starting to drag her to the basement for her transformation. Kim awakens and frees Sally, only to get caught herself in the ropes and break both her legs in a gruesome manner. The creatures drag Kim into the fireplace, as a distraught Sally crushes the creature who used to be Lord Blackwood to death. Alex and Sally mourn Kim's loss.\n\nSome time later, both return to the abandoned mansion to leave a drawing of Kim there. After they leave, a draft pulls the drawing into the creatures' lair; the entrance is now bolted with metal. Kim has now been transformed. As the creatures plan to come out, Kim convinces them to stay in hiding because they \"have all the time in the world\" and others will come to the manor.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bailee Madison]] as Sally Hurst\n* [[Katie Holmes]] as Kim Raphael\n* [[Guy Pearce]] as Alex Hurst\n* [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] as William Harris\n* [[Alan Dale]] as Charles Jacoby\n* [[Trudy Hellier]] as Evelyn Jacoby\n* [[Julia Blake]] as Mrs. Underhill\n* [[Garry McDonald (actor)|Garry McDonald]] as Emerson Blackwood\n* [[Nicholas Bell]] as Psychiatrist\n* [[James Mackay (actor)|James Mackay]] as Librarian\n* [[Emelia Burns]] as Caterer\n* [[Grant Piro]], [[Dylan Young]], [[Guillermo del Toro]], Todd Macdonald, and Angus Smallwood (creature voices)\n\n==Production==\nDel Toro chose Troy Nixey to direct the film after seeing Nixey's short film ''Latchkey's Lament''. For the design of the creatures in the film, Nixey drew inspiration from pictures of [[mole rats]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetsmag.com/blog?id=210|title=Movie Pick: 'Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark'|work=planetsmag.com|access-date=April 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Influences===\nDel Toro has attributed the idea of giving the creatures in the film a fairy origin to the work of the writer [[Arthur Machen]], saying in an interview: \"I love the Welsh author Arthur Machen and his idea that fairy lore comes from a dark place, that it\u2019s derived from little, pre-human creatures who are really, really nasty vermin but are magical in a way, living as they do for hundreds of years. His books are what compelled me to do this.\" Machen's stories are specifically mentioned in the film by the librarian character.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nDel Toro is a long-standing admirer of Machen and said his work was also an influence on ''[[Pan's Labyrinth|El Laberinto Del Fauno]]'' (''Pan's Labyrinth'') and ''[[Hellboy II: The Golden Army]]'' both of which also feature fairy creatures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cineaste.com/articles/emdarkem-deeds-an-interview-with-guillermo-del-toro-and-guy-pearce|title=Dark Deeds: An Interview with Guillermo del Toro and Guy Pearce by Robert Cashill|work=cineaste.com|access-date=October 9, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007004649/http://www.cineaste.com/articles/emdarkem-deeds-an-interview-with-guillermo-del-toro-and-guy-pearce|archive-date=October 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe name of \"Emerson Blackwood\", the character who built the mansion in the film, is a tribute to [[Algernon Blackwood]], another writer of supernatural horror stories.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Release==\nThis picture, which was developed with [[Miramax]] in the wake of the division's closure and sale, was released by [[FilmDistrict]], and was rated R despite filmmaker ambitions to the contrary.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2010/07/guillermo-del-toro-dont-be-afriad-of-the-dark.html Guillermo del Toro isn't afraid of...
