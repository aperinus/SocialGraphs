The screenplay by [[Gustin Nash]] focuses on a teenager who begins to dispense [[Therapy|therapeutic advice]] and prescription drugs to the student body at his new [[high school]] in order to become popular.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] on May 1, 2007, and was shown at the [[March\u00e9 du Film|Cannes Film Market]], the [[Hawaii International Film Festival|Maui Film Festival]], and the [[Cambridge Film Festival]] before going into theatrical release in the United States and Canada on August 3, 2007. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed just $5 million against its $12 million budget.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2008/02/19/robert-downey-jr-and-charlie-bartlett/|title=Robert Downey Jr. and Charlie Bartlett|website=www.villagevoice.com|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Charlie Bartlett Movie: Showtimes, Review, Trailer, Posters, News & Videos {{!}} eTimes|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/english/movie-details/charlie-bartlett/movieshow/61326281.cms|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe son of a depressed but doting mother ([[Hope Davis]]) and a father who is serving time for [[tax evasion]], wealthy teenager Charlie Bartlett ([[Anton Yelchin]]) \u2014 after being expelled from several private academies for various infractions \u2014 enrolls in a public school run by embittered alcoholic Principal Nathan Gardner ([[Robert Downey Jr.]]), who was formerly a history teacher. Unable to fit in with most of his fellow students, Charlie is diagnosed with [[ADHD]]. He forms an alliance with school bully Murphy Bivens ([[Tyler Hilton]]) and offers him half the proceeds from the sale of a variety of prescription [[drug]]s Charlie obtains by feigning physical and emotional symptoms during sessions with different psychiatrists.\n\nBefore long, Charlie's natural charm and likability positions him as the school's resident therapist, offering advice and drugs within the confines of the boys' bathroom. Charlie's social life noticeably improves as he gains the confidence and admiration of the student body and begins to date the principal's rebellious daughter, Susan ([[Kat Dennings]]).\n\nComplications arise when seriously depressed Kip Crombwell ([[Mark Rendall]]) attempts [[suicide]] by swallowing a handful of [[anti-depressant]]s provided by Charlie. Charlie befriends Kip after having an in-depth conversation with Principal Gardner. Charlie discovers Kip is writing a play about adolescent issues and pitches it to Gardner who is, at first, unsure but agrees when Kip says that it would make him less inclined to attempt suicide again. Charlie decides to stop selling drugs to students but continues to provide free therapy.\n\nOne day, Charlie comes by Susan's house to pick her up for a date and he gives her a pharmacy bag. Mr. Gardner comes out and, thinking the bag contains drugs, attempts to grab Susan's to make her go into the house. Charlie warns Mr. Gardner not to touch Susan, but he pushes Charlie instead. Charlie then punches Gardner as a reflex, and even though he tries to apologize, the principal is not forgiving. Susan and Charlie drive off, and the bag turns out to contain a nicotine gum to help Susan quit smoking cigarettes.\n\nThat night, a large group of students are all in the student lounge when the police arrive. They arrest Charlie for assault, the kids riot and trash the lounge building to protest Charlie's arrest and as a result Principal Gardner is fired. Charlie is released, and before the play, stops by Mr. Gardner's house to invite him. Charlie finds Mr. Gardner heavily intoxicated and waving a revolver. They get into a heated argument which culminates in Charlie falling into the pool after attempting to tackle Mr. Gardner, thinking he is about to commit [[suicide]]. Mr. Gardner, appearing sober, comes to his senses and dives into the pool to save Charlie and states that he was not attempting to commit suicide because he has too many responsibilities to do such a thing. They talk over their problems about Charlie's father and Susan, and then go to the play. Mr. Gardner takes up his old job as a history teacher again (and is now much happier), and Charlie finally gains the confidence to visit his father in prison (something he had felt uncomfortable about earlier in the film). The film ends with Charlie applying for a summer internship at a psychiatric institute.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Anton Yelchin]] as Charlie Bartlett\n* [[Kat Dennings]] as Susan Gardner\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Nathan Gardner\n* [[Tyler Hilton]] as Murphy Bivens\n* [[Hope Davis]] as Marilyn Bartlett\n* [[Mark Rendall]] as Kip Crombwell\n* [[Jake Epstein]] as Dustin Lauderbach\n* [[Megan Park]] as Whitney Drummond\n* [[Lauren Collins]] as Kelly\n* [[Derek McGrath]] as Superintendent Sedgwick\n* [[Stephen Young (actor)|Stephen Young]] as Dr. Stan Weathers\n* Abby Zotz as Mrs. Crombwell\n* [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]] as A/V Jones\n* [[Sarah Gadon]] as Priscilla\n* Dylan Taylor as Len Arbuckle\n}}\n\nThe film features four of the then ''[[Degrassi: The Next Generation|Degrassi]]'' cast members as Charlie's fellow students: [[Jake Epstein]] ([[Craig Manning]]), [[Lauren Collins]] ([[Paige Michalchuk]]), [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]] ([[Jimmy Brooks]]), and [[Ishan Dav\u00e9]] (Linus).\n\n==Production==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2010}}<!-- plz see WP:FILMPROD -->\nThe film was shot on location in [[Toronto]] as well as at [[Parkwood Estate]] in [[Oshawa]], Ontario and [[Trafalgar Castle School]] in [[Whitby, Ontario|Whitby]], Ontario.

But as it dashes around and eventually turns soft, it loses its train of thought ... [and] never coalesces into the character-driven, serious comedy with heart that you want it be.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/2008/02/22/movies/22char.html ''New York Times'' review]</ref>\n\n[[David Wiegand]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' commented: \"The script is adequate, although screenwriter Nash has created one distasteful character after another, and there's barely a ripple of relieving humor in the entire film&nbsp;... The material might have worked better if the filmmakers had adopted a satirical tone, or even if they'd gone the whole ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' route. Instead, the film grinds on with only a few bright moments. The big problem, though, isn't the script but rather the direction and, specifically, the plodding pace of the film. That's surprising, given that first-time director Jon Poll has a background in film editing. It may have something to do with knowing pretty much what will happen from one moment to the next, but you keep wanting Poll and his cast to get on with things, or at least, energize the film some way or another. The tone is often just turgid&nbsp;... Yet, for all its problems, the film is often sincere, often earnest&nbsp;... You'll find yourself rooting for the filmmakers in spite of yourself, and, more to the point, in spite of the mistakes they've made.\"<ref>{{cite web |author= David Wiegand |url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/22/DDNVUTBMM.DTL |title= Review: 'Charlie Bartlett,' teenage misfit |newspaper= San Francisco Chronicle |date= 2008-02-22 |access-date= 2012-11-07}}</ref>\n\nJonathan Rosenbaum of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' called the film \"a rebellious teen comedy that isn't as good or as radical as ''[[Pump Up the Volume (film)|Pump Up the Volume]],'' but still feels like a shot in the arm and is full of irreverent energy.\" He added, \"Despite an ineffectual subplot about the hero's absent father, there are some good satirical riffs here on adult hypocrisies (with Robert Downey Jr. especially good as the beleaguered, alcoholic school principal), a few echoes of the underrated ''[[Mumford (film)|Mumford]]'', and lots of high spirits.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Rosenbaum |first=Jonathan |url=http://onfilm.chicagoreader.com/movies/capsules/32801_CHARLIE_BARTLETT |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130410170001/http://onfilm.chicagoreader.com/movies/capsules/32801_CHARLIE_BARTLETT |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 10, 2013 |title=''Chicago Reader'' review |publisher=Onfilm.chicagoreader.com |access-date=2012-11-07 }}</ref>\n\nDarrell Hartmann of the ''[[New York Sun]]'' said, \"John Poll's rebellious-teen comedy falls well below the high bar set by recent genre hits ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'' and ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]].''

Bartlett's drug selling, it turns out, is not the main subject of the movie; 'messed-up people' are, and this causes Charlie Bartlett to lean on psychobabble about disaffection that it initially tries so hard to mock. The film's use of [[Cat Stevens]]'s [[anthem]] from ''[[Harold and Maude]],'' 'If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out,' encapsulates its problems; instead of acting as a wry expression of Bartlett's dark philosophy, the song becomes the kind of pat message of self-empowerment that drives teens to Prozac in the first place.\"<ref>{{cite web |author=Originally published February 2008 |url=http://www.torontolife.com/features/february-22-28/?pageno=2 |title=''Toronto Life'' review |publisher=Torontolife.com |date=2012-03-26 |access-date=2012-11-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216014753/http://www.torontolife.com/features/february-22-28/?pageno=2 |archive-date=2012-02-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n{{Anchor|DVD release|Video|DVD}} \n[[MGM Home Entertainment]] released the film on Region 1 DVD on June 24, 2008.
