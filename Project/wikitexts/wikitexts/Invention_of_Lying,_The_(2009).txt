The film stars Gervais as the first human with the ability to lie in a world where people can only tell the truth. The cast also includes [[Jennifer Garner]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[Louis C.K.]], [[Jeffrey Tambor]], [[Fionnula Flanagan]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] and [[Tina Fey]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 14, 2009 and was released in the United States on October 2, 2009 by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and [[Focus Features]]. It grossed $32.7 million against a $18.5 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set in an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternative reality]] in which lying does not exist and people are straightforward about what they think and feel.\n\nMark Bellison is a [[screenwriter]], in a film industry limited to historical readings because there is no fiction. One night he has a date with the beautiful and wealthy Anna McDoogles. She tells Mark she is not attracted to him, because of his looks and failing financial situation, but is going out with him as a favor to his best friend, Greg Kleinschmidt.\n\nThe next day, Mark is fired from his job because of the lack of interest in his films (which are set in the lackluster 14th century), and his landlord threatens to evict him for not paying his rent. Crestfallen, he goes to the bank to close his account. The teller informs him that the computers are down and asks him how much money he has in his account. Mark then has an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] that enables him to tell the world's first lie, which is that he has $800\u2014the amount he owed his landlord\u2014in his account. He then lies in a variety of other circumstances, initially for personal gain; he prevents a police officer from arresting Greg for [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]], convinces a stranger to have casual sex with him to prevent the end of the world (but fakes a call from NASA confirming the world has been saved after deciding that this was exploitative), [[Breaking the bank|breaks the bank]] at a casino, and writes a [[screenplay]] about the world being invaded by aliens in the 14th century that ends with the claim that everyone's memories were erased. He becomes wealthy from the film's success. Mark soon realises that lying can also be used to help others, such as stopping his depressive neighbour Frank Fawcett from committing suicide. Soon after, Mark convinces Anna to go out with him again. She congratulates Mark for his financial success and admits that he would be a good husband and father, but she is still not attracted to him due to how his genetics and appearance would not be a good factor in what she wants her child to be and look like.\n\nMark then gets a call that his mother, Martha, has had a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and rushes to the hospital. There, the doctor tells him that Martha is going to die. She is scared of death, believing that it will bring an [[Eternal oblivion|eternity of nothingness]]. Mark, through tears, tells her that death instead brings a joyful [[afterlife]] and she dies happy. Mark soon receives worldwide attention as the news of his supposed information about death spreads. After encouragement from Anna, he tells the world, through ten main points, that he talks to a \"Man In The Sky\" who controls everything and promises great rewards in the good place after death, as long as you do no more than three \"bad things\".\n\nSome time later, Anna and Mark are together in a park and Anna asks him, if they marry, if his now being rich and famous would make their children more physically attractive. Mark wants to lie, but does not because of his love for Anna, and says \"No\". Meanwhile, Mark's rival, Brad Kessler, pursues Anna romantically, motivated by his jealousy at Mark's success. Though Brad's selfish and cruel manner makes Anna uncomfortable, she continues dating him and they become engaged. Before the wedding, Greg appears and convinces Mark that he has not missed his chance with Anna. Mark reluctantly attends Anna and Brad's wedding, where he objects to the marriage. The officiant, however, informs him that only the Man in the Sky can stop the wedding. Brad and Anna both ask Mark to ask the Man in the Sky what Anna should do, but Mark refuses to say anything and leaves, wanting Anna to choose for herself. Anna walks out and Mark confesses his ability to lie. Anna struggles to understand the concept and asks why he did not lie to convince her to marry him; Mark states that it \"wouldn't count\". Anna confesses that she loves him.\n\nSome time later, Anna and Mark are shown happily married with a son, who appears by his actions to have inherited his father's ability to lie.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as Mark Bellison\n* [[Jennifer Garner]] as Anna McDoogles\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Frank Fawcett\n* [[Louis C.K.]] as Greg Kleinschmidt\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Anthony James\n* [[Fionnula Flanagan]] as Martha Bellison\n* [[Rob Lowe]] as Brad Kessler\n* [[Tina Fey]] as Shelley Bailey\n* [[Christopher Guest]] as Nathan Goldfrappe\n* [[Roz Ryan]] as Nurse Barbara\n* [[Jimmi Simpson]] as Bob Scott\n* [[Shaun Williamson]] as Richard Bellison\n* [[Bobby Moynihan]] as Bellison's Assistant\n* [[Dreama Walker]] as Receptionist\n* [[Ashlie Atkinson]] as Bank Teller\n* [[Donald Foley]] as Yelling Man\n* [[Martin Starr]] as Waiter\n* [[Ruben Santiago-Hudson]] as Landlord\n* [[John Hodgman]] as Wedding Overseer\n* [[Nate Corddry]] as News Reporter\n* [[Stephanie March]] as Blonde Woman on the Street\n* [[Matthew Robinson (director)|Matthew Robinson]] as Person #4\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Doctor (cameo)\n* [[Stephen Merchant]] as Man at the Door (cameo)\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Jim The Bartender (cameo)\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Traffic Cop (cameo)\n* [[Karl Pilkington]] as Cave Man (cameo)\n* [[Eric Andr\u00e9]] as Mansion Man (cameo)\n* Donna Sorbello as Anna's mother\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Matthew Robinson (director)|Matthew Robinson]]'s script which was titled ''This Side of Truth'' at the time, was included in 2007 official [[Black List (survey)|Black List]] of the \u201cmost liked\u201d un-produced scripts in Hollywood.<ref name=BlackList>{{cite web |title=2007 Black List |url=https://ed1055efa47d74815ce0-826e8a392aaf48b70eb85d8703df9872.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/2007_black_list.pdf |publisher=The Black List, LLC |quote=10th rank with 10 mentions |access-date=2018-01-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107120223/https://ed1055efa47d74815ce0-826e8a392aaf48b70eb85d8703df9872.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/2007_black_list.pdf |archive-date=2018-01-07 }}</ref> Robinson and producer [[Lynda Obst]] sent Ricky Gervais the script out of the blue in the hopes that it would spark his interest. Gervais loved it and eventually flew Robinson to London to retool the script and make the movie. Robinson\u2019s original idea for a feature film grew from a skit he wrote about two people on a date who do not have the ability to lie. He later expanded on the idea for more skits with the same premise and then adapted them into a full film script.<ref>[http://www.ifc.com/2015/05/15-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-the-invention-of-lying 15 THINGS WE BET YOU DIDN\u2019T KNOW ABOUT THE INVENTION OF LYING]</ref>\n\n[[Media Rights Capital]] and Radar Pictures financed the film.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Invention of Lying |url=https://variety.com/2009/film/markets-festivals/the-invention-of-lying-1200477113/ |magazine=Variety.com |first=Justin |last=Chang |date=2009-10-01 |access-date=2018-01-07}}</ref> However, 1821 Pictures sued Radar Pictures for breach of contract over failure to pay a $450,000 production fee.<ref>{{cite web |title=Film Co.
