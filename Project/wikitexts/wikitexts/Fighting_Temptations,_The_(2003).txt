Patterson, and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[MTV Films]]. The main plot revolves around Darrin Hill ([[Cuba Gooding Jr.]]) who travels to his hometown of Monte Carlo, Georgia as he attempts to revive a church choir in order to enter a gospel competition with the help of a beautiful lounge singer and childhood friend, Lilly ([[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles]]), with whom he falls in love.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Fighting Temptations|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0191133/|publisher=IMDb|access-date=25 May 2012}}</ref> Through the choir's music, Darrin brings the church community back together all the while seeking a relationship with Lilly.\n\nThe film is notable for its soundtrack and [[ensemble cast|ensemble]] cast. The film received mixed reviews upon release.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1980, young Darrin Hill and his mother, MaryAnn, are run out of their hometown of Monte Carlo, Georgia, after MaryAnn is soon discovered to be singing secular R&B music while also singing in their church's choir. After being confronted about this by the self-righteous and domineering Paulina Pritchett, MaryAnn is forced to choose between singing professionally or remaining in the choir. MaryAnn chooses the former, and she and Darrin are last seen on a bus saying goodbye to their beloved Aunt Sally, as they sadly wave to each other.\n\nIn 2003, Darrin has grown up to become a successful advertising executive in [[New York City]] with a bad habit of lying; MaryAnn is later revealed to have died in a hit-and-run accident when he was a teenager. His secretary and only loving, true friend, Rosa Lopez, does a good job at keeping his credit problems under control. However, Darrin has achieved so much under false pretenses, having faked his college degree and high school diploma and lied about being the son of a congressman. Eventually, his lies soon catch up with him and get him in trouble with his paranoid boss, resulting in Darrin\u2018s termination. After being tracked down by a private investigator, Darrin finds out that Aunt Sally has died.\n\nDarrin returns to Monte Carlo and upon arrival, finds new friendships in Paulina\u2019s grandson Jimmy B. and Lucious, the town's happy-go-lucky, womanizing cab driver. After Aunt Sally's funeral, Darrin learns from Reverend Paul Lewis, the church's pastor and Paulina's brother, that Aunt Sally had stated in her will that he must direct the church choir and enter the annual \"Gospel Explosion\" competition and win the prize money of $10,000 and in doing so, will inherit Aunt Sally's stock in the company that produces the show which is currently worth $150,000. This however, does not sit well with Paulina, as she had originally been next in line after Sally to become choir director.\n\nUpon taking charge of the once-powerful choir, Darrin discovers that it has fallen into decline over the years, with only a handful of members remaining. After several setbacks, Darrin eventually recruits many new members, most of which he does so by promising half of the competition's prize money to them (though he has no intention of actually paying anyone). He also reconnects with his childhood friend and crush Lilly, who has faced ostracization from the townspeople similar to MaryAnn's, due to her being an R&B [[nightclub singer]], and having a son, Dean, out of wedlock. Lilly at first refuses to join the choir as she is both put off by Darrin's romantic advances and because she doesn't want to deal with the townpeople's criticism of her, but with some assurance from Darrin, she ultimately relents and becomes the choir's new lead singer, causing Paulina to quit in retaliation.\n\nSeveral weeks later, Paulina reveals that Darrin failed to enter the choir into the auditions on time. Luckily, the audition judge, Luther Washington, who is also the town's prison warden, lets them perform in a show for his prisoners when their booked act cancels. Thanks to Lilly's beautiful looks and voice, the choir performs well and Washington lets them into the competition. Washington also lets Darrin borrow three convicts, Bee-Z Briggs, Lightfoot, and Mr. Johnson, who can sing and rap.\n\nAfter weeks of success, the choir has become more popular, as more people have joined both it and the church. Lilly starts to trust Darrin and develops romantic feelings for him as well. However, Paulina takes a message for Darrin in a phone call from Rosa and learns of his past troubles. The next afternoon at a church barbecue, Paulina deliberately reveals Darrin's secrets with a polite demeanor in order to make herself look innocent. Lilly, furious that Darrin had been using her all along, coldly tells him that she doesn't care what he does, and the choir members whom Darrin promised money to begin to panic and become angry at him for his lies. Darrin, however, rebukes them for their hypocrisy of joining the choir just to get paid, as well as the rest of the churchgoers for running him and his mother out of town all those years ago simply over her decision to pursue her singing dreams.\n\nSince Lilly wants nothing to do with him now, Darrin quits and returns to New York, where he has been offered his job back with a promotion. However, shortly after Darrin gets the promotion and a new condo, he comes to realize that none of these things mean anything without Lilly and the choir. Darrin quits his job and returns to Monte Carlo to reconcile with Lilly instead. Afterwards, the two recruit Lucious and the Reverend, and they all rush down to the Gospel Explosion to join the choir for the performance.\n\nWhen Darrin and Lilly arrive, Paulina, having taken over as director, tries to keep them out, citing that Darrin forfeited his inheritance when he left Monte Carlo. However, Reverend Lewis finally stands up to Paulina and calls her out for being a selfish, conniving, hypocritical individual. He then reveals to the choir that her husband, whom she previously had claimed was deceased, is alive and remarried to a better woman. Lilly scolds Paulina for insulting Sally's will and wishes, which gave Darrin the choir. They manage to convince the others to vote Paulina out of the choir, giving Darrin his position as director back.\n\nBefore their performance begins, Darrin tells Lilly that she inspired him to name the choir The Fighting Temptations. After giving an outstanding performance, the choir wins the competition, but before ending his acceptance speech, Darrin starts a proper relationship with Lilly by surprising her with an unexpected marriage proposal, which she accepts. Eighteen months later, the two are shown to be happily married with a baby of their own. In addition, the church is about to undergo an expansion, and Paulina has returned to the choir after seemingly reforming her ways.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] as Darrin Hill\n** Nigel Washington as young Darrin Hill\n* [[Beyonc\u00e9|Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles]] as Lilly\n** [[Chloe Bailey]] as young Lilly\n* [[Mike Epps]] as Lucious\n* [[Latanya Richardson|LaTanya Richardson]] as Paulina Lewis-Pritchett\n* [[Eddie Levert|Eddie LeVert Sr.]] as Joseph\n* [[Melba Moore]] as Bessie Cooley\n* [[Wendell Pierce]] as Reverend Paul Lewis\n* [[Lou Myers (actor)|Lou Myers]] as Homer T.\n* [[Rue McClanahan]] as Nancy Stringer\n* [[Angie Stone]] as Alma\n* Mitchah Williams as Jimmy B.\n* [[The O'Jays|Walter Williams Sr.]] as Frank\n* [[Lady Tambourine|Rosalie Washington]] as Faye Jenkins\n* [[Mickey Jones]] as Scooter\n* James E.

The film was criticized for its screenplay, rehashed premise and lack of chemistry between actors Gooding and Knowles. The film, nevertheless, opened at #2.
