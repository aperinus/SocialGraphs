The film, presented as a documentary, recounts his period of intense celebrity during the 1920s, including analyses by contemporary intellectuals.\n\nThe film received critical acclaim and was nominated for numerous awards, including the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Costume Design]].\n\n== Style ==\n''Zelig'' was photographed and narrated in the style of 1920s [[black-and-white]] [[newsreel]]s, which are interwoven with archival footage from the era and re-enactments of real historical events. Color segments from the present day include interviews of real cultural figures, such as [[Saul Bellow]] and [[Susan Sontag]], and fictional ones.\n\n== Plot ==\nSet in the 1920s and 1930s, the film concerns Leonard Zelig ([[Woody Allen]]), a nondescript man who has the ability to transform his appearance to that of the people who surround him. He is first observed at a party by [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], who notes that Zelig related to the affluent guests in a refined Boston accent and shared their Republican sympathies, but while in the kitchen with the servants, he adopted a coarser tone and seemed to be more of a Democrat. He soon gains international fame as a \"human [[chameleon]]\".\n\nInterviewed in one of the witness shots, psychologist [[Bruno Bettelheim]] makes the following comment:<ref>{{cite book |first1=Glen O. |last1=Gabbard |author-link1=Glen Gabbard |first2=Krin |last2=Gabbard |title=Psychiatry and the Cinema |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D42m3IIrEDoC |year=1999 |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Publishing]] |location=[[Arlington County, Virginia]] |pages=[https://books.google.com/?id=D42m3IIrEDoC&pg=PA264&dq=%22Bruno+Bettelheim%22%22The+question+of+whether+Zelig+was+a+psychotic+or+merely+neurotic+was+a+question+that+was+endlessly+discussed+among+his+doctors.+Now+I%22 264]-[https://books.google.com/?id=D42m3IIrEDoC&pg=PA265&dq=%22myself+felt+his+feelings+were+really+not+all+that+different+from+the+normal%2C+what+one+would+call+the+well-adjusted%2C+normal+person%2C+only+carried+to+an+extreme+degree%2C+to+an+extreme+extent.+I+myself+felt+that+one+could+really+think+of+him+as+the+ultimate+conformist%22 265] |edition=2nd |isbn=978-0-880-48964-5 |access-date=October 20, 2016 |archive-date=January 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119113449/https://books.google.com/books?id=D42m3IIrEDoC |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|The question of whether Zelig was a [[psychosis|psychotic]] or merely extremely [[neurosis|neurotic]] was a question that was endlessly discussed among his doctors.

I myself felt that one could really think of him as the ultimate [[conformity|conformist]].}}\n\nDr. Eudora Fletcher ([[Mia Farrow]]) is a [[psychiatrist]] who wants to help Zelig with this strange disorder when he is admitted to her hospital.<ref>Eudora Fletcher was the name of the principal of P.S. 99 in Brooklyn, NY, the elementary school Allen attended as a child.</ref> Through the use of [[hypnotism]], she discovers Zelig yearns for approval so strongly that he physically changes to fit in with those around him. Dr. Fletcher eventually cures Zelig of his compulsion to assimilate, but goes too far in the other direction; for a brief period he is so intolerant of others' opinions that he gets into a brawl over whether or not it is a nice day.\n\nDr. Fletcher realizes that she is falling in love with Zelig. Because of the media coverage of the case, both patient and doctor become part of the popular culture of their time. However, fame is the main cause of their division. Numerous women claim that he married and impregnated them, causing a public scandal. The same society that made Zelig a hero destroys him.\n\nZelig's illness returns, and he tries to fit in once more, before he disappears. Dr. Fletcher finds him in [[Germany]] working with the [[Nazism|Nazis]] before the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Together they escape, as Zelig uses his ability to imitate one more time, mimicking Fletcher's piloting skills and flying them back home across the Atlantic upside down. They eventually return to America, where they are proclaimed heroes and marry to live full happy lives.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Woody Allen]] - Leonard Zelig\n** Garrett Brown - Actor Leonard\n* [[Mia Farrow]] - Dr. Eudora Nesbitt Fletcher\n** Ellen Garrison - Older Eudora\n** Marianne Tatum - Actress Eudora\n* [[Patrick Horgan (actor)|Patrick Horgan]] - Narrator\n* Stephanie Farrow - Meryl Fletcher\n** Elizabeth Rothschild - Older Meryl\n* [[Mary Louise Wilson]] - Ruth Zelig\n* Sol Lomita - Martin Geist\n* [[John Rothman]] - Paul Deghuee\n** Sherman Loud - Older Paul\n* [[Deborah Rush]] - Lita Fox\n* [[Willy Holt|Will Holt]] - Rally Chancellor\n* [[Peter McRobbie]] - Workers Rally Speaker\n* [[Mae Questel]] as [[Helen Kane]] (voice)\n}}\n[[Susan Sontag]], [[Irving Howe]], [[Saul Bellow]], [[Ada \"Bricktop\" Smith|Bricktop]], [[Bruno Bettelheim|Dr. Bruno Bettelheim]] and [[John Morton Blum|Professor John Morton Blum]] appear as themselves. <!--names as billed-->\n\n== Production ==\nAllen used newsreel footage, and inserted himself and other actors into it, using [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] technology.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/my-favourite-woody-allen-movie-1|title=My favourite Woody Allen movie|magazine=Time Out|access-date=January 31, 2017|archive-date=December 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209212541/https://www.timeout.com/london/film/my-favourite-woody-allen-movie-1|url-status=dead}} Film critic David Jenkins, who chose ''Zelig'' as his favorite, notes the film's \"footage filmed on antique cameras, recontextualised newsreel, and shrewd use of blue screen technology.\"</ref> To provide an authentic look to his scenes, Allen and cinematographer [[Gordon Willis]] used a variety of techniques, including locating some of the antique film cameras and lenses used during the eras depicted in the film, and simulating damage, such as crinkles and scratches, on the negatives to make the finished product look more like vintage footage.
