The novel is a [[autobiography|semi-autobiographical]] account of B\u00e9gaudeau's experiences as a [[French language]] and [[French literature|literature]] teacher in a middle school in the [[20th arrondissement of Paris]], particularly illuminating his struggles with \"problem children\": Esmerelda (Esmeralda Ouertani), Khoumba (Rachel Regulier), and Souleymane (Franck Ke\u00efta). The film stars B\u00e9gaudeau himself in the role of the teacher.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/26/arts/26iht-26clas.16510301.html |title=Laurent Cantet's 'The Class': Learning to be the future of France |author=Manohla Dargis  |date=26 September 2008 |access-date=19 June 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\nThe film received a [[Unanimity|unanimous]] [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival]], making it the first French film to do so since 1987, when [[Maurice Pialat]] won the award for '' [[Under the Sun of Satan (film)|Under the Sun of Satan]]''. ''The Class'' was also nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]], but lost to ''[[Departures (2008 film)|Departures]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nSet wholly in a secondary school in a working-class district of Paris, where many inhabitants are foreign-born, the film follows the year of a young teacher, Fran\u00e7ois Marin, and the 25 pupils aged 14 or 15 who he takes for an hour each day in French language. A loner, he walks the narrow line between maintaining discipline and gaining co-operation.\n\nFrom the start, wide differences are apparent in the class over standards of dress, deportment, knowledge, and application. A dispute arises over using the imperfect and pluperfect subjunctive, which he admits may be a bit of an affectation and a student questions whether Fran\u00e7ois is gay. When pupils have to read aloud from ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank]]'', a girl called Khoumba refuses because she does not consider it relevant to her life. In private, Fran\u00e7ois forces her to apologize.\n\nSuccess comes when he asks the pupils to write a self-portrait. An assertive girl called Esmeralda reveals that she would like to be a policewoman or failing that, a rapper. A difficult boy called Souleymane, weak in written French, submits his story in an interesting series of photographs (at a parents' evening, his mother cannot understand or speak French). However, after an argument over football teams with Carl, another boy who is problematic, Souleymane insults Fran\u00e7ois and is sent to the head teacher's office.\n\nAt a teachers' conference to decide final placings, Fran\u00e7ois defends Souleymane but his efforts are undermined by the two student representatives at the meeting, Esmeralda and Louise, who behave in a very childish manner. During the next class, despite the confidential nature of the teachers' conference, the two girls tell the others that Fran\u00e7ois had it in for Souleymane. A furious Fran\u00e7ois rebukes the pair, saying they behaved like \"skanks\" ({{Lang-fr|[[Wiktionary:p\u00e9tasse|p\u00e9tasses]]}}). Uproar follows, in which Souleymane, after accidentally hitting Khoumba with his backpack, storms out and is suspended. Later, Khoumba pulls aside Fran\u00e7ois, telling him that if Souleymane is expelled, his father may send him back to his native country, [[Mali]], as punishment. After a disciplinary hearing at which Souleymane is supported by his mother, for whom he has to translate, he is ultimately expelled.\n\nIn the last lesson of the year, Fran\u00e7ois asks each pupil what they have learned over the year. Carl has been inspired by science experiments in his chemistry class, Khoumba has warmed to music and enjoyed learning Spanish, Esmerelda professes to have learned nothing in school but then admits that she has read Plato's [[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']] in her free time. After they have all left the room, a quiet girl called Henriette comes back and despondently claims that she really has not learned anything at all. Outside, an impromptu football match has begun between the pupils and teachers.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois B\u00e9gaudeau]] : Fran\u00e7ois Marin, the French language teacher.\n* Jean-Michel Simonet : the school principal.\n* Burak Ozyilmaz : Burak, top boy of the class.\n* Boubacar Tour\u00e9 : Boubacar, who accuses Marin of being gay.\n* Carl Nanor : Carl, who has been expelled from his previous school.\n* [[Louise Grinberg]] : Louise, top girl of the class and a student delegate.\n* Esmeralda Ouertani : Esmeralda, the other student delegate.\n* Franck Ke\u00efta : Souleymane, whose lack of control leads to him being disciplined.\n* Henriette Kasaruhanda : Henriette, the silent girl who says she has learned nothing.\n* Rachel R\u00e9gulier : Khoumba, the girl who refuses to read.\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Festival de Cannes 2008 Entre les murs 1.jpg|thumb|right|The cast at Cannes Film Festival 2008]]\nThe film was the featured opening night selection at the 46th [[New York Film Festival]] in 2008.\n\nThe film has received critical acclaim, achieving a 95% rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] out of 161 reviews counted, and an average rating of 8.06/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Energetic and bright, this hybrid of documentary style and dramatic plotting looks at the present and future of France through the interactions of a teacher and his students in an inner-city high school.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_class/ |title=The Class (2008) |access-date=19 June 2017 |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] lists ''Entre les murs'' with a rating of 92, based on 31 critics,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Class|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-class|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=13 August 2013}}</ref> making it one of the best reviewed films of the year according to the website.\n\nThe film was warmly reviewed by the critic [[Philip French]] who noted: \"There is a remarkable French tradition of school films, extending from [[Jean Vigo]]'s ''[[Z\u00e9ro de Conduite]]'', to [[Nicolas Philibert]]'s ''[[\u00catre et avoir]]''. [[Laurent Cantet]], whose parents were both teachers, carries it on and he elicits marvellous performances... As the teacher at a tough, racially mixed, inner-city school in Paris, Marin ([[Fran\u00e7ois B\u00e9gaudeau]]), neither weary cynic nor wide-eyed idealist, is a decent, determined realist... not a saint, though by the end of the school year he has exhibited some of the necessary qualities.\"<ref>Philip French review, The Observer, 1 March 2009</ref>\n\nThe film appeared on many critics'{{who|date=June 2021}} top ten lists of the best films of 2008.<ref name=mctop08>{{cite web|url=http://www.listsofbests.com/list/57692-metacritic-the-best-reviewed-movies-of-2008 |title=Metacritic: 2008 Film Critic Top Ten Lists |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |access-date=January 11, 2009}}</ref>\n\nFrench researcher and education writer [[Philippe Meirieu]] observed that the film shows a teacher full of leftist good intentions, who nevertheless neglects any mediation and does not use any pedagogy other than a kind of dialogical lecture without any constructed learning situation. The teacher comes to rely on seduction, pressure and sanction without avoiding personal confrontation with some of his pupils. Meirieu is concerned about the reading that can be made of the film, which, by showing the difficulties and the explosive situation that emerges, suggests that there is no alternative or which would reinforces authoritarianism and anti-pedagogism.<ref>[https://www.meirieu.com/ACTUALITE/entrelesmurs_politis.pdf \u00ab Cette \u00e9cole ne ressemble en rien \u00e0 celle que je d\u00e9fends \u00bb] Entretien paru dans POLITIS du 18 septembre 2008</ref><ref>[https://www.meirieu.com/ACTUALITE/entrelesmurs.htm Entre les murs : un film en dehors de l\u2019\u00c9cole], Philippe Meirieu</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n!
