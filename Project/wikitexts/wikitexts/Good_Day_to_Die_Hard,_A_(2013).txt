The film was directed by [[John Moore (director)|John Moore]] and written by [[Skip Woods]], and stars [[Bruce Willis]] as [[John McClane]] in his final film in the franchise due to Willis retiring from acting in 2022.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Albert |first1=Victoria |title=Bruce Willis is \"stepping away\" from his acting career due to aphasia diagnosis, family says |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bruce-willis-aphasia-stepping-away-acting-career/ |website=CBS News |access-date=March 30, 2022 |date=March 30, 2022}}</ref> The main plot finds McClane travelling to [[Russia]] to get his estranged son, Jack, an undercover CIA agent, out of prison. He is soon caught in the crossfire of a global terrorist plot. Alongside Willis, the film also stars [[Jai Courtney]], [[Cole Hauser]], [[Yuliya Snigir|Yulia Snigir]] and [[Sebastian Koch]].\n\nTalks of a fifth ''[[Die Hard]]'' film began before the release of the fourth installment, ''[[Live Free or Die Hard]]'', with Willis affirming that the latter would not be the last in the series, but pre-production did not start until September 2011, when John Moore was officially announced as the director. Filming began in April 2012, primarily in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]].\n\n''A Good Day to Die Hard'' [[Film premiere|premiered]] in [[London]] on January 31, 2013, coinciding with the unveiling of a ''Die Hard'' mural at the Fox Lot,<ref name=\"premiere\">{{cite news|url=http://www.shockya.com/news/2013/02/05/a-good-mural-to-die-hard/|title=A Good Mural to DIE HARD|author=Philip|work=Crave Online|date=February 5, 2013|access-date=February 8, 2013}}</ref> and was released the United States on February 13, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/DieHardMovies/app_151503908244383|title='A Good Day To Die Hard International Release Dates'|website=[[Facebook]]|access-date=October 20, 2012}}</ref> It is the only ''Die Hard'' film to use [[Dolby Atmos|Dolby Atmos Surround Mixing]] and the only one to also be released in [[IMAX]] theaters. ''A Good Day to Die Hard'' was a box office success but received overwhelmingly negative reviews for its implausible action sequences, cinematography, weak plot, clich\u00e9d screenplay, running time, and lack of characterization, although the special effects and Willis' performance were praised. It is the first film produced by [[TSG Entertainment]], since distributor [[20th Century Fox]]'s departure from [[Dune Entertainment]] upon the completion of their distribution contract at the end of 2012.\n\n==Plot==\nIn Moscow, Viktor Chagarin, a high-ranking, corrupt [[Russia]]n official, plans to incriminate former billionaire and government [[whistleblower]] Yuri Komarov in a [[Show trial|rigged trial]] unless he hands over a secret file believed to contain evidence incriminating Chagarin. Separately, Jack McClane, arrested after an assassination attempt, negotiates for a shorter sentence by offering to testify against Komarov.\n\nJack's father, [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] detective [[John McClane]], who has not been in touch with his son for several years, has learned he is in trouble. His daughter, Lucy, drives him to the airport as he flies to Russia to help. As John arrives and approaches the courthouse where Komarov is on trial, a bomb explosion, orchestrated by Chagarin's henchman Alik, occurs in the courthouse, and Jack breaks free with Komarov. Seeing his son, John confronts him, but their dispute is cut short as Alik and his men chase them in an [[MRAP]] through Moscow. John, Jack, and Komarov manage to escape.\n\nHiding in a safe house, John finds out that Jack is a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent and has been on an undercover operation for the past three years. Jack's partner, Mike Collins, demands the file's location from Komarov so the CIA can bring Chagarin down. He eventually agrees on the condition that he and his daughter are given safe passage out of Russia. Collins is eventually shot and killed while the McClanes and Komarov come under heavy gunfire from Chagarin's men, but they escape and make their way to a hotel in the city to get the [[safe deposit box]] key containing the file. There they meet up with Komarov's daughter, Irina, as earlier planned. John grows suspicious of her shifty behavior, and is proven correct when Alik and his men burst in and tie John and Jack up, taking Komarov hostage; Irina confesses to informing on them for the \"millions of dollars\" to be gained. Jack manages to break free of his ties and the two manage to kill most of the guards present. Alik and Irina, with Komarov still their hostage, return in a [[Mil Mi-24]] attack helicopter and try to kill them, but they escape again.\n\nThat night, they steal a car full of weapons, driving to [[Pripyat]], [[Ukraine]], where the safe deposit box with the file is located, only to find that Komarov, Irina, and Alik are already there. In a twist, the file is revealed never to have existed: the safe deposit box with the supposed file is, in fact, a secret passage to a radioactive [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl-era]] vault containing [[euro sign|\u20ac]]1 billion worth of weapons-grade [[Uranium-235|uranium]]. Once inside, Komarov kills Alik and calls Chagarin to gloat and listen as the latter is killed by one of Komarov's men.\n\nAt this point, John and Jack enter the vault, discover Komarov's true plot, and capture him, but Irina and some henchmen come to her father's aid. As they attempt to escape, Jack follows Komarov, while John goes after Irina, who is escaping in a [[Mil Mi-26]] helicopter; he sneaks into the rear compartment. Irina tries to protect her father by firing the helicopter's guns at Jack, but John is able to bring the helicopter off balance by driving a truck, still shackled by a chain, out of the cargo section via the open rear ramp. Komarov taunts Jack by saying he will get to watch his father die, prompting Jack to hurl him off the rooftop and into the path of the spinning helicopter blades, killing him. John is promptly thrown off the truck and into the building right before the truck's chain snaps.\n\nAs Jack and John reunite inside the building, Irina tries to avenge her father by ramming the helicopter, now out of ammunition, into the building in a suicide attack. John and Jack survive by leaping off the building into a large pool of water as the helicopter crashes and explodes, killing Irina. In the end, the McClanes return home and reunite with Lucy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as [[John McClane]]\n* [[Jai Courtney]] as CIA Agent John \"Jack\" McClane Jr.\n* [[Sebastian Koch]] as Yuri Komarov\n* [[Yuliya Snigir|Yulia Snigir]] as Irina Komarov\n* Radivoje Bukvi\u0107 as Alik\n* [[Sergei Kolesnikov (actor)|Sergei Kolesnikov]] as Viktor Chagarin\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] as Lucy McClane\n* [[Cole Hauser]] as CIA Agent Mike Collins\n* [[Aldis Hodge]] as Lieutenant Foxy (Hodge played Raymond in ''[[Die Hard With a Vengeance]]'')\n* [[Amaury Nolasco]] as Detective Murphy\n* [[Megalyn Echikunwoke]] as Pretty Reporter\n* [[Pasha D.
