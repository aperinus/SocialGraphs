Directed by [[Alain Resnais]], it was made ten years after the liberation of [[Nazi concentration camps]]. The title is taken from the ''[[Nacht und Nebel]]'' ([[German language|German]] for \"Night and Fog\") program of abductions and disappearances decreed by Nazi Germany.\nThe documentary features the abandoned grounds of [[Auschwitz]] and [[Majdanek]] established in occupied Poland while describing the lives of prisoners in the camps. ''Night and Fog'' was made in collaboration with scriptwriter [[Jean Cayrol]], a survivor of the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]]. The music of the soundtrack was composed by [[Hanns Eisler]].\n\nResnais was originally hesitant about making the film and refused the offer to make it until Cayrol was contracted to write the script. The film was shot entirely in the year 1955 and is composed of contemporary shots of the camps plus stock footage. Resnais and Cayrol found the film very difficult to make due to its graphic nature and subject matter. The film faced difficulties with French censors unhappy with a shot of a French police officer in the film, and with the German embassy in France, which attempted to halt the film's release at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. ''Night and Fog'' was released to critical acclaim, and still receives very high praise today. It was re-shown on French television nationwide in 1990 to remind the people of the \"horrors of war\".<ref name=\"Knaap35\" />\n\n==Plot==\n''Night and Fog'' is a documentary that alternates between past and present, using both black-and-white and colour footage. The first part of ''Night and Fog'' shows remnants of [[Auschwitz]] while the narrator [[Michel Bouquet]] describes the rise of [[Nazi ideology]]. The film continues with comparisons of the life of the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' to the starving prisoners in the camps. Bouquet shows sadism inflicted upon the doomed inmates, including scientific and medical experiments, executions, and rape. The next section is shown completely in black-and-white, and depicts images of gas chambers and piles of bodies. The final topic of the film depicts the liberation of the country, the discovery of the horror of the camps, and the questioning of who was responsible for them.\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Background and development ===\nFrom 1954 to 1955, a number of activities took place in observance of the tenth anniversary of the liberation of France and of the concentration camps.{{sfn|Eisler|2014|p=xxvi. |ps= As a scholarly volume, the introduction to the Eisler score provides lengthy and ample detail about all stages of the creation and post-production of the film, including subsequent versions produced in Germany.}} One of these was an exhibition curated by Olga Wormser and [[Henri Michel (historian)|Henri Michel]], ''Resistance, Liberation, Deportation'', which opened on 10 November 1954 at the ''Institut P\u00e9dagogique National'' (National Teaching Institute) in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"origins\"/> The exhibit was based on Michel and Wormser's monograph, which had been published earlier in 1954 in a special issue of ''Revue d'histoire de la Deuxi\u00e8me Guerre mondiale''.<ref>No. 15, July\u2013September 1954.</ref><ref>Wormser had been researching concentration camps as far back as 1940. After the war, she collected survivors' testimonies for ''Op\u00e9ration Lutetia'' and helped with the French prosecution for the [[Nuremberg trials]]. In 1952, Henri Michel called on her to join the ''Comit\u00e9 d'histoire de la Deuxi\u00e8me Guerre mondiale'', and she also became a member of the R\u00e9seau du souvenir, an association of former members of the [[French Resistance]] who wanted their efforts commemorated. In 1955, Michel and Wormser published ''Trag\u00e9die de la D\u00e9portation 1940-1945: T\u00e9moignages de survivants des camps de concentration allemands''(Paris: Hachette, 1955).</ref> The first public notice of a proposed film project was given during a radio broadcast on 10 November 1954, the opening day of the exhibition.{{sfn|Lindeperg|2007|p=43}}{{sfn|Eisler|2014|p=xxvi}}\n\nAlthough Michel was under pressure from veterans' organizations to create a film that would honor [[French Resistance]] fighters, Wormser argued for a scholarly approach that would show the concentration camps as a systematic microcosm of the German war economy. Michel recognized that this approach would enable broader financing, and both re-envisioned the film as \"communicating historical research through contemporary media.\"{{sfn|Eisler|2014|p=xxvii}} Initially, Michel thought the film could take the form of a montage of news reports. But as a result of the exhibit ''Resistance, Liberation, Deportation'', both he and Wormser had received many items created by former inmates during their internment. They came to believe that they could create a unique perspective by providing an inside view of the camps.\n\n<blockquote>\"The [[genocide]] of the Jews was treated in French remembrance as more of a side issue\u2014something that was in any case supposedly a matter for the Jews themselves and not for the majority of society. Michel and Wormser might have wanted scholarly objectivity instead of the heroism favoured by the deportees' association...but nevertheless the Holocaust had remained a blind spot even for them.\"{{sfn|Eisler|2014|p=xxvii}}</blockquote>\n\nFilm producers [[Anatole Dauman]], Samy Halfton, and Philippe Lifchitz were invited to this exhibit and felt that a film should be made on the subject.<ref name=\"origins\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Night and Fog |orig-year=1955 |others=[[Alain Resnais]] |type=Booklet essay \"Origins and Controversy\" |publisher=The Criterion Collection |location=New York, United States |id=197 |year=2003 }}</ref> [[Anatole Dauman]], originally from [[Warsaw]], undertook the production for Argos Films and arranged for co-financing by Films Polski, the Polish state production company.{{sfn|Lindeperg|2007|p=43}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Dauman approached filmmaker [[Alain Resnais]], who had experience with [[documentary films]] since 1948.<ref name=\"Barsam262\">Barsam 1992, pg. 262</ref> For more than a week, Resnais resisted the offer, believing that only someone with first-hand experience of concentration camps should attempt the subject matter.\n<ref name=\"Resnais1994\">{{cite AV media notes|title= Night and Fog|orig-year= 1955|type= Audio interview with Resnais from 1994|publisher= [[The Criterion Collection]]|location=  New York, New York|ISBN=  0-7800-2694-2|year= 2003}}</ref>\n\nResnais eventually agreed, providing that poet and novelist [[Jean Cayrol]], who had been a concentration camp prisoner, would collaborate on the project.<ref name=\"Barsam262\" /> Resnais officially signed his contract for the film on 24 May 1955.<ref name=\"Knaap8\">Knaap 2006, pg. 8</ref> Cayrol had written in 1946 about his experience as a survivor of [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]] in ''Po\u00e8mes de la nuit et brouillard'' (\"Poems of night and fog\"), from which the documentary was titled. Resnais intended the film to warn of the horrors of Nazism, which he feared could be repeated during the [[Algerian War]], during which torture and internment were already taking place.<ref name=\"Rashkin\">Rashkin 2008, pg. 83</ref>\n\nThe film was commissioned by two organizations: the first was the ''Comit\u00e9 d'histoire de la Deuxi\u00e8me Guerre mondiale'' (Committee on the history of the Second World War), a government commission assigned the tasks of assembling documentary material on, and of launching historical inquiries and studies of, the period of the French occupation from 1940 to 1945. The second was the ''R\u00e9seau du souvenir'' (Network of memory), an association devoted to the memory of those deported to camps. A pre-production meeting was held on 28 May 1955, during which participants decided \"to explain clearly how the concentration-camp system (its economic aspect) flowed automatically from fascism\". The film's [[working title]], ''Resistance and Deportation'', was changed to the French translation of the German term ''[[Nacht und Nebel]]'' (''Night and Fog''). This was the term for handling [[World War II]] prisoners according to a decree promulgated by [[Himmler]] on 7 December 1941. This decree provided that those resisting [[Nazi Germany|the Reich]], who were arrested in their own countries but not promptly executed, would be deported to camps where they would vanish without a trace, \"into the night and fog\".\n\nAnother layer of meaning is expressed one quarter of the way through the film: [[Hanns Eisler]]'s chilling score, which has accompanied images of deportation, is disrupted as the train arrives at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. The narrator observes that during the train ride, \"death makes its first choice\" and \"a second is made upon arrival in the night and fog\". The visuals [[cut (transition)|cut]] to a shot of trains arriving in night and fog, which has become a metaphor for the mystery of their situation.{{sfn|Lindeperg|2007}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n=== Evolving structure of the film ===\nMichel's and Wormser's 1954 exhibit ''Resistance, Liberation, Deportation'' was organized in nine parts:{{sfn|Eisler|2014|p=xxviii}}\n# The convoys\n# Arrival at the camp and quarantine\n# Daily life; atmosphere in the camp, the locations and camp sites, the schedule, hygiene, diet, a typical day\n# Work in the concentration camps, chores, factory work, secret war factories\n# Social categories in the camps, the SS, prisoner administration, the slaves\n# The permanence of humanity, spiritual life and resistance\n# The sick bay: the anteroom of death, medical organization, the camp pathology, human experiments\n# Death: the last station, \"natural\" death, induced death, massive exterminations\n# The camp evacuations and their liberation\n\nThis was adapted into seven parts for the first draft of the film (dating from late February/early March 1955):{{sfn|Eisler|2014|p=xxviii}}\n# Departure and arrival of the transports\n# Planning and organization of the camp\n# Sketch of the everyday life of a deportee\n# Work in a concentration camp\n# Sick bay and death\n# Escape and resistance\n# Liberation, return, reintegration and commemoration (pilgrimage to the camp)\n\nThe outline of the film changed dramatically when in April 1955, Wormser and Michel went to Poland to attend commemorations for the tenth anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation. They wanted to include film of how Auschwitz was currently seen.  They were approached by Auschwitz museum staff, who supplied  additional documentation and images.  Visiting Poland gave Wormser and Michel the opportunity to make contact with Polish archives. The result was broadening the scope of the film from a nationalist view toward a broader European perspective.{{sfn|Eisler|2014|p=xxix}}\n\nOnce Resnais joined the team, a new script (dated 11 June 1955) emerged with 12 sections:{{sfn|Eisler|2014|p=xxx}}\n# The camp, deserted in 1956 (mixture of the four camps)\n# An \"algebraic\" history of Nazism\n# Himmler's visit to Dachau; All is in place, the mill starts to grind bones\n# The convoys\n# Arrival at the camp\n# Quarantine and daily life\n# The locations of the camp\n# Himmler's second visit; Continuation of the history of Nazism\n# The proliferation of the system\n# The techniques of extermination\n# The evacuation of the camps; What the Allies found\n# The Auschwitz Museum; The lesson to be learned\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe film draws on several sources, including black-and-white still images from various archives, excerpts from older black-and-white films from French, Soviet, and Polish newsreels, footage shot by detainees of the [[Westerbork transit camp|Westerbork]] internment camp in the Netherlands, or by the Allies' \"clean-up\" operations, plus new color and black-and-white footage filmed in 1955 at concentration camps.{{sfn|Eisler|2014|p=xxx-xxxi}} Resnais filmed his color sequences in Eastmancolor rather than Agfacolor, using the footage to contrast the desolate tranquility of several concentration camps \u2014 Auschwitz, Birkenau, Majdanek, Struthof, and Mauthausen \u2014 with the horrific events that occurred there during World War II, to muse on the diffusion of guilt, and to pose the question of responsibility.{{sfn|Lindeperg|2007}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nThe film deals briefly with the conditions of prisoners, and shows disturbing footage of prisoners and dead victims in the camps. While ''Night and Fog'' states that the Nazis made soap from the corpses, giving the possible impression that this was done regularly, this claim is now [[Soap made from human corpses#World War II rumours|considered untrue]], with the exception of isolated cases. Researching and making the film were difficult for Resnais. He suffered nightmares during filming and found himself waking up screaming in the night.<ref name=\"Wilson25\">Wilson 2006, pg. 25</ref> As Resnais began filming on site in Auschwitz, the nightmares ended.<ref name=\"Wilson25\" />\n\nFrom 29 September to 4 October 1955, Resnais and his crew filmed at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]].<ref name=\"Knaap8\" /> They next shot scenes at [[Majdanek]] from 7 to 10 October.<ref name=\"Knaap8\" /> For the archival material, Resnais had to use black-and-white footage, but did not receive any from English, German or French military sources.<ref name=\"Knaap8\" /> Some of the stock footage in the film is from Michel and Wormser's exhibit.<ref name=\"Haggith130\">Haggith 2005, pg. 130</ref> Other stock footage is from the ''Rijksinstituut voor Oorlogsdokumentatie'' (National institute for war documentation) in the [[Netherlands]], and from French television, [[Gaumont Film Company]], and the association of former deportees.<ref name=\"Haggith130\" />\n\nCayrol was aided by mutual friend and film maker [[Chris Marker]] while writing the commentary that was spoken by actor [[Michel Bouquet]].<ref name=\"origins\" /> After viewing the images in the editing room, Cayrol became nauseated and was unable to write further.<ref name=\"Knaap14\">Knaap 2006, pg. 14</ref> Marker's contribution was to adapt the written text to the rhythm of the images in the film.<ref name=\"Knaap15\">Knaap 2006, pg. 15</ref> While editing the film, Resnais felt general discomfort, saying that he \"had scruples, knowing that making the film more beautiful would make it more moving - it upset me\".<ref name=\"nyt2006\">{{Cite web|last=Dupont |first=Joan |title=Resnais, at 84, still doing it his own way - Arts & Leisure - International Herald Tribune |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/07/arts/07iht-fmlede8.2726755.html?_r=1&scp=2&sq=Night%20and%20Fog%20Resnais&st=cse |date=7 September 2006 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=20 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Scoring ===\nOriginally Wormser and Michel had wanted to use the song \"''Chant des Marais''\" ([[Peat Bog Soldiers]]) as a recurring leitmotif, as it was an authentic prisoner song.{{sfn|Eisler|2014|p=xxxi}} When Resnais joined the production team, he proposed having an original composed score.  Chris Marker suggested approaching [[Hanns Eisler]], to which Resnais agreed after hearing a recording of his music. Although concerned that the composer's fee would put the film over budget, producer Dauman was supportive.  Eisler was invited to compose the music by Argos Films on 18 October 1955, which offered him 200,000 [[franc]]s and help in obtaining a visa to enter France.<ref name=\"Knaap22\" /> Resnais also sent Eisler a \"lyrical\" letter.  In what Resnais considered a stroke of luck, Eisler opened the letter in the presence of [[Vladimir Pozner (writer)|Vladimir Pozner]], who was familiar with Resnais and urged Eisler to accept the offer immediately.{{sfn|Eisler|2014|p=xxxi}} Eisler agreed to do it by telegram on 25 October.<ref name=\"Knaap22\">Knaap 2006, pg. 22</ref>\n\nEisler arrived in Paris on 30 November 1955. In a letter to his wife Louise he wrote:\n<blockquote>The film is grandiose, horrible, showing monstrous crimes...regrettably, the film people here are putting me under pressure to finish the whole thing in ten days even though the film is barely finished. I hope I can get it all together. I'm living here like a monk, I go to bed at 8 in the evening, eat and drink very little and don't feel at all at ease in this giant city with all the responsibility for the film.{{sfn|Eisler|2014|p=xxxii|ps=. This source contains much detailed information on Eisler's compositional choices in scoring the film.}}</blockquote>\n\nRecording took place on 19 December 1955. Sound editing was completed on 24 December 1955.{{sfn|Eisler|2014|p=xxxiii}}\n\nThe overture in the score had been written before Eisler was offered work on the film. It had been written for [[Johannes R. Becher]]'s play ''Winterschlacht'' (''Winter Battle''), which had its premiere on 12 January 1955. Eisler's inspiration for this piece was [[Horatio (character)|Horatio]]'s monologue from ''[[Hamlet]]'', which Eisler had read in [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]]' ''Weltgericht''.<ref name=\"Knaap24\">Knaap 2006, pg. 24</ref> Eisler later reworked the overture into his song ''Monolog Horatio's (Hamlet)''.{{sfn|Eisler|2014|p=xxxiv}}\n\nEisler considered the possibility of conceiving of his music to ''Night and Fog'' as a separate orchestral work, although this never came to fruition.{{sfn|Eisler|2014|p=xxxix}} He reused portions of the music for his incidental music to ''The Days of the Commune'' (''Die Tage der Commune'') and ''William Tell'' (''Wilhelm Tell'').{{sfn|Eisler|2014|p=xxxix}}\n\nThe score was published for the first time in 2014 as part of the ''Hanns Eisler Gesamtausgabe (Hanns Eisler Complete Edition)''.{{sfn|Eisler|2014}}\n\n===Post-production and censorship===\n[[File:Night and fog Pithiviers uncensored.jpg|thumb|A still from ''Night and Fog'', showing a French police officer, identifiable by his [[kepi]], guarding the [[Pithiviers internment camp|Pithiviers deportation camp]].

This scene prompted a call demanding that the shot be cut because it \"might be offensive in the eyes of the present-day military\".<ref name=Wilson>Emma Wilson, ''Alain Resnais'', French film directors (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2006), p25</ref> Resnais resisted this censorship, insisting that images of collaboration were important for the public to see.<ref name=Wilson/> When Resnais refused to cut the French officer scene, the censors threatened to cut the last ten minutes of his film.<ref name=\"Resnais1994\" /> Finally in compromise, Resnais said that obscuring the contested scene would not change the meaning of the film to him. He painted a fake support beam to obscure the distinctive [[k\u00e9pi]] worn by the French officer.<ref name=\"Resnais1994\" /> In exchange, Resnais was allowed to show the bodies of victims at the end of the film. The censored scene was restored to its original form for a 2003 DVD release.{{sfn|Lindeperg|2007}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nThe second{{when|date=December 2016}} attempted censorship of the film arose when the German embassy in France asked for the film to be withdrawn from the [[Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Knaap39\">Knaap 2006, pg. 39</ref> The French press reacted negatively to the proposed withdrawal, noting that Cayrol and Resnais had been careful to define the difference between Nazi criminals and the German people.<ref name=\"Knaap39\" /> Articles were written in French magazines including ''[[Lib\u00e9ration]]'' and ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'', protesting any censorship of the film at Cannes.<ref name=\"Knaap39\" /> One of the few writers who supported the withdrawal, [[Jean Dutourd]], felt that Auschwitz and other concentration camps should be forgotten.<ref name=\"Knaap39\" />\n\n==Release==\nA local association of former deported prisoners insisted that the film be shown at Cannes, threatening to occupy the screening room in their camp uniforms unless the festival showed the film.<ref name=\"nyt2006\" /> On 26 April 1956 the film was announced to be shown out of competition at Cannes.<ref name=\"Knaap40\">Knaap 2006, pg. 40</ref> ''Night and Fog'' was shown in commercial theaters in Paris, in May 1956.<ref name=\"Knaap36\">Knaap 2006, pg. 36</ref> The film was awarded the 1956 [[Prix Jean Vigo|Jean Vigo Prize]], a French award for young filmmakers.<ref name=\"Knaap40\" />\n\n''Night and Fog'' was shown on French television as early as 26 April 1959.<ref name=\"Knaap36\" />\n\nOn 10 May 1990 a [[Jewish cemetery]] at [[Carpentras]] was desecrated, and the body of a freshly buried man, Felix Germont, impaled on a stake.<ref name=\"Knaap35\">Knaap 2006, pg. 35</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=''Le proc\u00e8s de quatre profanateurs n\u00e9o-nazis apr\u00e8s six ans de fausses pistes'' |url=https://www.humanite.fr/popup_imprimer.html?id_article=774664 |date=17 March 1997 |work=[[L'Humanit\u00e9]] |author=Smadja, Gilles |access-date=20 July 2009 |language=fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015201524/http://www.humanite.fr/popup_imprimer.html?id_article=774664 |archive-date=15 October 2008 }}</ref> Response was strong to this act.
