It was written and directed by [[Tom DiCillo]] and narrated by [[Johnny Depp]]. The film begins with the band's formation in 1965, its development over the next two years, the release of their [[The Doors (album)|debut album]] and subsequent albums and [[Jim Morrison]]'s use of alcohol and drugs and subsequent death in Paris in July 1971. The film features archival footage of rehearsals, TV and concert performances, private cine-film and the background to Morrison's arrest at a 1969 Miami concert and later trial.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/7866277/When-Youre-Strange-review.html |title=When You're Strange, review |author=David Gritten |newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date=July 1, 2010 |access-date=December 9, 2018 }}</ref> The film also includes the first public release of material from Morrison's 1969 film ''[[HWY: An American Pastoral]]''.<ref name=\"Strange\">{{cite web |last=Cohen |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/doors-documentary-revisits-strange-days-1003923868.story |title=Doors Documentary Revisits 'Strange' Days |website=[[Billboard.com]] |date=December 18, 2008}}</ref>\n\nDoors' keyboardist [[Ray Manzarek]] who was not pleased with the [[The Doors (film)|1991 biopic film]], stated that \"This will be the true story of the Doors,\"<ref name=\"Strange\"/><ref name=\"Eyes\">{{cite web |last=Prato |first=Greg  |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1045280/manzarek-eyes-doors-documentary-other-projects |title=Manzarek Eyes Doors Documentary, Other Projects |website=Billboard.com |date=May 27, 2008}}</ref> and that the film will be \"the anti-[[Oliver Stone]].\"<ref name=\"Strange\"/><ref name=\"Eyes\"/>\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Jim Morrison]] as himself (archive footage) \u2013 vocalist of The Doors\n*[[Ray Manzarek]] as himself (archive footage) \u2013 keyboardist of The Doors\n*[[John Densmore]] as himself (archive footage) \u2013 percussionist of The Doors\n*[[Robby Krieger]] as himself (archive footage) \u2013 guitarist of The Doors\n*[[Paul A.

Due to the rash of complaints about the narration, [[Johnny Depp]] was hired to redub it. A few months later, DiCillo pronounced the film \"just about locked\" and announced that there would be a showing of the new \"redux\" version. It debuted at the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]] on Sunday, June 21, 2009.\n\nThe completed film was also shown at the [[London Film Festival]] on October 16\u201318, 2009.
