The film stars [[Chris Pratt]], [[Bryce Dallas Howard]], [[Vincent D'Onofrio]], [[Ty Simpkins]], [[Nick Robinson (American actor)|Nick Robinson]], [[Omar Sy]], [[BD Wong]], and [[Irrfan Khan]]. Set 22 years after the events of ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993), ''Jurassic World'' takes place on the same fictional island of [[Isla Nublar]], located off the Pacific coast of [[Costa Rica]]. A successful [[Animal theme park|theme park]] of [[Cloning|cloned]] [[dinosaurs]], dubbed Jurassic World, has operated on the island for years, bringing [[John Hammond (character)|John Hammond]]'s dream to fruition. The park plunges into chaos when a [[Transgene|transgenic]] dinosaur escapes from its enclosure and goes on a rampage, while a conspiracy orchestrated by the park's staff creates more dangers.\n\n[[Universal Pictures]] intended to begin production of a fourth ''Jurassic Park'' film in 2004 for a mid-2005 release but was in [[development hell]] while the script underwent several revisions. Following a suggestion from executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]], writers Jaffa and Silver explored the idea of a functional dinosaur park. Once Trevorrow was hired as director in 2013, he followed the same idea while developing a new script with Connolly. Filming lasted from April to August 2014 in [[Louisiana]] and [[Hawaii]]. The dinosaurs were created by Lucasfilm's [[Industrial Light & Magic]] using [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] and by [[Legacy Effects]] using life-sized [[animatronics]]. Production was completed in May 2015.<ref name=SC-2015/>\n\n''Jurassic World'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 12, 2015, by Universal Pictures. It was praised by critics, with many considering it to be the best Jurassic Park sequel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/jurassic-park-world-movies-ranked-worst-best/|title=Every Jurassic Park & World Movie Ranked From Worst To Best|author-last=Kennedy|author-first=Michael|date=June 17, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Alex Vo |url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/jurassic-park-world-movies/ |title=All Jurassic Park and World Movies Ranked by Tomatometer |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/jurassic-park-movies-ranked-worst-to-best/|title=All the 'Jurassic Park' Movies Ranked from Worst to Best |author-last=Nemiroff |author-first=Perri |date=June 10, 2022 }}</ref> It grossed $1.6 billion in box office revenue, becoming the third [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of all time]] at the time of its release.

Claire assigns her assistant Zara as the boys' guide, but they evade her and explore on their own. Elsewhere on the island, [[United States Navy|Navy]] veteran and [[Ethology|ethologist]] [[Owen Grady]] has been training a ''[[Velociraptor]]'' squad composed of Blue, Charlie, Delta and Echo, and researching their intelligence. Based on the raptors' ability to follow commands, head of [[Jurassic Park#InGen|InGen]] security [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Vic Hoskins|Vic Hoskins]] believes that the animals can be weaponized, an idea Owen and his assistant [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Barry Semb\u00e8ne|Barry]] vehemently oppose.\n\nPrior to its opening, Claire and park owner [[Simon Masrani]] inspect the park's newest attraction, the ''Indominus rex'', a [[Transgene|transgenic]] dinosaur created by geneticist [[Henry Wu (character)|Dr. Henry Wu]]. Masrani tasks Owen with evaluating the enclosure's security. Owen warns Claire that the ''Indominus'' lacks social skills, making it dangerous and unpredictable. When the ''Indominus'' seemingly escapes her compound, Owen and two park workers enter the enclosure. The ''Indominus'', which can [[camouflage]] itself and [[Multi-spectral camouflage|mask its heat signature]], suddenly appears. Owen survives, but it devours the other two men before escaping into the island's interior. Realizing that it is highly vicious and intelligent, Owen advises Masrani to have the specimen destroyed, but to protect his company's investment, Masrani dispatches a specialized unit to subdue it with non-lethal weaponry so that it can safely be returned to its paddock. After most of the unit is slaughtered, Claire orders the evacuation of the island's northern sector, while Masrani ponders Owen's warning and accosts Wu.\n\nWhile exploring the park in a tour vehicle, Zach and Gray enter a restricted area. The ''Indominus'' arrives and destroys the vehicle, but the boys narrowly escape. They find the ruins of the original Jurassic Park visitor center, repair an old [[Jeep Wrangler]], and drive back to the park resort. As Claire and Owen search for the boys, they barely escape the ''Indominus'' as well. Masrani and two troopers hunt down the ''Indominus'' by helicopter, but it breaks into the park's aviary. The [[Pteranodon]]s and [[Dimorphodon]]s, startled by the ''Indominus'', flee the aviary and attack Masrani's helicopter, resulting it in crashing and killing its passengers, before converging onto the resort, and attacking everyone, including Zara who is then devoured by a ''[[Mosasaurus]]''. Zach and Gray find Owen and Claire at the resort as armed personnel shoot down the pterosaurs.\n\nAssuming command, Hoskins orders the raptors to be used to track the ''Indominus'', whereupon Owen reluctantly complies and spearheads the assault with the raptors. Upon finding the ''Indominus'', the dinosaurs begin communicating among themselves. Owen realizes that the ''Indominus'' has ''Velociraptor'' [[DNA]], and it usurps Owen's command of the raptors, becoming the pack's new [[Alpha (ethology)|alpha]]. Troops fire on the ''Indominus'', but it escapes. The raptors slaughter most of the soldiers, while Charlie is killed in the chaos. Hoskins evacuates Dr. Wu and the dinosaur embryos from the island to protect Dr. Wu's research. Owen, Claire, and the boys find Hoskins at the lab securing more embryos, but Delta breaks in and kills him. Owen re-establishes his bond with the three surviving raptors before the ''Indominus'' reappears. They attack the hybrid, but Delta and Echo are killed while Blue is knocked unconscious. Claire releases the Jurassic Park\u2019s veteran ''[[Rexy|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' from its paddock and lures it into a battle with the ''Indominus''. The ''Indominus'' eventually gains the advantage over the ''Tyrannosaurus'' until Blue recovers and joins the battle. The duo overwhelms the ''Indominus'' until it gets cornered at the lagoon's edge, where it is dragged underwater by the resident ''Mosasaurus''.\n\nThe survivors are evacuated and the island is abandoned once again. Zach and Gray are reunited with their parents, while Owen and Claire decide to stay together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 500\n| direction = horizontal\n| align   = right\n| image1  = Chris Pratt 2018.jpg\n| image2  = Bryce Dallas Howard June 2018.jpg\n| image3  = BDWongNYCJune08.jpg\n| footer  = (L&C) [[Chris Pratt]] and [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] play the film's two leads, while [[BD Wong]] (R) reprises his role as [[Dr. Henry Wu]] from the [[Jurassic Park (film)|first film]].\n}}\n{{main|List of Jurassic Park characters}}\n<!-- DO NOT MODIFY THE ORDER OF THE CAST LIST!
