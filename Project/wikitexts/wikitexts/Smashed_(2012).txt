Winstead and Paul play a married couple, Kate and Charlie Hannah, both [[alcoholic]]s. After a series of embarrassing incidents caused by her drinking habit, Kate decides to get sober with the help of a coworker and a sponsor from [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].\n\nThe script was partly based on Burke's own experience of giving up alcohol at a young age, since she felt that her narrative had not yet been told on film. She and Ponsoldt wrote the script over six months, and the main roles were cast in September 2011. The film's US$500,000 budget was financed by independent investors including [[Minnesota Vikings]] owner [[Zygi Wilf]]. It was shot in Los Angeles in October 2011. It premiered at the [[2012 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 22, 2012 and was released by [[Sony Pictures Classics]] on October 12, 2012. The film received positive reviews, with Winstead's performance receiving unanimous praise, and was nominated for several awards for her acting.\n\n==Plot==\nKate Hannah ([[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]]), an elementary school teacher, arrives at work hungover and vomits in front of her class. Asked by a student if she is pregnant, she pretends she is, then continues the lie to the school principal, Mrs. Barnes ([[Megan Mullally]]). Her co-worker Dave ([[Nick Offerman]]) reveals that he knows she has been drinking and she makes him swear not to tell anyone.\n\nAttending a party with her husband Charlie ([[Aaron Paul]]) and his brother Owen ([[Kyle Gallner]]), Kate drinks heavily. While leaving, she meets a woman who asks Kate for a ride. Kate is offered [[Crack cocaine|crack]] and the two get high together. The next morning, Kate wakes alone on the street. She finds her car and drives home, where Charlie acknowledges they both are [[alcoholics]]. They get intoxicated and have sex before Charlie passes out. Kate heads out alone to buy wine but is turned down by the cashier. She urinates on the floor because the bathroom door is locked, then steals a bottle of wine.\n\nWaking up, Kate realizes she has passed out again. At work, Dave, a recovering alcoholic, invites her to an [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (AA) meeting. There, she befriends Jenny ([[Octavia Spencer]]), who has chosen a passion for food and cooking over alcohol. Kate decides to become sober and change her life. Dave drives Kate home, but bluntly makes an offensive comment which upsets her. When Kate and Charlie visit her estranged alcoholic mother, Rochelle ([[Mary Kay Place]]), Kate mentions the AA meetings but Rochelle is skeptical; Kate's father left them after getting sober and now lives in another state with his \"shiny new family\".\n\nKate is surprised the next day when she is thrown a baby shower by her colleagues. She reconciles with Dave, putting his comments behind them. At home, Kate is angry when it becomes clear Charlie told Owen and his friend about Kate smoking crack. That night, she rebuffs Charlie's sexual advances. At school, Kate is questioned by a curious student as to why she is not gaining weight. She subsequently feigns a miscarriage and her students accuse her of killing her baby, for which she reprimands them.\n\nKate tells Charlie she feels she must confess to Mrs. Barnes the truth about her faked pregnancy. Charlie discourages her, warning that she will lose her job, and they begin to fight over financial issues. Kate lashes back that she would never depend on Charlie's parents' money and that she has struggled her whole life. Kate decides to tell Mrs. Barnes the truth and is fired. In a bar, she relapses. Jenny and Dave drive her home, where she starts an altercation with Charlie.\n\nAfter some time, Kate speaks at an AA meeting, celebrating one year of sobriety, while Charlie gets in trouble for riding a bicycle while drunk. Kate visits Charlie and they play croquet. Charlie asks if she would move back in with him if he begins going to AA meetings. Kate says he must get sober for himself, not for her. Charlie then asks Kate to play another round, to give him a chance to redeem himself. The film ends before Kate gives her answer.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] as Kate Hannah\n* [[Aaron Paul]] as Charlie Hannah\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Jenny\n* [[Nick Offerman]] as Dave Davies\n* [[Megan Mullally]] as Principal Patricia Barnes\n* [[Mary Kay Place]] as Rochelle\n* [[Kyle Gallner]] as Owen Hannah\n* [[Bree Turner]] as Freda\n* [[Mackenzie Davis]] as Millie\n* Richmond Arquette as Arlo\n* [[Natalie Dreyfuss]] as Amber\n* [[Brad Carter]] as Felix\n\n==Production==\n[[File:James Ponsoldt at Festival de deauville 2012.jpg|thumb|right|James Ponsoldt, who directed ''Smashed'' from a script he wrote with Susan Burke<ref name=\"latimes\" />]]\n''Smashed'' was conceived by [[James Ponsoldt]] and [[Susan Theresa Burke|Susan Burke]] after they had a conversation about things they had done while drunk.<ref name=ifq>{{cite web|url=http://independentfilmquarterly.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1052&Itemid=125|title=James Ponsoldt: Smashed|work=Independent Film Quarterly|first=Dan|last=Frank|access-date=September 29, 2015|archive-date=September 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930222526/http://independentfilmquarterly.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1052&Itemid=125|url-status=live}}</ref> Some of the story's details were based on Burke's own experience; she was an alcoholic until she was 24 years old, when she started attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.<ref name=ifq/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/bp/smashed-director-james-ponsoldt-talks-drunk-girl-john-200137350.html?nf=1|publisher=[[Yahoo]]|title='Smashed' director James Ponsoldt talks about 'the drunk girl,' John Cassavetes and 'Jersey Shore'|first=Jonathan|last=Crow|date=October 11, 2012|access-date=September 29, 2015|archive-date=October 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001162049/https://www.yahoo.com/movies/bp/smashed-director-james-ponsoldt-talks-drunk-girl-john-200137350.html?nf=1|url-status=live}}</ref> Burke felt that her experiences with alcoholism had not been represented on film before, and so she decided to write about a young woman deciding to become sober.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://screencrave.com/2012-10-09/interview-3/|publisher=ScreenCrave|title=Interview: James Ponsoldt And Susan Burke On Creating 'Smashed'|date=October 9, 2012|first=Laura|last=Frances|access-date=September 29, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001146/http://screencrave.com/2012-10-09/interview-3/|archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> Burke and Ponsoldt discussed the story, characters and tone in detail before they began to write the script.<ref name=filmmaker>{{cite news|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/53138-james-ponsoldt-smashed/#.VEY9LhZaZFo|title=James Ponsoldt, Smashed|date=October 10, 2012|first=Kevin|last=Canfield|access-date=September 29, 2015|work=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]]|archive-date=September 6, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906102739/http://filmmakermagazine.com/53138-james-ponsoldt-smashed/#.VEY9LhZaZFo|url-status=live}}</ref> Since they lived on opposite sides of the United States, they communicated by email,<ref name=casper>{{cite news|url=http://casperjournal.com/news/article_83a70d51-a08c-515c-bdae-0fc9926637a4.html|title=Casper native's movie is 'Smashed' \u2013 Susan Burke wins Sundance Festival grand jury award|work=Casper Journal|first=Makayla|last=Moore|date=December 19, 2012|access-date=September 29, 2015}}</ref> dividing the script into 15-page installments which they wrote alternately.<ref name=filmmaker/> The entire writing process took six months.<ref name=casper/>\n\nCasting negotiations for the film's main roles\u2014played by [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], [[Aaron Paul]], [[Octavia Spencer]] and [[Nick Offerman]]\u2014took place in September 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2011/film/news/winstead-paul-get-smashed-1118043140/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Winstead, Paul get 'Smashed'|first=Jeff|last=Sneider|date=September 20, 2011|access-date=September 29, 2015|archive-date=September 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930195040/http://variety.com/2011/film/news/winstead-paul-get-smashed-1118043140/|url-status=live}}</ref> To prepare for her role, Winstead talked with Burke about her recovery and attended a variety of AA meetings, where she spoke with other young women who had gotten sober.
