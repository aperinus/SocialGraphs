It stars [[Innokenty Smoktunovsky]], [[Oleg Yefremov]], [[Anatoli Papanov]], [[Andrei Mironov (actor)|Andrei Mironov]], and [[Georgiy Zhzhonov]], among others.\n''Beware of the Car'' is recognized as a satire of the [[film noir]] genre, highly unusual in [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]]-[[Era of Stagnation|-era society]]. It is credited for launching Soviet [[political satire]] as a film genre, typified by Ryazanov's work.\n\n== Plot ==\nYuri Detochkin (Smoktunovsky) is a humble Soviet [[Insurance broker|insurance agent]] who [[Motor vehicle theft|steals fancy cars]] from corrupt Soviet officials and scammers, disappointed by the [[militsiya]] being unable to fight the crooks. One of Detochkin's victims is Dima Semitsvetov (Mironov), a retail embezzler mocked but tolerated by his colorful father-in-law Semyon Vasilyevich (Papanov), a retired [[Soviet Army]] officer. Dima has a [[dacha]] (registered to his father-in-law) and a Volga car (registered in his wife's name). \nMeanwhile, Yuri is a commitmentphobe who has been courting his bus-driver girlfriend for years without settling down with her.\nIn his spare time, Yuri is an amateur actor, and in his latest play, a production of [[Hamlet]], he is playing alongside his friend, Detective Maksim Podberyozovikov (Yefremov).\nNot knowing who the car thief is, Detective Podberyozovikov investigates the missing cars. \nWhen he realises who is stealing them and why, the detective faces a serious moral problem, as he discovers that Detochkin has sold the cars and anonymously transferred the proceeds to the accounts of various [[orphanage]]s. \n==Cast==\n* [[Innokenty Smoktunovsky]] as Yuri Detochkin<ref name=\"sched\"/>\n* [[Oleg Yefremov]] as Maksim Podberyozovikov\n* [[Lyubov Dobrzhanskaya]] as Detochkin's mother\n* [[Olga Aroseva]] as Lyuba\n* [[Andrei Mironov (actor)|Andrei Mironov]] as Dima Semitsvetov\n* [[Anatoli Papanov]] as Semyon Vasilyevich\n* Tatyana Gavrilova as Inna\n* [[Georgiy Zhzhonov]] as a Militsiya officer\n* [[Yevgeny Yevstigneyev]] as an acting coach\n* [[Donatas Banionis]] as a priest\n* [[Lyubov Sokolova (actress)|Lyubov Sokolova]] as a judge\n* [[Vyacheslav Nevinny]] as a car mechanic\n* [[Gotlib Roninson]] as Yakov Mikhailovich\n* [[Galina Volchek]] as a customer\n* Sergey Kulagin as Philippe Cartuzov\n* Yakov Lents as a tobacconist salesman\n* Nikolay Parfyonov as a prosecutor\n* Victoria Radunskaya as Tanya\n* Boris Runge as a man with suitcases\nThe author's narration was read by [[Yury Yakovlev]].\n\n== Production ==\nThe film's name is derived from [[traffic sign]]s warning of locations where cars could potentially hit pedestrians or motorists, such as [[Multistorey car park|parking garages]].[[File:Beware of the Car sign.jpg|thumb|Signs reading \"Beware of the Car\", warning of locations where cars could potentially hit pedestrians or motorists. These signs were common in Soviet cities.]]\nIn the film, Detochkin and Podberezovikov act together in an amateur theatre which rehearses ''[[Hamlet]]'' \u2013 a play from Smoktunovsky's real-life acting career: he was reputed as the \"best Hamlet on the Soviet stage\" and starred in a celebrated [[Hamlet (1964 film)|film adaptation]].<ref name=\"sched\"/>\n\nThe waltz<ref name=\"waltz\">[http://music70-80.narod.ru/mp/Muz/Beregis_avtomobily.mp3 Waltz - instrumental - MP3 - 3,7 MB - 128 Kbps] at [http://music70-80.narod.ru/muz-1.htm Cinema music (1938 - 1985)] website {{in lang|ru}}</ref> performed in the film is a distinguished melody composed by [[Andrey Petrov]]. [[Sergey Nikitin (musician)|Sergey Nikitin]]'s repertoire includes a song named ''Classy Gentleman'' (lyrics by [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]]), which used a waltz from the film.\n\nAll of the cars stolen by Detochkin are the [[GAZ-21|GAZ-21 Volga]] model, the most prestigious Soviet car of the time. The GAZ-21 was the standard personal car for the Soviet elite, a satire element of the film which Ryazanov found very hard to get approved.\n\nOne scene featuring a [[Filling station|petrol station]] includes American vehicles such as a 1955 [[Buick]] and a 1955 [[Oldsmobile]]. These were an extremely rare sighting for the location, since the United States had sanctions on the USSR and did not sell these cars within the [[Eastern Bloc]].\n\n==Awards==\n\nThe film was the [[List of Soviet films of the year by ticket sales|leader of Soviet film distribution]] for 1966, viewed by 29 million people.<ref>[https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/46089/dates/ \t\u0411\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044f] on [[KinoPoisk]]</ref> Innokenty Smoktunovsky was recognized as the Best Actor of 1966.\n\nThe film won awards at the 1966 [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]], 1966 [[Sydney Film Festival]], 1967 [[Melbourne International Film Festival]], and 1969 [[Cartagena Film Festival]].\n\n==Fact==\nInitially, [[Victor Salva]]'s debut horror film was supposed to have the same name, however, when he was told that such a film already existed, he changed the name to [[Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)|Jeepers Creepers]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Gone in 60 Seconds (1974 film)|''Gone in 60 Seconds'' (1974 film)]], an American film that also focuses on an insurance agent who is secretly a car thief\n*[[Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)|''Gone in 60 Seconds'' (2000 film)]], a loose remake of the 1974 film with different characters, including a detective who pursues the main character, whom he knows personally\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n*{{YouTube|id=jZ33mMmfvaM|title=Beware of the car}}\n*{{IMDb title|0060161}}\n*{{Amg movie|115001}}\n\n{{Eldar Ryazanov}}\n\n[[Category:1966 films]]\n[[Category:1966 in the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:1960s crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Mosfilm films]]\n[[Category:1960s Russian-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about automobiles]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Eldar Ryazanov]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Moscow]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Andrey Petrov]]\n[[Category:Soviet crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Russian crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Russian vigilante films]]\n[[Category:1966 comedy films]]"}]}}}}
