It stars [[Nigel Terry]] as Arthur, [[Nicol Williamson]] as [[Merlin]], [[Nicholas Clay]] as [[Lancelot]], [[Cherie Lunghi]] as [[Guinevere|Guenevere]], [[Helen Mirren]] as [[Morgana le Fay|Morgana]], [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Gawain]], [[Gabriel Byrne]] as [[Uther Pendragon]], [[Corin Redgrave]] as [[Gorlois| Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall]], and [[Patrick Stewart]] as [[Leodegrance|Leondegrance]].

Merlin agrees to help Uther seduce her in exchange for \u201cwhat issues from your lust\". With Merlin's magic, Uther tricks Igrayne into sleeping with him while Cornwall dies in battle. His daughter [[Morgan le Fay|Morgana]], however, sees through Uther's illusion. Nine months later, Igrayne gives birth to [[King Arthur|Arthur]], and Merlin comes for the boy. Furious, Uther chases after Merlin, but gets ambushed by Cornwall's surviving men. Before dying, Uther thrusts Excalibur into a large stone. Merlin declares that he who pulls the sword from the stone shall be king.\n\nYears later, Arthur pulls Excalibur from the stone, proving he is Uther's son, the rightful ruler. Arthur's bravery and prowess at combat make him earn the trust of knights Leodegrance and Uryens, who swear fealty to the young king. During this time, Arthur also meets [[Guinevere]] and is smitten by her.\n\nLater, the undefeated knight [[Lancelot]] blocks a bridge, seeking a king worthy of his sword. He defeats the king's knights and gets challenged by Arthur to a fight. With the aid of Excalibur and the Lady of the Lake, Arthur is victorious, and Lancelot swears allegiance to him. Arthur and his knights unify the land. Arthur creates the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]], commissions the building of his castle [[Camelot]] and marries Guinevere. Meanwhile, his half-sister Morgana becomes apprenticed to Merlin.\n\nInfluenced by Morgana's magic, Gawain accuses Guinevere of treachery and a duel over her innocence is set. While Arthur is judge of the trial, Lancelot fights for her honor and wins. Guinevere is moved by this and the two make love. Arthur finds out about it and spitefully thrusts Excalibur into the ground between them. Merlin's magical link to the land impales him on the sword, and Morgana seizes the opportunity to trap him and steal his secret Charm of Making. Taking the form of Guinevere, she seduces the unknowing Arthur.\n\nShe later births a son, [[Mordred]], whose [[incest]]uous origin strikes the land with famine and sickness. Struck by a magical bolt of lightning, Arthur is reduced to a weakened state. He sends his knights on a quest for the [[Holy Grail]] in hopes of restoring the land and himself. While searching, many of them die or are bewitched by Morgana into entering her service. After reaching adulthood, Mordred demands for Arthur's crown, to no avail. Before coldly rebuking Arthur's attempt to recognize him as his son, Mordred vows to return with an army and take Camelot by force.\n\n[[Percival|Perceval]] resists Morgana's attacks and, before long, he is the final remaining knight questing for the Grail. Along the way, he nearly drowns and is transported to where the Grail is kept. He proves worthy, gains the Grail and takes it back to Arthur, who drinks from it and is revitalized, along with the land. Arthur calls upon his step-brother Kay to rally his remaining forces to battle Mordred and Morgana.\n\nArthur finds Guinevere at a convent, and they reconcile. She gives him back Excalibur, which she had kept, and he rides off with his men. At Stonehenge, Arthur falls asleep, and his love liberates Merlin from Morgana's magical prison. After a final conversation with Arthur, Merlin appears to Morgana and tricks her into speaking the Charm of Making. This exhausts her magical powers and summons a mist that envelops her camp and the battlefield. Mordred discovers her aged, true self and murders her in disgust.\n\nArthur and his men wage war on Mordred's forces, using the mist in their favour. During the battle, Lancelot arrives, reconciles with Arthur and dies fighting. Arthur manages to kill Mordred, but the fight leaves him mortally wounded. While slowly dying, he commands Perceval, the only other survivor, to throw Excalibur into a lake, knowing that one day the sword will rise again when a worthy king comes to power. Perceval complies, and the Lady of the Lake catches the sword, dragging it into the depths. Perceval returns to the battlefield in time to glimpse Arthur being carried away on a ship, sailing towards his rest on [[Avalon]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Nigel Terry]] as [[King Arthur]]\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as [[Morgan le Fay|Morgana Le Fay]]\n** Kay McLaren as the aged Morgana\n** Barbara Byrne as the young Morgana\n* [[Nicholas Clay]] as Sir [[Lancelot]]\n* [[Cherie Lunghi]] as Queen [[Guinevere|Guenevere]]\n* Paul Geoffrey as Sir [[Percival|Perceval]]\n* [[Nicol Williamson]] as [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]]<ref name=\"canbyquote\"/>\n* [[Corin Redgrave]] as [[Gorlois|Duke of Cornwall]]\n* [[Patrick Stewart]] as [[King Leodegrance]]\n* [[Keith Buckley (actor)|Keith Buckley]] as Sir [[Urien|Uryens]]\n* [[Clive Swift]] as [[Sir Ector]]\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Sir Gawain]]\n* [[Gabriel Byrne]] as [[King Uther Pendragon]]\n* [[Robert Addie]] as Prince [[Mordred]] (as an adult)\n** [[Charley Boorman]] as young Mordred\n* [[Katrine Boorman]] as [[Igraine|Igrayne]], Duchess of Cornwall\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as [[King Lot]]\n* [[Niall O'Brien (actor)|Niall O'Brien]] as [[Sir Kay]]\n{{div col end}}\n\nEven though he was 35 years old, [[Nigel Terry]] plays King Arthur from his teenage years to his ending as an aged monarch.\n\nSeveral members of the Boorman family also appear: his daughter Katrine Boorman played Igraine, Arthur's mother, and his son Charley Boorman portrayed Mordred as a boy.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' instead. Boorman was allowed to shop the script elsewhere, but no studio would commit to it. Returning to his original idea of the Merlin legend, Boorman was eventually able to secure deals that would help him do ''Excalibur''.

Boorman verified this on the ''Excalibur'' DVD commentary, saying he felt that the tension on the set would come through in the actors' performances. Boorman also cast his daughter [[Katrine Boorman]] as Igraine, Arthur's mother.\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Cahir Castle in Excalibur.png|thumb|left|[[Cahir Castle]] during the siege battle sequence]]\n[[File:Exaliburdrive.JPG|thumb|'' Excalibur'' locations trail in County Wicklow, 28 years after filming]]\n\n''Excalibur'' was filmed in Irish locations in [[County Wicklow]], [[County Tipperary]], and [[County Kerry]]. The early critical battle scene around a castle, in which Arthur is made a knight by Uryens while kneeling in a moat, was filmed in [[Cahir Castle]], in Cahir [[County Tipperary]], the Republic of Ireland, a well-preserved [[Architecture of Ireland#Medieval Ireland|Irish castle]]. The castle's moat is the River [[Suir]] which flows around it. The fight with Lancelot was filmed at [[Powerscourt Estate]]'s waterfall. Other locations included [[Wicklow Head]] as the backdrop to the battle over Tintagel, the Kerry coast as the place from which Arthur sails to Avalon, and a place called Childers Wood near [[Roundwood]], County Wicklow, where Arthur comes on Excalibur in the stone.  At the time, John Boorman was living just a few miles down the road, at Annamoe.<ref name=Cinema1>{{cite book| editor-last=Manthey| editor-first=Dirk| title=Excalibur| newspaper=Cinema Programme 27| pages=15, 20| year=1981}}</ref> According to Boorman, the love scene between Lancelot and Guenevere in the forest was filmed on a very cold night, but [[Nicholas Clay]] and [[Cherie Lunghi]] performed the scene nude anyway.\n\n===Costumes===\n[[File: Autographed Excalibur Armor.JPG|thumb|upright|Autographed armor from the movie Excalibur in a pub in Cahir, Ireland, 2004]]\n\n[[Bob Ringwood]] designed the costumes and received a [[BAFTA]] nomination for his work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1982/film/costume-design |title=Film Costume Design in 1982 | access-date=21 December 2016 |publisher=[[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]]}}</ref> [[Terry English]] designed the armor and went on to craft the armor for the film ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''.\n\n==Adaptation==\n[[Rospo Pallenberg]] and [[John Boorman]] wrote the screenplay, which is primarily an adaptation of [[Thomas Malory|Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur|Morte d'Arthur]]'' (1469\u201370) recasting the Arthurian legends as an allegory of the cycle of birth, life, decay, and restoration, by stripping the text of decorative or insignificant details. The resulting film is reminiscent of [[mythography|mythographic]] works such as Sir [[James Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' and [[Jessie Weston (scholar)|Jessie Weston]]'s ''[[From Ritual to Romance]]''; Arthur is presented as the \"Wounded King\" whose realm becomes a wasteland to be reborn thanks to the Grail, and may be compared to the [[Fisher King|Fisher (or Sinner) King]], whose land also became a wasteland, and was also healed by Perceval. \"The film has to do with ''mythical'' truth, not historical truth,\" Boorman remarked to a journalist during filming. The Christian symbolism revolves around the Grail, perhaps most strongly in the baptismal imagery of Perceval finally achieving the Grail quest.  \"That's what my story is about: the coming of Christian man and the disappearance of the old religions which are represented by Merlin. The forces of superstition and magic are swallowed up into the unconscious.\"<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite journal| url=http://americancinemapapers.homestead.com/files/EXCALIBUR.htm| title=John Boorman in Interview| journal=[[American Film (magazine)|American Film]]| date=March 1981| last=Kennedy| first=Harlan| access-date=2014-07-17}}</ref><ref name=dandalf>{{cite web |url=http://dandalf.com/dandalf/hollywoodgrail.html |title=The Quest for the Hollywood Grail John Boorman's Excalibur, and the Mythic Development of the Arthurian Legend ''(sic)'' |access-date=8 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625172606/http://www.dandalf.com/dandalf/hollywoodgrail.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=25 June 2006}}</ref>\n[[File: London Film Museum (5094934492).jpg|thumb|upright|The film's sword Excalibur at the [[London Film Museum]]]]\n\nIn addition to Malory, the writers incorporated elements from other Arthurian stories, sometimes altering them. For example, the sword between the sleeping lovers' bodies comes from the tales of [[Tristan and Iseult]]; the knight who returns Excalibur to the water is changed from [[Bedivere]] to Perceval; and [[Morgause]] and [[Morgan Le Fay]] are merged into one character. The sword Excalibur and the [[Excalibur#Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone|Sword in the Stone]] are presented as the same thing; in some versions of the legends, they are separate. In ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', Sir Galahad, the illegitimate son of Lancelot and Elaine of Carbone, is the Knight who is worthy of the Holy Grail. Boorman follows the earlier version of the tale as told by [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]], making Perceval the grail winner. Some new elements were added, such as Uther wielding Excalibur before Arthur (repeated in ''[[Merlin (miniseries)|Merlin]]''), Merlin's 'Charm of Making' (written in [[Old Irish]]), and the concept of the world as \"the dragon\" (probably inspired by the dragon omen seen in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s account of Merlin's life).<ref>Geoffrey of Monmouth: [[Historia Regum Britanniae|History of the Kings of Britain]], VII, 3.</ref>\n\n===The Charm of Making===\nAccording to [[Linguistics|linguist]] [[Michael Everson]], the \"Charm of Making\" that Merlin speaks to invoke the dragon is an invention, there being no attested source for the charm.
