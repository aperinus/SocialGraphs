The next scene depicts the [[Saturn V]] rocket during its [[Apollo 11]] launch. It then fades to a desolate desert landscape, before progressing to various natural phenomena.\n\nThe film then incorporates humanity in the environment, with shots of choppy water, cultivated flowers, the artificial [[Lake Powell]], a large mining truck causing billows of dust, [[electric power transmission|power lines]], mining operations, oil fields, the [[Navajo Generating Station]], the [[Glen Canyon Dam]], and [[atomic bomb]] detonations in a desert. A shot sees sunbathers on a beach, with the [[San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station]] in the background, before moving on to an aircraft, cars, and military vehicles. [[Time-lapse photography|Time-lapses]] of cloud shadows move across skyscrapers, and various housing projects are in disrepair. Destruction of large buildings were depicted, including the demolition of the [[Pruitt-Igoe|Pruitt-Igoe housing project]] in [[St. Louis]]. A time-lapse of a crowd queueing is followed by shots of people walking along streets in [[slow motion]].\n\nThe next sequence features a sunset reflected in the glass of a skyscraper, before depicting people interacting with modern technology. It sees visceral depictions of traffic, followed by people hurrying to work, and the operation of machines packaging food. Many labors are aided with the use of technology. The sequence begins to come full circle as the manufacture of cars in an assembly-line factory is shown. Daylight highway traffic are shown, followed by the movement of cars, [[shopping cart]]s, televisions in an assembly line, and elevators. Time-lapses of various television shows being [[channel surfing|channel surfed]] are shown. In slow motion, several people react to being candidly filmed; the camera stays on them until the moment they [[Fourth wall|look directly at it]]. Cars then move speedier.\n\nShots of [[microchip]]s and [[satellite photography]] of cities are shown, comparing the lay of each of them. Night shots of buildings are shown, as well as of people from all walks of life, from beggars to debutantes. A rocket is seen lifting off to sudden explosion; the camera follows the flaming engine and a white smoky trail as the debris falls. The film concludes with another image of the Great Gallery pictograph, this time with smaller figures. It ends with the definition of the titular [[Hopi language|Hopi]] noun (\"crazy life; life in turmoil; life out of balance; life disintegrating; a state of life that calls for another way of living\") as well as the translation lyrics that was sung in \"Prophecies\", one of the musical tracks in the film.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Background===\nIn 1972, [[Godfrey Reggio]], of the Institute for Regional Education (IRE), was working on a media campaign in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which was sponsored by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU). The campaign involved invasions of privacy and the use of technology to control behavior. Instead of making public service announcements, which Reggio felt \"had no visibility\", advertising spots were purchased for television, radio, newspapers, and billboards.{{sfn|MacDonald|1992|p=383}} Over thirty billboards were used for the campaign, and one design featured a close-up of the human eye, which Reggio described as a \"horrifying image\",{{sfn|MacDonald|1992|p=384}} To produce the television commercials the IRE hired cinematographer [[Ron Fricke]], who worked on the project for two years. The television advertisements aired during prime-time programming and became so popular that viewers would call the television stations to learn when the next advertisement would be aired.{{sfn|MacDonald|1992|p=383}} Godfrey described the two-year campaign as \"extraordinarily successful\", and as a result, [[Methylphenidate|Ritalin (methylphenidate)]] was eliminated as a behavior-modifying drug in many New Mexico school districts.{{sfn|MacDonald|1992|p=384}} But after the campaign ended, the ACLU eventually withdrew its sponsorship, and the IRE unsuccessfully attempted to raise millions of dollars at a fundraiser in Washington, D.C. The institute only had $40,000 left in its budget, and Reggio was unsure how to use the small amount of funds. Fricke insisted to Reggio that the money could be used to produce a film, which led to the production of ''Koyaanisqatsi''.{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=63}}\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Pruitt-Igoe-collapses.jpg|thumb|The demolition of the [[Pruitt\u2013Igoe]] housing project in St. Louis, Missouri, was one of the early scenes filmed once production began in 1975.]]\nReggio and Fricke chose to shoot unscripted footage and edit it into an hour-long film.{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=63}} Production began in 1975 in St. Louis, Missouri.{{sfn|MacDonald|1992|p=385}} [[16 mm film]] was used due to budget constraints, despite the preference to shoot with [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1992|p=385}}{{sfn|MacDonald|1992|p=386}} Footage of the [[Pruitt\u2013Igoe]] housing project was shot from a helicopter, and Fricke nearly passed out during filming, having never flown in a helicopter before.{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=63}} Reggio later chose to shoot in [[Los Angeles]] and New York City. As there was no formal script, Fricke shot whatever he felt would \"look good on film\".{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=64}} While filming in New York City, Fricke developed an idea to shoot portraits of people. A grey paper backdrop was displayed in Times Square, and Fricke stood {{convert|10|ft|m|sigfig=1}} back with the camera. People walking by started posing for the camera, thinking it was a [[still camera]], and several shots from the setup ended up in the film. Reggio was not on location in Times Square when Fricke shot the footage and thought the idea of shooting portraits of people was \"foolish\". Upon viewing the footage, Reggio decided to devote an entire section of the film to portraits. The footage was processed with a special chemical to enhance the film's shadows and details, as all footage was shot only with existing lighting. The IRE's $40,000 was exhausted after the filming, and almost two cases of film had been used. The unedited footage was screened in Santa Fe, New Mexico, but Fricke said it was \"boring as hell\" and there were \"not that many good shots\".{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=64}} Fricke later moved to Los Angeles, and took a job as a waiter, unable to get a job in the film industry. While Fricke was working in Los Angeles, he edited the footage into a 20-minute reel, but \"without regard for message or political content\".{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=64}}\n\n{{quote box|quote=I just shot anything that I thought would look good on film. Shooting bums, as well as buildings, didn't matter. It was all the same from my standpoint. I just shot the form of things.|source=\u2014Ron Fricke{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=64}}|width=250px}}\n\nThe IRE was continuously receiving funding and wanted to continue the project in 1976, using 35&nbsp;mm film.{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=64}} After quitting his waiting job, Fricke traveled with a camera crew to the [[Four Corners]], which was chosen for filming for its \"alien look\".{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=66}} Due to the limited budget, Fricke shot with a 16&nbsp;mm [[zoom lens]] onto 35&nbsp;mm film. To compensate for the lens size, a 2\u00d7 extender was added, which turned it into a full 35&nbsp;mm zoom lens, allowing footage to be clearly captured onto 35&nbsp;mm film. The two-week shoot included [[aerial shot|aerial footage]] taken from an airplane using a [[hand-held camera]] and ground footage taken using a tripod. The first aerial footage was too \"shaky\", so additional footage was taken from a camera mounted onto the airplane. Fricke traveled back to New York City in 1977, during which the [[New York City blackout of 1977|New York City blackout]] occurred. Footage of the blackout was filmed in Harlem and the South Bronx, and the film was [[colorfulness|desaturated]] to match the appearance of the 16&nbsp;mm footage.{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=66}}\n[[File:Time Lapse video of a 3 hour period in Silom Bangkok Thailand by Don Ramey Logan.webm|thumb|Example of \"time-lapse\" video, which ''Koyaanisqatsi'' uses heavily]]\nReggio and Fricke came across time-lapse footage in \"some low-visibility commercial work\". They felt such footage was \"the language [they] were missing\", and collectively decided to implement time-lapse as a major part of the film to create \"an experience of acceleration\". For the time-lapse footage, Fricke purchased a [[Mitchell Camera|Mitchell]] camera,{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=66}} and built a motor with an [[intervalometer]], which was used to precisely move the camera between frames. The system was powered by a [[VRLA battery|gel cell battery]] that lasted for twelve hours, which enabled Fricke to shoot without the use of a [[electric generator|generator]].{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=68}} Most time-lapse shots were filmed at a [[frame rate]] of 1\u00bd frames per second. Fricke wanted the footage to \"look normal\" and not contain any \"gimmicky\" special effects.{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=68}} The time-lapse shot overlooking the freeway in Los Angeles was filmed from the top of a building through a [[multiple exposure|double exposure]], with ten-second delay between frames. The first take was shot throughout the day for twelve hours, then the film was rewound and the same scene was shot at night for twenty minutes.{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=68}}\nThe scene with the Boeing 747 on the runway was filmed at Los Angeles International Airport, and was the longest continuous shot in the film. Fricke and his [[focus puller]], Robert Hill, filmed at the airport every day for two weeks.{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=70}} To keep the shot of the 747 within the frame, the camera was slowly moved by increasing the voltage to the gear motors.{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=68}}\n\nIn addition to footage shot by Fricke, some of the footage of people and traffic in New York City was shot by cinematographer [[Hilary Harris]]. During post-production, Reggio was introduced to Harris' ''Organism'' (1975), which predominately features time-lapse footage of New York City streets. Reggio was impressed with Harris' work and subsequently hired him to work on ''Koyaanisqatsi''.{{sfn|MacDonald|1992|p=387}} Footage filmed by cinematographer [[Louis Schwartzberg]] was added into the cloud sequence, and additional stock footage was provided by [[MacGillivray Freeman Films]].{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=72}}\n\nWhile Reggio was working on post-production at the [[Samuel Goldwyn Studio]] in 1981,<ref name=\"lonegiant\">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/interview_lone_giant_godfrey_reggios_naqoyqatsi/|title=INTERVIEW: Lone Giant: Godfrey Reggio's 'Naqoyqatsi{{'-}}|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=October 18, 2002|access-date=April 26, 2011|first=Erin|last=Torneo}}</ref> he met film director [[Francis Ford Coppola]] through an associate from [[Zoetrope Studios]], Coppola's production company. Before shooting ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]'' (1983) and ''[[Rumble Fish]]'' (1983), Coppola requested to see ''Koyaanisqatsi'', and Reggio arranged a private screening shortly after its completion.{{sfn|MacDonald|1992|p=399}} Coppola told Reggio that he was waiting for a film such as ''Koyaanisqatsi'' and that it was \"important for people to see\", so he added his name into the credits and helped present and distribute the film.{{sfn|Ramsey|1986|p=62}} Coppola also decided to introduce and end the film with footage of [[pictogram|pictographs]] from the Great Gallery at [[Horseshoe Canyon (Utah)|Horseshoe Canyon]] in Utah after visiting the site and becoming fascinated by the ancient sandstone murals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-08-10/news/vw-2386_1_horseshoe-canyon|title=The Past Comes to Life in Horseshoe Canyon|first=Charles|last=Hillinger|date=August 10, 1986|access-date=April 26, 2011|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Koyaanisqatsi\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| longtype   = composed\n| artist     = [[Philip Glass]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1983\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]], [[film score]], [[Contemporary classical music|contemporary classical]], [[Minimalist music|minimalism]]\n| length     = 46:25\n| label      = [[Island Records|Antilles/Island]]\n| producer   = Kurt Munkacsi & [[Philip Glass]]\n| prev_title = [[Glassworks (Glass)|Glassworks]]\n| prev_year  = 1982\n| next_title = [[The Photographer]]\n| next_year  = 1983\n}}\nThe film's score was composed by [[Philip Glass]] and was performed by the [[Philip Glass Ensemble]], conducted by Michael Riesman.\n\nAn abbreviated version of the film's soundtrack was released in 1983 by [[Island Records]]. Despite the fact that the amount of music in the film was nearly as long as the film itself, this 1983 soundtrack release was only 46 minutes long, and only featured some of the film's pieces.\n\nIn 1998, Philip Glass re-recorded the film score with [[Nonesuch Records]] with a length of 73 minutes. This new recording includes new additional tracks that were cut from the film, as well as extended versions of tracks from the original album. This album was released as ''Koyaanisqatsi'', rather than a soundtrack to the film.\n\nIn 2009, a remastered album was released under Philip Glass' own music label, Orange Mountain Music, as ''Koyaanisqatsi: Complete Original Soundtrack''. This recording, with a length over 76 minutes, includes the original sound-effects and additional music that was used in the film.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Complete Original Soundtrack (Orange Mountain Music) OMM 0058 |url=http://www.philipglass.com/music/recordings/Koyaanisqatsi-09.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608193034/http://www.philipglass.com/music/recordings/Koyaanisqatsi-09.php |archive-date=June 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe opening for \"The Grid\" begins with slow sustained notes on brass instruments. The music builds in speed and [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] throughout the piece's 21 minutes. When the piece is at its fastest, it is characterized by a [[synthesizer]] playing the piece's bass line [[ostinato]].\n\nGlass's music for the film is a highly recognizable example of the [[minimal music|minimalist]] school of composition, which is characterized by heavily repeated figures, simple structures, and a tonal (although not in the traditional [[common practice]] sense of the word) harmonic language.
