In 1990, Coppola turned her material over to two young filmmakers, [[George Hickenlooper]] and Fax Bahr (co-creator of ''[[MADtv]]''), who subsequently shot new interviews with the original cast and crew, and intercut them with Eleanor Coppola's material. After a year of editing, Hickenlooper, Bahr, and Coppola debuted their film at the [[1991 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/112/year/1991.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse |access-date=2009-08-10|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> to universal critical acclaim. {{Citation needed|reason=Unlikely universal, needs supporting cites in any case|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe title is derived from the [[Joseph Conrad]] 1899 novella ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', the source material for ''Apocalypse Now''.\n\n==Awards==\nOriginally aired on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime Network]] in the [[United States]], ''Hearts of Darkness'' won several awards, among them the [[National Board of Review]] award for Best Documentary, 1991; an [[American Cinema Editors]] society award for Best Edited Documentary (1992); two [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] awards for \"Outstanding Individual Achievement \u2013 Informational Programming \u2013 Directing\" and \"Outstanding Individual Achievement \u2013 Informational Programming \u2013 Picture Editing\" (1992), and the [[International Documentary Association]] award (1992).  Critic Gene Siskel listed it as the best movie of 1991.\n\n==Home media==\n''Hearts of Darkness'' was released by [[Paramount Home Media Distribution|Paramount Home Video]] on [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] in 1992, with further re-releases occurring in 1994 and 1998.
