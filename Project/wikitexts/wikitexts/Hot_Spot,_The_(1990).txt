(1992). ''Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style'' (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: [[The Overlook Press]]. {{ISBN|0-87951-479-5}}</ref> directed by [[Dennis Hopper]], based on the 1953 novel ''Hell Hath No Fury'' by [[Charles Williams (American author)|Charles Williams]], who also co-wrote the screenplay. It stars [[Don Johnson]], [[Virginia Madsen]], and [[Jennifer Connelly]], and features a score by [[Jack Nitzsche]] played by [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], [[Roy Rogers (guitarist)|Roy Rogers]], [[Tim Drummond]], and drummer [[Earl Palmer]].\n\n==Plot==\nDrifter Harry Madox takes a job as a used car salesman in a small [[Texas]] town. In the summer heat, he develops an interest in Gloria Harper, who works at the car dealership.  Dolly Harshaw, who is married to the dealership's owner, flirts with Harry and they begin a torrid affair.\n\nHarry learns that the bank staff are all volunteer firemen so he sets a fire to lure them away from the bank. While they are gone, Harry robs the bank, and then enters the burning building to save a man trapped inside. Despite this the town's sheriff suspects Harry of committing the robbery, but Dolly gives him an alibi and tells him she will sell him out unless he kills her husband. When he refuses, Dolly threatens to expose him. She ultimately kills her husband herself by overstimulating his weak heart during sex.\n\nMeanwhile, Gloria is being blackmailed by Frank Sutton, who has nude photographs of Irene Davey and Gloria, after hearing about Irene being with another woman, her former teacher. Harry, who has fallen in love with Gloria, confronts Sutton to get the pictures. They have a fight but Sutton continues to blackmail Gloria. Harry visits Sutton and finds him with a woman, and kills Sutton in the ensuing struggle. Harry plants evidence to divert suspicion away from himself, then tells the police that Sutton, who had no job and few assets, had recently paid cash for a new car, making it seem that Sutton had robbed the bank. Harry receives a hefty reward for providing the tip that helps the police \"solve\" the robbery. He plans to marry Gloria and take her to the [[Caribbean Islands]].\n\nDolly ruins Harry's plans by showing him a copy of a letter (to be opened in the event of her death) implicating him in the robbery and in Sutton's death, and telling Gloria about the affair. A heartbroken Gloria leaves Harry. Enraged, Harry tries to strangle Dolly, but cannot bring himself to kill her. Harry resigns himself to life with Dolly, and leaves town with her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Don Johnson]] as Harry Madox\n* [[Virginia Madsen]] as Dolly Harshaw\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Gloria Harper<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cedrone |first1=Lou |title='Hot Spot' tries to replace plot with nudity |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1990-10-30-1990303149-story.html |website=Baltimore Sun |access-date=4 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201004101556/https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3AFE_vfh08UmkJ%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.baltimoresun.com%2Fnews%2Fbs-xpm-1990-10-30-1990303149-story.html |archive-date=4 October 2020 |date=1990-10-30 |quote= The new film, a blend of \"[[The Long Hot Summer]]\" and \"[[Double Indemnity]],\" is terminally dull, a 130-minute long movie that should run no longer than 90 minutes.}}</ref>\n* Debra Cole as Irene Davey<ref>{{cite web |title=The Hot Spot (1990) |url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/Spot+1990/6199796/story.html |website=[[Edmonton Journal]] |access-date=4 October 2020 |language=en-ca |date=2012-02-23 |quote=...Debra Cole are the only memorable things about this less-than-stellar Hollywood flick, which was directed by Dennis Hopper}}</ref>\n* [[Jerry Hardin]] as George Harshaw\n* [[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]] as Frank Sutton\n* [[Charles Martin Smith]] as Lon Gulick\n* [[Barry Corbin]] as the Sheriff\n* [[Leon Rippy]] as Deputy Tate\n* [[Jack Nance]] as Julian Ward\n* [[Virgil Frye]] as Deputy Buck\n}}\n\n==Production==\nCharles Williams wrote a screenplay version of his own novel with Nona Tyson in 1962.<ref name=\"Thomas\">{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=Bob |title=Director Hopper's back in hot spot with new film |work=The Advertiser |date=November 22, 1990}}</ref> It was intended for [[Robert Mitchum]].

He has a lot of people with him. He came on to this film with two bodyguards, a cook, a trainer, ah let's see, a helicopter pilot he comes to and from the set in a helicopter, very glamorous let's see, two drivers, a secretary, and, oh yes, his own hair person, his own make-up person, his own wardrobe person.

Three days before we started shooting, Dennis Hopper came to all of us, he called a meeting on a Sunday, and he said, \"Okay, we're not making that script. We're making this one.\" And he passed a script around the table that had been written for Robert Mitchum in the '60s... or maybe it was the '50s... and it was based on a book called ''Hell Hath No Fury''. And that was the movie that we ended up making. This was three days before we started shooting! So he was kind of looking around the table at everybody and saying, \"Well, you know, if Don Johnson bails, we don't have a movie.\" [Laughs.] And I read the script, and I said, \"Wow!\" I mean, the Figgis script was really slick and cool, and it was a heist movie, but this was real noir, the guy was an amoral drifter, and it was all about how women were going to take him down.<ref>[http://www.avclub.com/article/don-johnson-cold-july-dennis-hopper-and-auditionin-205139 \"Don Johnson on Cold In July, Dennis Hopper, and auditioning for ''Miami Vice''\"], Will Harris, ''[[The A.V.
