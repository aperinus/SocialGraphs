It was directed by [[John Huston]] with a screenplay by Huston and [[Ray Bradbury]]. The film starred [[Gregory Peck]], [[Richard Basehart]], and [[Leo Genn]].\n\nThe music score was written by [[Philip Sainton]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1841, a sailor named [[Ishmael (Moby-Dick)|Ishmael]] wanders to the [[New England]] town of [[New Bedford]], [[Massachusetts]] to sign on a [[Whaler|whaling ship]]. In the inn where he is staying for the night, he is forced to share his room with a Pacific Islander and [[Boatsteerer|harponeer]] named [[Queequeg]], whom he befriends after a tense first meeting. The next morning, the two of them hire onto a whaling ship named ''[[Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod]]'', which is commanded by grim [[Captain Ahab]], who is obsessed with hunting and killing a legendary white-skinned whale named [[Moby Dick (whale)|Moby Dick]], who was responsible for severing Ahab's left leg. Just before their departure, Ishmael and Queequeg encounter a man named [[List of Moby-Dick characters#Elijah|Elijah]], who delivers an ominous warning about Ahab and that all but one of the crew who follow him will find their deaths on this voyage.\n\nAs the ship casts off, and for some time afterwards, Ahab remains unseen until he finally appears to align his crew to the hunt for Moby Dick and sets course for the [[Bikini Atoll]], where the whale is said to dwell. While the crew reaps a fair bounty of [[Whale oil|oil]] on their journey, Ahab's obsession with Moby Dick remains foremost in his mind. When the captain of a passing ship, who recently lost his hand to the white whale, informs Ahab of Moby Dick's latest whereabouts near the coast of [[Madagascar]], Ahab immediately breaks off a particularly successful hunt, unsettling his crew, particularly his [[chief mate]] [[List of Moby-Dick characters#Mates|Starbuck]]. Starbuck suggests to his fellow officers [[List of Moby-Dick characters#Mates|Stubb]] and [[List of Moby-Dick characters#Mates|Flask]] to [[Mutiny|wrest command of the ''Pequod'']] from Ahab, which the two refuse.\n\nAs the ''Pequod'' nears the atoll, a man falls from the ship's mast into the sea and disappears. Right afterwards, the ''Pequod ''is stuck in [[slack water]] for days. [[Divination|Casting bones to read his future]], Queequeg foresees his death and orders the ship's carpenter to make him a coffin, before he sits down to await his demise. When one of the crew prepares to cut Queequeg's skin for fun, Ishmael rises to his friend's defense, prompting Queequeg to break his [[Daydream|death reverie]] and defend Ishmael. Just then, Moby Dick briefly appears before the ship and escapes before the ''Pequod'' crew can attack him.\n\nAfter rowing the ship out of the becalmed area, Ahab resumes the hunt. They encounter the ''Rachel'', another whaler from [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]], whose captain, Gardiner, asks Ahab to help search for his son, who was carried off by Moby Dick. Ahab refuses his aid and departs. When the ''Pequod'' hits a [[typhoon]], Ahab uses the gale to speed the chase, endangering the ship. Starbuck decides to depose Ahab by force, but relents when in a rare humane moment Ahab reminisces about his self-destructive obsession for revenge.\n\nRight after this conversation, a strange omen portends the fulfillment of Elijah's baleful prophecy, which Ishmael recounts to Ahab. The captain seems affected, but shakes off his doubts when Moby Dick reappears moments later. The ''Pequod'' crew sets out in their [[Whaleboat|boats]] to bring him down. In the chaotic altercation, Moby Dick destroys Ahab's boat, but Ahab climbs onto the whale's back and stabs him until Moby Dick submerges, entangling Ahab in the harpoon lines on his back and drowning him. Instead of calling off the hunt, Starbuck orders the men to continue. Moby Dick attacks the boats, smashing them and killing the men; he then rams and sinks the ''Pequod'' before disappearing. Ishmael, the only survivor, manages to cling onto Queequeg's coffin until he is found and picked up by the ''Rachel''.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Gregory Peck]] as [[Captain Ahab]]\n* [[Richard Basehart]] as [[Ishmael (Moby-Dick)|Ishmael]]\n* [[Leo Genn]] as Starbuck\n* [[James Robertson Justice]] as Captain Boomer\n* [[Harry Andrews]] as Stubb\n* [[Bernard Miles]] as the Manxman\n* [[Noel Purcell (actor)|Noel Purcell]] as Ship's Carpenter\n* [[Edric Connor]] as Daggoo\n* [[Mervyn Johns]] as Peleg\n* [[Joseph Tomelty]] as Peter Coffin (voice dubbed by John Huston)\n* [[Francis de Wolff]] as Captain Gardiner\n* [[Philip Stainton]] as Bildad\n* [[Royal Dano]] as Elijah\n* Seamus Kelly as Flask\n* [[Friedrich von Ledebur]] as [[Queequeg]]\n* [[Orson Welles]] as [[Father Mapple]]\n* Tamba Allenby as Pip the cabin boy\n* [[Tom Clegg (actor)|Tom Clegg]] as Tashtego\n* Ted Howard as Perth the blackmith\n* [[Iris Tree]] as Bible woman\n* [[John Huston]] as the voice of Peter Coffin and a Pequod lookout\n* [[Frazer Hines]]\n}}\nPeck was initially surprised to be cast as Ahab (part of the studio's agreement to fund the film was that Huston use a [[Celebrity|\"name\"]] actor as Ahab). Peck later commented that he felt Huston himself should have played Ahab. Huston had long wanted to make a film of ''Moby-Dick'', and had intended to cast his own father, actor [[Walter Huston]] as Ahab, but he had died in 1950.{{sfn|Mirisch|2008|p=72}} Peck went on to play the role of Father Mapple in the 1998 television miniseries adaptation of Melville's novel, with [[Patrick Stewart]] as Ahab.\n\nWelles later used the salary from his appearance to fund his own stage production of ''Moby Dick'', in which [[Rod Steiger]] played Captain Ahab.\n\nGregory Peck, comparing his performances in this film and the 1998 ''Moby Dick'' miniseries, said he liked the miniseries better because it was more faithful to the novel and had a greater sense of adventure.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Captain Ahab, Youghal.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Captain Ahab]] in [[Youghal]] commemorating the filming of ''Moby Dick'' in the town]]\nDuring a meeting to discuss the screenplay, Ray Bradbury informed John Huston that regarding Melville's novel, he had \"never been able to read the damned thing\". According to the biography ''The Bradbury Chronicles'', there was much tension and anger between the two men during the making of the film, allegedly due to Huston's bullying attitude and attempts to tell Bradbury how to do his job, despite Bradbury being an accomplished writer. Bradbury's novel ''[[Green Shadows, White Whale]]'' includes a fictionalized version of his writing the screenplay with John Huston in Ireland. Bradbury's short story \"Banshee\" is another fictionalized account of what it was like to work with Huston on this film. In the television adaptation of the story for ''[[The Ray Bradbury Theater]]'' the Huston character was played by [[Peter O'Toole]] and the Bradbury surrogate by [[Charles Martin Smith]].\n\nThe film's reference to [[Bikini Atoll]] as the home of Moby Dick is not in the novel; Ahab instead plans to engage the whale during [[Equator|\"the Season-on-the-Line\"]].<ref>''Moby Dick'', Chapter 44, \"The Chart\". https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/2701-h/2701-h.htm#link2HCH0044</ref> This peculiar twist seems to be a reference to the recent [[Castle Bravo]] nuclear bomb test at the atoll. This insertion by [[Ray Bradbury|Bradbury]] relates to his atomic bomb short story \"[[There Will Come Soft Rains (short story)|There Will Come Soft Rains]]\".\n\nThe film was bankrolled by brothers [[Walter Mirisch|Walter]], [[Harold Mirisch|Harold]], and [[Marvin Mirisch]], who financed Huston's ''[[Moulin Rouge (1952 film)|Moulin Rouge]]''. The Mirisches made a deal with [[Warner Bros.]] in order to release the film. Under the agreement, WB would distribute ''Moby Dick'' for seven years, after which all rights would revert to the Mirisch brothers' company, Moulin Productions.{{sfn|Mirisch|2008|p=74}}\n\nThe film began shooting in [[Wales]] at [[Fishguard]] and [[Ceibwr Bay]], [[Fishguard]] at Huston's request.{{sfn|Mirisch|2008|p=76}} Parts of the movie were shot at the sea in front of [[Cani\u00e7al]], a traditional [[whaling]] parish in [[Regi\u00e3o Aut\u00f3noma da Madeira|Madeira Islands]], [[Portugal]], with real action of whaling, done by whalers of [[Madeira Island]]. It was also filmed in [[Las Canteras beach]], [[Las Palmas|Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]], [[Canary Islands]], Spain. Captain [[Alan Villiers]] commanded the ship for the film.<!-- Keeping text originally cited, should be used in \"Alan Villiers\" wikipedia entry? , one of the last great tall ship commanders \"commanded square-rigged ships in such films as Moby Dick and [[Billy Budd]]; and commanded a replica ship of the [[Mayflower]] in which he sailed to the USA in 1957 to commemorate the voyage of the Pilgrim Fathers in 1620.\" --><ref>{{cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/journals/pages/OxfordIndex|access-date=2013-07-13|title=Alan Villiers|publisher=Oxford Index}}</ref>\n[[File:Moby Dick pub, Youghal.jpg|thumb|Paddy Linehan's pub, Youghal, which appeared in the film and was renamed \"Moby Dick's\" later]]\nIn order to create a visual effect reminiscent of old whaling prints, a black and white print was superimposed on a color print.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cinea.be/pushing-low-key-limits-a-cinematographic-history-of-noir-and-neo-noir/?language=en |title=Pushing Low-Key Limits: A Cinematographic History of Noir and Neo-Noir |last= Bossche |first=David David Vanden |publisher=Cinea |date=August 18, 2020 |website=cinea.be/ |access-date=May 28, 2021}}</ref> Many exterior scenes set in New Bedford were shot on location in [[Youghal]], Co.

It was renamed Moby Dick's shortly after filming by Linehan. It is still owned and run by the Linehan family and boasts a fine collection of photographs taken of the cast and crew during the making of the film. While there, John Huston used the bar as his headquarters to plan each day's filming. The town's harbor basin, in front of Moby Dick's bar, was used to stand in as New Bedford's harbor, and some local people appear as extras in the ship's departure scene. Youghal's nineteenth century [[lighthouse]] also appears in a scene of the ''Pequod'' putting to sea (at sunset) on her fateful voyage.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youghalonline.com/2010/08/14/moby-dick-youghal-short-film-clip/ |title=Moby Dick Youghal |publisher=YoughalOnline.com |date=14 August 2010 |access-date=2013-07-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312013935/http://www.youghalonline.com/2010/08/14/moby-dick-youghal-short-film-clip/ |archive-date=March 12, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepage.eircom.net/~youghal/chamber/mobydick/index.html |title=Moby Dick's Pub - Youghal, East Cork, Ireland - Chamber Members |publisher=Youghal Chamber of Tourism and Commerce |access-date=2013-07-13}}</ref>\n\nA myth that was put to rest in cinematographer [[Oswald Morris]]' autobiography, ''Huston, We Have a Problem'', is that no full-length whale models were ever built for the production. Previous accounts have claimed that as many as three 60-foot rubber \"white whales\" were lost at sea during filming, making them \"navigational hazards\". In fact the titular whale shown in the film was constructed by [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]] in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], [[England]].<ref name=\"stoke\">{{cite news|title=The Memory: Moby Dick started life in Stoke-on-Trent|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Memory-Moby-Dick-started-life-Stoke-Trent/story-12520541-detail/story.html|access-date=2012-01-14|newspaper=[[The Sentinel (Staffordshire)|The Sentinel]]|date=13 December 2008}}</ref> Moby Dick was 75&nbsp;ft long and weighed 12 [[Long ton|tons]], and required 80 drums of compressed air and a hydraulic system in order to remain afloat and operational.<ref name=\"stoke\"/> However the artificial whale came loose from its tow-line and drifted away in a fog.<ref name=\"stoke\"/> Peck confirmed in 1995 that he was aboard the prop.<ref>{{cite episode|title=A Conversation with Gregory Peck|series=American Masters|series-link=American Masters|air-date=14 October 1999|network=[[PBS]]|season=15|number=6}}</ref> According to Morris, after the prop was lost the ''Pequod'' was followed by a barge with various whale parts (hump, back, fin, tail). Ninety percent of the shots of the white whale are various size miniatures filmed in a water tank in [[Shepperton Studios]] in Surrey, near London. Whales and longboat models were built by a special effects man, [[August Lohman]], working in conjunction with art director Stephen Grimes. Studio shots also included a life-size Moby jaw and head - with working eyes. The head apparatus which could move like a rocking horse was employed when actors were in the water with the whale.{{clarify|date=August 2011}} Gregory Peck's last speech is delivered in the studio while riding the white whale's hump (a hole was drilled in the side of the whale so Peck could conceal his real leg).\n\nThe [[Pequod (Moby-Dick)|''Pequod'']] was portrayed by, appropriately, the ''Moby Dick''. Built in England in 1887 as the ''[[Ryelands (schooner)|Ryelands]]'', the ship came into the hands of the film industry in the 50s, and was also used in ''[[Treasure Island (1950 film)|Treasure Island]]''. It was destroyed by fire in [[Morecambe]], [[England]] in 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morecambe.co.uk/gallery/archive.html|title=Morecambe Archives|access-date=2013-07-13|publisher=Morecambe Online}}</ref> The [[schooner]]s used were ''Harvest King'' and ''[[James Postlethwaite]]'', both from [[Arklow]], Ireland.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Long Watch |last=Forde |first=Frank |publisher=New Island Books |location=Dublin| isbn=1-902602-42-0 |orig-date=First published 1981 |year=2000 |edition=Revised |page=138}}</ref>\n\nThe film went overbudget, from $2 million to around $4.4 million, which crippled Moulin Productions; ''Moby Dick'' was ultimately sold to [[United Artists]] in order to recoup some of the Mirisch brothers' debt (Warner Bros. still distributed the film, corresponding to their original licensing agreement; when the agreement ended, United Artists took over the film's distribution rights.  After UA was acquired by MGM in 1981, the latter studio assumed distribution and holds the film's copyright).{{sfn|Mirisch|2008|p=77}} ''Moby Dick'' did not recoup its budget upon its initial release.{{sfn|Mirisch|2008|p=77}}\n\nPeck and Huston intended to shoot Herman Melville's ''[[Typee]]'' in 1957, but the funding fell through. Not long after, the two had a falling-out. According to one biography, Peck discovered to his disappointment that he had not been Huston's choice for Ahab, but in fact was thrust upon the director by the Mirisch brothers to secure financing. Peck felt Huston had deceived him into taking a part for which Peck felt he was ill-suited. Years later, the actor tried to patch up his differences with the director, but Huston, quoted in Lawrence Grobel's biography ''The Hustons'', rebuked Peck (\"It was too late to start over\", said Huston) and the two never spoke to each other again.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Hustons |publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]] |date=October 1989 |last=Grobel |first=Lawrence |page=[https://archive.org/details/hustons00grob/page/812 812] |isbn=0-684190-19-2 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hustons00grob/page/812 }}</ref>  Nevertheless, Huston's daughter [[Anjelica Huston|Anjelica]] confirmed in a 2003 ''[[Larry King Live]]'' interview that her father had \"adored\" Peck.<ref name=transcripts>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0306/13/lkl.00.html |title=Tribute to Gregory Peck |website=[[CNN.com]] |date=13 June 2003 |access-date=2014-06-26}}</ref>\n\nIn the documentary accompanying the DVD marking the 30th anniversary of the film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', director [[Steven Spielberg]] states his original intention had been to introduce the Ahab-like character Quint ([[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]]), by showing him watching the 1956 version of the film and laughing at the inaccuracies therein.
