'''''Alien Contamination''''', '''''Toxic Spawn''''' or '''''Larvae''''') is a 1980 [[Science fiction film|science fiction]]-[[horror film]] directed by [[Luigi Cozzi]] and starring [[Ian McCulloch (actor)|Ian McCulloch]]. The film is about an alien cyclops creature that uses human agents to place eggs all over Earth. The eggs release a gelatinous goo that causes people to explode when they come into physical contact with the substance.\nThe tagline on the Italian one-sheet (\"...e ora tocca a voi!\") translates as \"...and now it's your turn!\".\n\n== Plot ==\n\nA large ship drifts into [[New York Harbor]], seemingly abandoned. The ship is discovered to be carrying large containers of coffee, hidden inside of which are a series of football-sized green eggs. The crew sent in to explore the ghost ship find the mutilated remains of the former crew gathered in one place, and they soon discover the reason why: when disturbed, the green eggs explode, spraying a viscous liquid over everything. The liquid is toxic to living creatures, and causes the body to immediately explode.\n\nThe military's answer to this phenomenon is Colonel Stella Holmes ([[Louise Marleau|Marleau]]). She establishes a link between the green eggs and a recent mission to Mars that ended badly for the two astronauts who descended to the planet. One of them disappeared, and the other, Commander Hubbard ([[Ian McCulloch (actor)|McCulloch]]), had a breakdown and subsequently became an alcoholic. When pressed, Hubbard agrees to help Holmes in her investigation of the insidious plot to bring the deadly eggs to Manhattan, and it takes them, along with sarcastic New York cop Tony Aris ([[Marino Mas\u00e9|Mas\u00e9]]), to a Colombian [[Economics of coffee|coffee plantation]]. All is not as it seems; Hubbard's former astronaut colleague is apparently alive and well and living under the influence of a monstrous alien cyclops, which is using mind control to further its plot to flood the world with the green eggs and wipe out human life on Earth. Aris falls under the alien's mental influence and is devoured, but Hubbard saves Stella and kills the cyclops by shooting out its eye. Hamilton, only a puppet of the evil alien mind, dies without the alien's power to sustain him. Government agents proceed to confiscate the remaining alien pods. However, a surviving, previously unseen pod explodes on a busy street corner.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Ian McCulloch (actor)|Ian McCulloch]] as Commander Ian Hubbard\n* [[Louise Marleau]] as Colonel Stella Holmes\n* [[Marino Mas\u00e9]] as Lieutenant Tony Aris, NYPD\n* [[Siegfried Rauch]] as Hamilton\n* [[Gisela Hahn]] as Perla de la Cruz\n* [[Carlo De Mejo]] as Agent Young\n* [[Carlo Monni]] as Dr. Turner\n* Mike Morris as Dr. Hilton\n* Martin Sorrentino as Black Warehouse Doorman\n* Angelo Ragusa as Warehouse Doorman\n* Brigitte Wagner as Doctor\n\n== Production ==\n\nAfter the success of his film ''[[Starcrash]]'', director [[Luigi Cozzi]] wanted to follow it up with another science fiction film. On seeing [[Ridley Scott]]'s film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' his producer decided he wanted Cozzi to make something similar.<ref name=\"documentary\">{{cite AV media |year=2003 |title=Alien Arrives on Earth |publisher=[[Blue Underground]]}}</ref> Due to budgetary constraints Cozzi decided to set the film on Earth, although retaining the ideas of the alien eggs and a large creature from Scott's film, and duly wrote a script called ''Alien Arrives on Earth''.<ref name=\"documentary\"/> Producer Claudio Mancini wanted to use the name ''Contamination'', which had been the working title for an aborted film he had been developing based on the [[Jane Fonda]] film ''[[The China Syndrome]]''. The name was duly changed against Cozzi's wishes, with the producer also insisting on Cozzi developing more [[James Bond]]-style elements as opposed to his science fiction theme.<ref name=\"documentary\"/>\n\nThe film's production offices were in the same building as those used by the makers of ''[[Zombi 2]]'' and, impressed by the profits that film had made, Cozzi decided to try to hire the same cast members, although ultimately [[Ian McCulloch (actor)|Ian McCulloch]] was the only actor to work on ''Contamination''.<ref name=\"documentary\"/> Cozzi wanted to use [[Caroline Munro]] (who had been featured in ''Starcrash'') as Colonel Holmes but once again the producer overruled him and hired [[Louise Marleau]] instead.<ref name=\"documentary\"/>\n\n''Contamination'' was shot in eight weeks between 14 January and 4 March 1980.<ref name=\"filmportal\" /><ref name=\"documentary\"/> The film schedule included three weeks in Rome and then a further two weeks split between location shooting in [[New York City]], [[Florida]] and [[Colombia]].<ref name=\"documentary\"/> Cozzi had wanted to use animation or [[stop motion]] photography to realise the alien cyclops at the film's climax but was once again overruled by the producer, and an [[animatronic]] version was constructed instead.<ref name=\"documentary\"/> Cozzi subsequently claimed that this creature failed to work properly and would barely move, so he had to use rapid jump cuts to hide the fact that it was being pulled about by stagehands.<ref name=\"documentary\"/>\n\n== Release and controversy ==\n''Contamination'' was released in West Germany on 9 May 1980, where it was distributed by Residenz-Film.<ref name=\"filmportal\" />\n\nAfter the [[Video Recordings Act 1984|Video Recordings Act]], ''Contamination'' was classed as a [[video nasty]]. Specifically, the film includes graphic depictions of human bodies exploding violently in slow motion, as well as the grisly remains of such explosions. While the explosion effects are not technically graphic (each of the exploding victims is encased in some kind of bulky costume that is obviously hiding the mechanism that sprays the gore), they are extremely bloody.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nYears later, the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] classified the uncut version with a 15 certificate. It was released on home video in the United States under the titles ''Alien Contamination'' and ''Toxic Spawn'', which are both heavily edited. Cozzi later revealed that [[Cannon films|Cannon Films]], the film's North American distributor, had changed the name to ''Alien Contamination'' in order to capitalize on the popularity of Ridley Scott's [[Alien (film)|''Alien'']] (1979).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=Chris|title=30 Years of Contamination|url=https://archive.org/details/Fangoria_296_2010/page/n69|journal=[[Fangoria]]|issue=296|pages=70\u201371, 80|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> It is now available in the US in an unedited version which has been released on DVD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.melonfarmers.co.uk/nasties.htm |title=The Video Nasties List...Tabloid Hysteria |website=The Melon Farmer's Video Hits |access-date=9 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hysteria-lives.co.uk/hysterialives/nasties/nastiesmain2.htm |title=Nasties |website=hysteria-lives.co.uk |access-date=9 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Arrow Video]] released the film uncut on Blu-Ray in 2015. The uncut version runs 95 minutes.\n\n== Critical reception ==\n{{expand section|date=April 2015}}\nIn a contemporary review, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' referred to the film as a \"routine tale\" that was a poorly written horror film that did not hide its Italian origins with \"silly English dialog\" and \"poor dubbing\" being its giveaways.{{sfn|Willis|1985|p=434|ps=: \"Review is of 85 minute English dubbed reviewed on September 1983\"}}\n\nFrom retrospective reviews, [[Kim Newman]] (''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'') stated that the films combination of \"splattery violence\", \"James Bond spy thriller\", and \"monster-filled s-f\" was \"at times uneasy, but Cozzi carries it off with sufficient bravura to paper over the cracks\" and that \"If the film relies on familiar images...it at least has a class, very loud score by Dario Argento's usual collaborators, The Goblins, to punch up the frissons.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|title=Contamination-alien arriva sulla terra|last=Newman|first=Kim|author-link=Kim Newman|page=92|year=1986|volume=53|issue=624|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]}}</ref> Mike Long ([[DVD Talk]]) stated that ''Contamination'' \"makes good use of the ideas that it's stolen, at heart it is simply another boring Euro-horror film.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/5591/contamination/ |title=''Contamination'' : DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video |last=Long |first=Mike |date=11 February 2003 |website=[[DVD Talk]] |access-date=9 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2010 interview with ''[[Fangoria]]'', Cozzi revealed that the film was made as a [[ripoff]] of ''Alien,'' going so far as to say, \"Without the existence of ''Alien'', we could not have made this movie at all\" and that the original title for the film had been ''Contamination: The Alien Arrives on Earth''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n |editor-last=Willis\n |editor-first=Donald\n |title=Variety's Complete Science Fiction Reviews\n |publisher=Garland Publishing Inc.\n |isbn=978-0-8240-6263-7\n |year=1985\n}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* {{IMDb title|id=00082000|title=Contamination}}\n\n{{Luigi Cozzi}}\n\n[[Category:1980 films]]\n[[Category:1980 horror films]]\n[[Category:1980s science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:Alien invasions in films]]\n[[Category:Italian science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:German science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:West German films]]\n[[Category:1980s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about astronauts]]\n[[Category:Films about extraterrestrial life]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Goblin (band)]]\n[[Category:1980s monster movies]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Luigi Cozzi]]\n[[Category:Golan-Globus films]]\n[[Category:Video nasties]]\n[[Category:Italian splatter films]]\n[[Category:1980s Italian films]]\n[[Category:1980s German films]]"}]}}}}
