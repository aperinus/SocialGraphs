It is based on [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s 1961 [[Mother Night|novel of the same name]].\n\n[[Nick Nolte]] stars as Howard W. Campbell, Jr., an [[United States|American]] who moves with his family to [[Germany]] after [[World War I]] and goes on to become a successful German language playwright. As [[World War II]] looms, Campbell meets a man who claims to be from the [[United States Department of War]], and is recruited to spy for the U.S., transmitting [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] propaganda containing hidden messages that can only be decoded by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] intelligence. After the war, Campbell relocates to [[New York City]], where he attempts to live in obscurity.  Since the U.S. government keeps his true wartime role a closely guarded secret, Campbell is forced to live under an assumed identity. The film is narrated by Campbell, through a series of flashbacks, as he sits in a jail cell in [[Israel]], writing his memoirs, and awaiting trial for war crimes.\n\nThe film also stars [[Sheryl Lee]], [[John Goodman]], [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[Alan Arkin]], and [[Frankie Faison]]. Vonnegut makes a [[Cameo appearance|brief appearance]] in a scene in New York City.\n\n==Plot==\nConfined in an [[Israel]]i jail, Howard W. Campbell, Jr. writes a memoir about his career in [[Nazi Germany]]. During the buildup to [[World War II]], Campbell, an American playwright of [[German language]] stage productions, is approached by [[U.S. War Department|War Department]] operative Frank Wirtanen. Wirtanen asks Campbell to work as a spy for the U.S. in the approaching war, though he promises no reward or recognition. Campbell rejects the offer, but Wirtanen adds that he wants Campbell to take some time to consider, telling him that Campbell's answer will come in the form of how he acts and what positions he assumes once the war begins.\n\nIn the initial stages of the war, Campbell works his way up through [[Joseph Goebbels]]' [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Ministry]], eventually becoming the \"voice\" of [[English language]] broadcasts propagating Nazism and [[anti-Semitism]] at American citizens (a parallel to the real broadcaster, Dr. [[Edward Vieth Sittler]]).<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s)/no by-line.--> |title=U.S. Immigration Authorities Asked to Investigate the Sittler Case |url=https://www.jta.org/1959/12/16/archive/u-s-immigration-authorities-asked-to-investigate-the-sittler-case |work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |location= |date=1959-12-16 |access-date=2021-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s)/no by-line.--> |title=Ex-nazi Professor Sittler Resigns from Long Island University |url=https://www.jta.org/1959/12/17/archive/ex-nazi-professor-sittler-resigns-from-long-island-university |work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |location= |date=1959-12-17 |access-date=2021-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/316/312/187412/ |title=Edward Vieth Sittler, Petitioner-appellant, v.

Late in the war, after his wife, Helga, is reportedly killed on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], Campbell visits her family in early 1945 outside [[Berlin]], just before the [[Red Army]] arrives. Helga's younger sister, Resi, confesses that she is in love with him.\n\nEventually, Campbell is captured when an American infantryman recognizes his voice. Before he can be executed, Wirtanen arranges for Campbell's discreet release and helps his relocation to [[New York City]].  Campbell is shocked to learn that the United States government will not reveal Campbell's true role in the war, because that would also reveal the [[Espionage|spycraft]] techniques that America may continue to need for the next [[Cold War|war]].  Although that means that Campbell is doomed to be a pariah, Wirtanen is unsympathetic, reasoning that Campbell would not have wanted the truth known had Germany won the war.\n\nIn New York City, Campbell lives a lonely existence for fifteen years, sustained only by memories of Helga and an indifferent curiosity about his eventual fate. Mrs. Epstein, a [[Holocaust]] survivor living in Campbell's building, is the only person who suspects his true identity; he seems to avoid her suspicions by feigning ignorance of German. Campbell's only friend is George Kraft, an elderly painter who, through an extraordinary coincidence, happens to be a [[KGB|Soviet intelligence]] agent.\n\nOver many games of chess, Campbell reveals his secret past to Kraft, who tries to use this information to improve his standing with his handlers by forcing Campbell into a position where he must flee to [[Moscow]]. He leaks information about Campbell's whereabouts, which gets the attention of a [[neo-Nazi]] organization. Representatives of this group meet Campbell and present him with a woman who seems to be Helga. However, it is not long before Campbell discovers that Helga is actually Resi, who had taken Helga's identity to escape from [[East Germany]].\n\nThe neo-Nazis shelter Campbell, along with Kraft and Resi, in their Manhattan hideout. Wirtanen reappears, warning Campbell of Kraft's true identity and explaining that Kraft and Resi have put Campbell in an awkward position with the neo-Nazis to ensure his transfer to Moscow. Campbell returns to the hideout to confront the pair; in light of her exposure, Resi commits suicide. Moments later, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] raids the hideout but, again, Wirtanen uses his influence to ensure Campbell walks free. Upon his release, he freezes in the middle of a footpath having lost all meaning to his life, until a police officer finally tells him to move along. Campbell returns to his wrecked apartment and decides to turn himself in to the Israelis to stand trial.\n\nCampbell is taken to [[Haifa]], where he is incarcerated in the cell below an unrepentant [[Adolf Eichmann]]. The film ends with the arrival of a letter from Wirtanen providing the corroborating evidence that Campbell was indeed a U.S. spy during the war. Moments later, Campbell hangs himself &mdash; not, he says, for [[crimes against humanity]], but rather for \"crimes against myself.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nick Nolte]] as Howard W.

[[Roger Ebert]] wrote, \"It is a tribute to Nolte's performance that while we are confused about the meaning of the story, we never doubt the presentation of his character.\"<ref>Ebert, Roger (1996-11-15).

Retrieved 2019-01-02.</ref>  He acknowledged, however, that the ambiguity and the discordant tone are faithful to Vonnegut's novel.  [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' observed that the confused message is exacerbated by the outsize emphasis placed on the propagandist speeches delivered by the main character.<ref>Siskel, Gene (1996-11-15).
