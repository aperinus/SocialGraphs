It focuses on a [[documentary film]] crew in the [[Amazon rainforest]] that is captured by a snake hunter who is hunting down a giant, legendary [[green anaconda]]. The film received mostly negative reviews but was a [[box office]] success, grossing $136.8 million worldwide against a $45 million budget, and also became a [[cult following|cult classic]]. It was followed by [[Anaconda (film series)|a series of films]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn the [[Amazon River]], a poacher hides from an unknown creature in his boat. While it breaks through the boat and attempts to catch the poacher, he commits suicide by shooting himself to prevent it from killing him.\n\nMeanwhile, a film crew is shooting a documentary about the Shirishamas, a long-lost indigenous Amazonian tribe. The crew includes director Terri Flores, cameraman and childhood friend Danny Rich, production manager Denise Kalberg, Denise's boyfriend and sound engineer Gary Dixon, narrator Warren Westridge, anthropologist Professor Steven Cale, and boat skipper Mateo. The group encounters stranded [[Paraguay]]an snake hunter Paul Serone, who convinces them he can help them find the Shirishamas. Most of the crew are uncomfortable around Serone, and Cale clashes with him several times about Shirishama lore. Eventually, Cale is stung by a [[wasp]], and an allergic reaction swells up his throat and leaves him unconscious. Serone performs an emergency [[cricothyrotomy]], seemingly saving Cale's life, but soon after, he takes over the boat, forcing the crew to help him achieve his true goal: hunting down a giant record-breaking [[green anaconda]] he had been tracking, which he believes that he can capture alive.\n\nDanny, Mateo and Serone search the wreckage of the poacher's boat. A photograph in an old newspaper reveals that Mateo, Serone, and the poacher were working together to hunt animals, including snakes. Leaving the poacher's ship, Mateo falls into the water, where the giant female anaconda, measuring {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}}, attacks and kills him, while Danny and Serone return to their boat, unaware of Mateo's fate. Serone promises that if the crew helps him find the snake, he will help them get out alive. That night, the anaconda attacks the boat crew. Serone attempts to capture the snake, but it coils around Gary, crushing him. Terri attempts to shoot the anaconda to save him, but Serone knocks her gun away and the snake devours Gary, leaving Denise heartbroken in tears. The crew overpowers Serone and ties him up as punishment.\n\nThe next day, the boat becomes stuck at a waterfall, requiring Terri, Danny, and Westridge to enter the water to winch it loose. Denise confronts Serone and attempts to kill him to avenge Gary's death, but he strangles her with his legs before dumping her corpse into the river. The anaconda returns, and Westridge distracts it long enough for Terri and Danny to return to the boat while Westridge ascends the waterfall. Serone breaks free during the attack and attacks Danny. The anaconda climbs a tree and attacks Westridge, but the tree snaps. The crew winds up in the water, Cale wakes up in the process, and Westridge is killed in the fall from the waterfall. The snake attacks Danny, but Terri shoots it in the head. Serone, still believing he can capture the snake alive, attacks her. Cale stabs him with a tranquilizer dart before losing consciousness again himself, and Danny knocks Serone into the river.\n\nSerone manages to catch up to the group and captures Terri and Danny, using them as bait in an attempt to capture a second, much larger male black anaconda, measuring {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} individual. The snake attacks the pair, slowly suffocating them. Serone attempts to catch the anaconda in a net, but it breaks free and attacks him, eventually swallowing him whole, while Terri and Danny watch as they escape their bonds. The anaconda gives chase to Terri, who retreats into the building and finds a nest full of newborn anacondas. The snake regurgitates the still-alive but partially digested Serone and chases her up a smokestack. Danny pins its tail to the ground with a [[pickaxe]] and ignites a fire below the smoke shack, setting the snake on fire. The resulting explosion sends the burning anaconda flying out of the building and into the water. As Terri and Danny recuperate on a nearby dock, the anaconda resurfaces, but Danny kills it with an axe to the head.\n\nAfterward, Terri and Danny reunite with Cale, who begins to revive on the boat. While floating downriver, the trio suddenly locates the Shirishama tribe, who helps them escape the Amazon.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jennifer Lopez]] as Terri Flores\n*[[Ice Cube]] as Danny Rich\n*[[Jon Voight]] as Paul Serone\n*[[Eric Stoltz]] as Dr. Steven Cale\n*[[Jonathan Hyde]] as Warren Westridge\n*[[Owen Wilson]] as Gary Dixon\n*[[Kari Wuhrer]] as Denise Kalberg\n*[[Vincent Castellanos]] as Mateo\n*[[Danny Trejo]] as Poacher\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Anaconda: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = [[Film score]]\n| artist     = [[Randy Edelman]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = April 22, 1997\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]]s<br />[[Film score]]s\n| length     = 33:56\n| label      = [[Edel America Records]]\n| producer   =\n| chronology = ''Anaconda'' soundtrack\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title = [[Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid#Soundtrack|Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid]]\n| next_year  = 2004\n}}\n[[Randy Edelman]] composed and conducted the film's soundtrack, released by [[Edel America Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/anaconda-mw0000232567|title=Anaconda \u2013 Randy Edelman|website=AllMusic|access-date=April 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n; Track listing\n# Main Title (4:45)\n# Watching and Waiting (4:43)\n# Night Attack (2:47)\n# This Must Be Heaven (1:39)\n# Down River (2:43)\n# Seduction (3:27)\n# Travelogue (2:45)\n# Baiting the Line (2:47)\n# My Beautiful Anna...
