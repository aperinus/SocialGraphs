The screenplay, based on the [[Around the World in Eighty Days|classic 1873 novel of the same name]] by [[Jules Verne]], was written by [[James Poe]], [[John Farrow]], and [[S.J. Perelman]]. The music score was composed by [[Victor Young]], and the [[Todd-AO]] [[70 mm film|70 mm]] cinematography (shot in [[Technicolor]]) was by [[Lionel Lindon]].

Murrow]] presents an onscreen prologue, featuring footage from ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'' (1902) by [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]], explaining that it is based loosely on the book ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'' by [[Jules Verne]].<ref name=\"Greatest\">{{cite web |first= Tim |last= Dirks |title= A Trip to The Moon |work= [[Filmsite.org]] |url= http://www.filmsite.org/voya.html |access-date= January 8, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070117090347/http://www.filmsite.org/voya.html| archive-date= January 17, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> Also included is the launching of an unmanned rocket and footage of the earth receding.\n\nIn 1872, an English gentleman [[Phileas Fogg]] claims he can circumnavigate the world in eighty days. Met with scepticism, he makes a [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]20,000 wager (worth about \u00a3{{Format price|{{Inflation|UK|20000|1872|r=-5}}}} today{{Inflation-fn|UK}}) with four fellow members of the [[Reform Club]] (each contributing \u00a35,000 to the bet) that he can make the journey and arrive back at the club eighty days from exactly 8:45 pm that evening.\n\nTogether with his resourceful French [[valet]], [[Jean Passepartout|Passepartout]], Fogg goes hopscotching around the globe generously spending money to encourage others to help him get to his destinations faster so he can accommodate tight steamship schedules. Having reached Paris they hear that a tunnel under the Alps is blocked. The Thomas Cook agent who assists them offers to hire or sell them his hot air balloon. Fogg buys it and they fly over the Alps drinking champagne.\n\nBlown off-course, the two accidentally end up in Spain, where we see a table-top flamenco sequence performed in a bar. Later, Passepartout engages in a comic bullfight. Next, they go to [[Brindisi]] in Italy. Meanwhile, back in London, suspicion grows that Fogg has stolen \u00a355,000 (around \u00a3{{Format price|{{Inflation|UK|55000|1872|r=-5}}}} today{{Inflation-fn|UK}}) from the [[Bank of England]] so Police Inspector Fix is sent out by [[Scotland Yard]] to trail him (starting in Suez) but must keep waiting for a warrant to arrive so he can arrest Fogg in the British controlled ports they visit.\n\nIn India, Fogg and Passepartout rescue beautiful young widow Aouda from [[Sati (practice)|being forced into a funeral pyre with her late husband]]. The three then travel to Hong Kong, Yokohama, San Francisco, and the [[Wild West]] (including the [[Sioux Nation]]). Reaching New York, they arrange their passage on a cargo steamship travelling to Venezuela - Fogg bribes the captain to go to England. Alas, they run out of coal mid-ocean and the ship stops. Fogg buys the ship and then instructs the crew to take everything that burns, including lifeboats, to provide fuel.\n\nThey arrive in Liverpool, where, still with just enough time left to travel to London and win his wager, Fogg is promptly arrested by the diligent yet misguided Inspector Fix.\n\nDetaining Fogg at the police station, the humiliated Fix discovers that the real culprit has already been apprehended by police in Brighton. Although Fogg is exculpated and free to go, he now has insufficient time to reach London before his deadline, and so has lost everything but the enduring love of the winsome Aouda. Upon returning to London, Fogg asks Passepartout to arrange a church wedding for the next day, Monday. Salvation comes when Passepartout is shocked to be informed that the next day is actually Sunday. Fogg then realizes that by traveling east towards the rising sun and crossing the [[International Date Line]], he has gained a day. Thus, there is still just enough time to reach the Reform Club and win the bet. Fogg rushes to the club, arriving just before the 8:45 pm chime. Passepartout and Aouda then arrive behind him, shocking everyone, as no woman has ever entered the Reform Club before.\n\n==Cast==\nThe film boasts an [[all-star cast]], with [[David Niven]] and [[Cantinflas]] in the lead roles of Fogg and Passepartout. Fogg is the classic Victorian upper-class English gentleman, well-dressed, well-spoken, and extremely punctual, whereas his servant Passepartout (who has an eye for the ladies) provides much of the comic relief as a \"jack of all trades\" for the film in contrast to his master's strict formality. Joining them are [[Shirley MacLaine]] as the beautiful Indian Princess Aouda and [[Robert Newton]] as the determined but hapless Detective Fix, in his last role. Suzanne Alexander and [[Marla English]] were initially the finalists for the role of Princess Aouda, but it was given to MacLaine, who accepted the role after having turned it down twice.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clemens|first=Samuel|title=The Triumph and Tragedy of Suzanne Alexander|year=2021|publisher=Sequoia Press|isbn=9781639720385|page=54}}</ref> Others who pursued the role included [[Sylvia Lewis]], [[Lisa Davis (actress)|Lisa Davis]], and Jaqueline Park.\n\nThe role of Passepartout was greatly expanded from the novel to accommodate Cantinflas, the most famous Latin-American comedian at the time, and winds up as the focus of the film. While Passepartout describes himself as a Parisian in the novel, this is unclear in the film{{spaced ndash}}he has a French name, but speaks fluent Spanish when he and his master arrive in Spain by balloon. In the Spanish version, the name of his character was changed from the French Passepartout to the Spanish Juan Picaporte, the name the character has in the early Spanish translations of the novel. There is also a comic bullfighting sequence which was especially created for Cantinflas and is not in the novel.<ref name=\"Chinchon01\">[http://manolo-eleremita.blogspot.com/2008/11/chinchn-plat-cinematogrfico.html Page in Spanish about movies filmed in Chinch\u00f3n, with photos] Retrieved December 12, 2010</ref> Indeed, when the film was released in some Spanish-speaking nations, Cantinflas was billed as the lead.<ref name=\"Chinchon01\"/> According to the guidebook, this was done because of an obstacle Todd faced in casting Cantinflas, who had never previously appeared in an American movie and had turned down numerous offers to do so. Todd allowed him to appear in the film as a Latin, \"so,\" the actor said himself, \"...to my audience in Latin America, I'll still be Cantinflas.\"\n\nMore than 40 famous performers make brief cameo appearances, including [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Ronald Colman]], [[No\u00ebl Coward]], [[George Raft]], and [[Frank Sinatra]]. The film was significant as the first of the so-called Hollywood \"make work\" films, employing dozens of film personalities.    {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} [[John Wayne]] turned down Todd's offer for the role of the Colonel leading the Cavalry charge,<ref>Wayne's declining the role of the cavalry colonel confirmed by film historian Robert Osbourne on February 12, 2014 following the TCM broadcast of the movie on that date</ref> a role filled by Colonel [[Tim McCoy]].

Todd sold his interest in the [[Todd-AO]] format to help finance the film.<ref name=\"time58\"/>\n\nBecause Todd-AO ran at 30 frames per second, which was incompatible with the 35mm standard of 24 fps, ''Around the World in 80 Days'' was filmed twice, like the first feature in Todd-AO, ''[[Oklahoma! (1955 film)|Oklahoma!]]''. Unlike ''Oklahoma!'', however, which was filmed additionally in 35mm CinemaScope, ''Around the World in 80 Days'' was filmed simultaneously in Todd-AO at 24 frames per second so that from this negative, 35mm reduction prints could be produced for general release. After these two films, the specification for Todd-AO was altered after the third film in the format, ''[[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]'', to 24 fps running, making it unnecessary to film subsequent productions twice.\n\nIn his 1972 autobiographical book ''[[The Moon's a Balloon]]'', actor David Niven discussed his meeting with Todd and the subsequent events that led to the film being produced. According to Niven, when Todd asked him if he would appear as Fogg, Niven enthusiastically replied, 'I'd do it for nothing!' He later admitted to being grateful that Todd did not hold him to his claim. He also described the first meeting between Todd and [[Robert Newton]] (who had  drinking problems) when the latter was offered the role of the detective, Fix; Niven alleged that Newton was offered the part on condition that he did not drink any alcohol during the filming, and that his celebration following the completion of his role led to his untimely demise (he did not live to see the film released).\n\nFilming took place in late 1955, from August 9 to December 20.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The crew worked fast (75 actual days of filming), producing {{convert|680000|ft}} of film, which was edited down to {{convert|25734|ft}} of finished film.

There is also a cat at the Reform Club. The wardrobe department spent $410,000 to provide 74,685 costumes and 36,092 trinkets.<ref name=\"timereview\"/> This is allegedly the most costumes ever required for a Hollywood production.<ref>Turner Classic Movies introduction to the film, February 10, 2019.</ref>\n\n{{Panorama\n|image   = File:Plaza de toros de Chinch\u00f3n.jpg\n|height  = 180px\n|alt     = Bullring in Chinch\u00f3n, Spain\n|caption = The main square of Chinch\u00f3n arranged as a bullring\n}}\n\nSome 10,000 extras were used in filming the [[bullfight]] scene in Spain,{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} with Cantinflas as the matador; Cantinflas had previously done some bullfighting. They used all 6,500 residents of a small Spanish town called [[Chinch\u00f3n]], {{convert|45|km}} from [[Madrid]], but Todd decided there were not enough spectators, so he found 3,500 more from nearby towns. He used 650 Indians for a fight on a train in the West. Many were indeed Indians, but some were Hollywood extras. All 650 had their skin color altered with dye.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Todd used about {{convert|50|gal}} of orange-coloured dye for those extras.\n\nTodd sometimes used models of boats, ships, and trains in the film, but he often decided that they did not look realistic so he switched to the real thing where he could. The scene of a collapsing train bridge is partly without models. The overhead shot of a train crossing a bridge was full scale, but the bridge collapse was a large-scale miniature, verifiable by observing the slightly jerky motion of the rear passenger car as the train pulls away, as well as the slowed-down water droplets which are out of scale in the splashing river below. All the steamships shown in the first half are miniatures shot in an outdoor studio tank. The exception is the American ship shown at the intermission point, which is real. A tunnel was built for a train sequence out of [[paper mache]]. After the train filming was complete, the \"tunnel\" was pushed over into the gorge. Many of the special effects are described and pictured in a 1956 ''Popular Mechanics'' article.<ref>Stimson, Thomas E., Jr. \"Move Magic and Illusions Take You Around The World in Eighty Days.\" Popular Mechanics, August 1956, 65-69.</ref>\n\nThe scenes of the crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by steamship took place off San Francisco and were shot on a specially built prop steamer, a converted barge mocked up to resemble a small ocean-going steamship, with mock paddles driven by the electric motor from an old streetcar. In his memoirs, Niven described the whole thing as being dangerously unstable (though stability improved as it was dismantled as though to feed it into its own furnaces as the plot required).\n\nOne of the most famous sequences in the film, the flight by hydrogen balloon, is not in the original Jules Verne novel. Because the film was made in [[Todd AO]], the sequence was expressly created to show off the locations seen on the flight, as projected on the giant curved screen used for the process. A similar balloon flight can be found in an earlier Jules Verne novel, ''[[Five Weeks in a Balloon]]'', in which the protagonists explore Africa from a hydrogen balloon.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=TOEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA65 \"Movie Magic and Illusions Take You \u2013 Around The World IN 80 Days.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1956, pp. 65-69/226.</ref>\n\nMany of the balloon scenes with Niven and Cantinflas were filmed using a {{convert|160|ft|adj=on}} crane. Even that height bothered Niven, who was afraid of heights. Tom Burges, who was shorter than Niven, was used as a stand-in for scenes where the balloon is seen from a distance. Many of the lots used in the film are now on the land occupied by [[Century City, Los Angeles, California|Century City]], an office complex in the Los Angeles area.\n\nIn his memoirs, Niven related that Todd completed filming while in considerable debt. The post-production work on the film was an exercise in holding off Todd's creditors long enough to produce a saleable film, and the footage was worked upon under the supervision of Todd's creditors and returned to a secure vault each night, as if it were in [[escrow]].\n\nThe film's release and subsequent success vindicated Todd's considerable efforts.\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered on October 17, 1956, at the Rivoli Theater in New York City<ref name=\"nyt56\"/> and played to full houses for 15 months. It ran for 102 weeks at the theatre, with 1,564 performances, 2,173,238 patrons and a gross of $4,872,326.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=NY Rivoli Run Summary|date=October 8, 1958|page=7|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/variety212-1958-10#page/n78/mode/1up|access-date=March 10, 2019|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref>\n\nIt topped ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'s}} monthly box office chart for seven months during 1957.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Standing Headline: December Slumps; 'Joey,' 'April' 'Girls,' 'Nelson Toppers In Boxoffice Tally For Pre-Xmas \n|date=January 1, 1958|page=11|last=Wear|first=Mike|url=https://archive.org/details/variety209-1958-01/page/n10/mode/1up?view=theater|access-date=October 17, 2021|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref> By the time of Todd's death in a private plane crash, 18 months after the film had opened, it had grossed $33 million.<ref name=\"time58\">{{cite web| title= Cinema: The Showman | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,937582,00.html | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080408005657/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,937582,00.html | url-status= dead | archive-date= April 8, 2008 | date= March 31, 1958 | publisher= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]| access-date=October 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy November 1958, the film had earned worldwide rentals of $22 million including $4.6 million from overseas from just 280 engagements.

It was a hit for [[Bing Crosby]] in 1957, and was a staple of the easy-listening genre for many years: \"Around the world, I searched for you / I traveled on when hope was gone to keep a rendezvous ...

However, after the Chicago showing Todd cut four minutes out of the Western sequence where Cantinflas is pursued by Indians. The 70mm print shown at The Rivoli theatre in NYC was 175 minutes. However, the original 35mm Technicolor/anamorphic magnetic stereo and mono optical prints ran the complete 179 minutes with the chase scene intact. Although the leaders on the optical sound prints were labelled for [[Perspecta]] directional encoding, the prints do not contain the signal and were standard mono.\n\nIn 1968, additional cuts were made including removing most of the prologue with the changing aspect ratios. Only a brief few shots with Edward R. Murrow remained and the entire \"Trip to the Moon\" clips were cut. Since the opening shot of Murrow was 1.33 window boxed in the wide frame, they had to crop and blow up that shot for the 2.35 ratio which made it very grainy. The intermission was also cut for the 1968 re-release which included the freeze frame of the ship and fade into the second half. The reels just\n[[jump cut]] with an awkward sound gap between the first and second half. The chase scene was missing from this version too which reduced the running time to 167 minutes. However, some uncut 179-minute 35mm Technicolor prints were struck too which meant at least some theatres played the Roadshow version even though the vast majority showed the shorter cut. 35mm IB/Scope copies of both versions exist from 1968. The 24 frames per second 70mm prints were also the 167-minute version in that year too. As a publicity stunt, Todd Jr. called the press when he removed a 70mm copy from a bank vault claiming it had been stored there since 1956 for safe keeping and was being shown at a theatre again. The copy they exhibited was the cut re-issue 167-minute version.\n\nAround 1976, after its last network television broadcast on CBS, UA lost control of the film to [[Elizabeth Taylor]], who was the widow of producer Michael Todd and had inherited a portion of Todd's estate. In 1983, [[Warner Bros.]] acquired the rights to the film from Taylor, and reissued the film theatrically in a re-edited 143-minute version (this version would subsequently air only once on [[Turner Classic Movies]], this was before any restoration on the movie was announced). In the years that followed, a pan-and-scan transfer of the alternative 24 frame/s version (presented at its full 183-minute length) was shown on cable television.\n\nIn 2004, WB issued a digitally restored version of the 24 frame/s incarnation on DVD, also at its full 183-minute length, but also including the original intermission, [[Entr'acte]], and exit music segments that were a part of the original 1956 theatrical release, and for the first time on home video at its original 2.2:1 aspect widescreen ratio.\n\nThis restored version was reconstructed from the best available elements of the 24 frame/s edition WB could find, and was subsequently shown on [[Turner Classic Movies]]. The original elements from the 30 frame/s/70&nbsp;mm Todd-AO version (as well as the original prints derived from these elements) still exist, albeit in faded condition due to the passage of time, but remain to be formally restored by WB. There is some missing footage in the India train ride where the image artificially fades in and out to compensate for the missing shots.\n\nWarner's retained Andy Pratt Film Labs who in conjunction with Eastman Kodak developed a method to remove the cracked and faded-to-brown, clear lacquer from the original 65&nbsp;mm Technicolor negative. Warners did nothing further to restore the negative. Due to costs of making a 70&nbsp;mm release print even without magnetic striping, using DTS disk for audio, there are no immediate plans for any new prints. The 65&nbsp;mm roadshow print negative was used for the DVD release. Had any 35&nbsp;mm Anamorphic elements been used the aspect ratio would have been 2.35:1. Mike Todd had limited 35&nbsp;mm anamorphic prints made with a non-standard compression ratio to provide a 2.21:1 viewing experience. These special 35&nbsp;mm prints are called Cinestage, the same name of Mike Todd's showcase theatre in Chicago.\n\nBest available prints of the 30 frame/s/70&nbsp;mm version have recently{{when|date=December 2016}} been exhibited in revival movie houses worldwide. As of the present time, WB remains the film's rights holder.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Soundtrack and home media==\nThe DVDs for ''Around the World in 80 Days'' include four hours of supplemental material, in addition to the restored three-hour wide-screen presentation. Included on one of the disks is a documentary film, about 50 minutes long, about Michael Todd.\n\nThe soundtrack was commercially released on vinyl<ref>{{cite book |last=Goodman |first=Fred |date=2015 |title=Allen Klein: The Man Who Bailed Out the Beatles, Made the Stones, and Transformed Rock & Roll |location=Boston, New York |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |pages=27\u201328 |isbn=978-0-547-89686-1}}</ref> and audio tape. Two CD versions were released as well, including a digital remastering of the original Decca Records album on MCA in the 1980s and an expanded version with extra tracks on the Hit Parade Records label in Canada in 2007.
