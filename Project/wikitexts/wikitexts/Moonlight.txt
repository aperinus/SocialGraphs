Little===\nIn [[Liberty City (Miami)|Liberty City]], Miami at the height of the [[Crack epidemic in the United States|crack epidemic]], [[Afro-Cubans|Afro-Cuban]] drug dealer Juan finds Chiron, a withdrawn child who goes by the nickname \"Little,\" hiding from a group of bullies in a [[Drug house|crackhouse]]. He lets Chiron spend the night with him and his girlfriend Teresa before returning Chiron to his mother Paula, who revokes his TV privileges as punishment for worrying her. Chiron continues to spend time with Juan, who teaches him how to swim and mentors him, telling him he can choose his own path in life.\n\nOne night, Juan encounters Paula smoking [[Crack cocaine|crack]] with one of his customers. Juan berates her for being addicted and for neglecting her son, but she rebukes him for selling crack to her in the first place; all the while, they argue over Chiron's upbringing. She implies that she knows why Chiron gets tormented by his peers, alluding to \"the way he walks\" before going home and taking out her frustration on Chiron.\n\nThe next day, Chiron admits to Juan and Teresa that he hates his mother and asks what a \"[[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]\" is. Juan tells him it is \"a word used to make gay people feel bad.\" He tells Chiron there is nothing wrong with being gay and that he should not allow others to mock him. Chiron then asks Juan whether he sells drugs and whether his mother does drugs. After Juan remorsefully answers yes to both questions, Chiron leaves.\n\n===II. Chiron===\nNow a teenager, Chiron juggles avoiding school bully Terrel and spending time with Teresa, who has lived alone since Juan's death. Paula, who has turned to [[prostitution]] due to her worsening addiction, forces Chiron to give her the money he receives from Teresa. Chiron's childhood friend Kevin tells him about a detention he received for being caught having sex with a girl in a school stairwell. Chiron later dreams about Kevin and the girl having sex in Teresa's backyard, waking with a start. One night, Kevin visits Chiron at the beach near his house. While smoking a [[Blunt (cannabis cigar)|blunt]] together, the two discuss their ambitions and the nickname Kevin gave Chiron when they were children. They kiss, and Kevin gives Chiron a [[handjob]].\n\nThe next morning, Terrel manipulates Kevin into participating in a [[hazing]] ritual. Kevin reluctantly punches Chiron until he cannot stand, watching as Terrel and other boys savagely attack him. When the principal urges him to reveal his attackers' identities, Chiron refuses, saying that reporting them will not solve anything. The next day, an enraged Chiron walks into class and smashes a chair over Terrel's head before being restrained by classmates and a teacher. Chiron is arrested and leaves the school in a police cruiser while Kevin watches.\n\n===III. Black===\nNow going by the nickname \"Black,\" an adult Chiron deals drugs in [[Atlanta]]. He receives frequent calls from Paula, who asks him to visit her at the drug treatment center where she is living. One morning, Kevin calls and invites him to see him should he ever come to Miami. While visiting Paula, Chiron breaks his silence. His mother apologizes for not loving him when he needed it most and tells him she loves him even if he does not love her back. The two tearfully reconcile before Paula lets Chiron go.\n\nChiron travels to Miami and visits Kevin at his workplace, a diner. When his attempts to probe Chiron about his life result in silence, Kevin tells him he has had a child with an ex-girlfriend and, although the relationship ended, he is fulfilled by his role as a father. Chiron reciprocates by talking about his unexpected drug dealing and asks Kevin why he called. Kevin plays a song on the jukebox that made him think of Chiron.\n\nAfter Kevin serves his friend Chiron dinner, the two of them go to his apartment. Kevin tells Chiron that, although his life didn't turn out as he had hoped, he is happy, resulting in Chiron breaking down and admitting that he has not been intimate with anybody since their encounter years ago. As Kevin comforts him, Black remembers himself as Little, standing on a beach in the moonlight.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n| align =\n| direction =\n| width =\n| image1 = Trevante Rhodes (32303509424 blurred background).jpg\n| width1 = 416\n| caption1 = [[Trevante Rhodes]]\n| image2 = Andre Holland (32992815392 blurred background).jpg\n| width2 = 420\n| caption2 = [[Andr\u00e9 Holland]]\n| image3 = Naomie Harris 2014.jpg\n| width3 = 416\n| caption3 = [[Naomie Harris]]\n|perrow = 2/3\n|total_width=240\n|height1=544\n|height2=544\n|height3=544\n| image4 = Janelle Mon\u00e1e 2016.jpg\n| width4 = 416\n|height4=544\n| image5 = Mahershala Ali (29953410761).jpg\n| width5 = 416\n|height5=544\n| caption4 = [[Janelle Mon\u00e1e]]\n| caption5 = [[Mahershala Ali]]\n}}\n* Chiron ({{IPAc-en|\u0283|a\u026a|\u02c8|r|o\u028a|n}} {{respell|shy|ROHN}}), the film's protagonist\n** [[Trevante Rhodes]] as Adult Chiron / \"Black\"\n** [[Ashton Sanders]] as Teen Chiron\n** Alex Hibbert as Child Chiron / \"Little\"\n* Kevin, Chiron's romantic interest\n**[[Andr\u00e9 Holland]] as Adult Kevin\n**[[Jharrel Jerome]] as Teen Kevin\n** Jaden Piner as Child Kevin\n* [[Naomie Harris]] as Paula, Chiron's drug addict mother\n* [[Mahershala Ali]] as Juan, a drug dealer who becomes a father figure to Chiron\n* [[Janelle Mon\u00e1e]] as Teresa, Juan's girlfriend\n* Patrick Decile as Terrel, a school bully\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Tarell McCraney (32303406504).jpg|thumb|246x246px|[[Tarell Alvin McCraney]] at the [[2016 Toronto International Film Festival]]|alt=Tarell Alvin McCraney at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival]]\n\nIn 2003, Tarell Alvin McCraney wrote the semi-autobiographical play ''In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue'' to cope with his mother's death from [[AIDS]].

The film takes a form similar to a [[triptych]] in order to explore the path of a man from a neglected childhood, through an angry adolescence, to self-realization and fulfillment in adulthood.<ref name=\"Guardian\" />\n\nThis particular story of Chiron's sexuality is also seen as a story of race in a 'post-[[Obama]]' era. The film amalgamates [[art film]] with [[hood film]] in its portrayal of African-American characters on-screen. Many technical film techniques are employed to juxtapose the characters and action on scene, including the use of an orchestral score done in the melody of popular R&B and hip-hop motifs. This specifically deals with the theme of recuperating identity, especially in terms of blackness.\nThe characters operate in an urban working-class city in Florida\nbut are portrayed through art house conventions to create a new space for black characters in cinema.\nThis mirrors Chiron's own odyssey to learning who he is, as he constantly struggles with trying to find some essentialism to his identity, yet consistently fails in doing so. The triptych structure helps to reiterate the fragmented personality to the film and Chiron.<ref>{{Cite news| title =Watching Moonlight in the Twilight of Obama|last=Kannan|first=Menaka|date=August 1, 2017|work=Humanity&Society|volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=287\u2013298 | doi =10.1177/0160597617719889}}</ref>\n\n=== Black masculinity ===\nThe film's co-writer, [[Tarell Alvin McCraney]], speaks on the topic of black masculinity in the film, explaining why Chiron went to such lengths to alter his persona. He argues that communities without privilege or power seek to gain it in other ways. He says one way in which males in such communities do this is by trying to enhance their masculine identity, knowing that it often provides a means to more social control in a patriarchal society.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|last=BBC Newsnight|title=Moonlight's Tarell Alvin McCraney: 'I'm still that vulnerable boy' - BBC Newsnight|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsmlTyQtu4U| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211030/UsmlTyQtu4U| archive-date=2021-10-30|access-date=2018-12-11}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Moonlight'', masculinity is portrayed as rigid and aggressive, amongst the behavior of young black males in Chiron's teenage peer group.<ref name = Watts>{{Cite web|last=Watts|first=Stephanie|title=Moonlight And The Performativity of Masculinity|url=https://oneroomwithaview.com/2017/02/17/moonlight-performativity-masculinity/|website=One Room with a View|date=February 17, 2017|access-date=February 11, 2019}}</ref> The expression of hyper-masculinity among black men has been associated with peer acceptance and community.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fields|first1=Errol|date=2016|title=The Intersection of Sociocultural Factors and Health-Related Behavior in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Youth: Experiences Among Young Black Gay Males as an Example|journal=Pediatric Clinics of North America|volume=63|issue=6|pages=1091\u20131106|doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2016.07.009|pmid=27865335|pmc=5127594}}</ref> Being a homosexual within the black community, on the other hand, has been associated with social alienation and homophobic judgement by peers because black gay men are seen as weak or effeminate. In the film, Chiron is placed in this divide as a black gay man and alters his presentation of masculinity as a strategy to avoid ridicule because homosexuality is viewed as incompatible with black masculine expectations. As young kids, Kevin hides his sexuality in order to avoid being singled out like Chiron is. As Chiron grows older, he recognizes the need to conform to a heteronormative ideal of black masculinity in order to avoid abuse and homophobia. As an adult, Chiron chooses to embrace the stereotypical black male gender performance by becoming muscular and a drug-dealer.<ref name = Watts/>\n\n''Moonlight'' explores the effects of this felt powerlessness in black males. As McCraney explains, coping with this feeling often coincides with attempts to overstate one's masculinity, in a way that can easily become toxic. He says one unfortunate side effect of leaning into masculinity too much is that men no longer want to be \"caressed, or nurtured, or gentle,\" which is why a character like Juan may be puzzling to some audiences.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Intersection of blackness, masculinity, and vulnerability ===\nBlackness, masculinity, and vulnerability are major focuses of this film.<ref>{{Citation|last=q on cbc|title=Moonlight director Barry Jenkins on changing the perception of manhood|date=2016-10-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7_GimSKeiw| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211030/R7_GimSKeiw| archive-date=2021-10-30|access-date=2019-03-23}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In the beach scene with Chiron, Juan, his father figure in the film, emphasizes the importance of black identity. Juan says, \"There are black people everywhere. Remember that, okay? No place you can go in the world ain't got no black people. We was the first on this planet.\" As Juan speaks about the relevance and importance of the black experience, he also thinks about a time in his youth when a stranger told him \"in moonlight, black boys look blue.\" This is an image that the audience gets to see as the director, Barry Jenkins, supplies numerous shots of Chiron in the moonlight. It seems that Juan seems to associate this image with vulnerability, given that he tells Chiron that he eventually shed the nickname \"Blue\" in order to foster his own identity. The scenes depicting Chiron in the moonlight are almost always the ones in which he's vulnerable, his intimate night on the beach with Kevin included. Throughout the film, this dichotomy between black and blue stands in for that between tough and vulnerable, with the black body often hovering between the two.<ref>{{Citation|last=criticole|title=Pink & Blue in Moonlight|date=2017-02-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE7BQukIJbA| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211030/xE7BQukIJbA| archive-date=2021-10-30|access-date=2019-03-23}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In Chiron's situation, the black body, which can be seen as inherently vulnerable in American society, must be tough in order to survive, as seen by Chiron's final, very masculine and dominant identity.\n\n=== Water ===\nWater is often seen as cleansing and transformative and this is apparent in the film as well. Whether it be him swimming in the ocean or simply splashing water on his face, Chiron is constantly interacting with water. However, it is most notable that water is most often seen in the film in times of immense transition for Chiron. Throughout his life, Chiron resorts to water to bring him comfort e.g. taking baths when his mother is not home or swimming in the ocean with Juan. In the scene where Juan taught Little to swim, he explained to him the duality of water in relation to black existence, a concept addressed in Omise'eke Natasha Tinsley's \"Black Atlantic, Queer Atlantic.\" The ocean is like a crosscurrent as Tinsley says, that can simultaneously be a place of inequality and exploitation as well as beauty and resistance. Tinsley describes how, \"black queerness itself becomes a crosscurrent through which to view hybrid, resistant subjectivities and perhaps, black queers really have no ancestry except the black water.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tinsley|first=Omise'eke Natasha|date=2008-06-01|title=BLACK ATLANTIC, QUEER ATLANTICQueer Imaginings of the Middle
