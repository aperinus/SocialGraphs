Macy]], and [[R. Lee Ermey]]. It tells the [[alternate history]] of a petty criminal named [[Henri Young]] who is sent to [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]] and later put on trial for [[First degree murder|murder in the first degree]]. This film was described on the poster as \"the case that took down Alcatraz\".\n\n==Plot==\n{{More plot|date=February 2022}}\n\nAs a 17-year-old orphan, Henri Young ([[Kevin Bacon]]) steals $5.00 from a grocery store to feed himself and his little sister Rosetta (Amanda Borden), both of whom are destitute. He is apprehended by the shopkeeper (Wally Rose) and Rosetta is sent to an [[orphanage]]. Because that grocery store also housed a [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]], his crime is upgraded to a [[United States federal law|federal]] offense. Young never sees Rosetta again and is sentenced to [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|Leavenworth Penitentiary]], [[Kansas]].\n\nAfter later being transferred to [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|Alcatraz]] where he gets oppressed by associate [[prison warden]] Milton Glenn ([[Gary Oldman]]), he participates in an escape attempt with two other prisoners [[Rufus McCain]] (David Michael Sterling) and [[Arthur Barker]] (Michael Melvin).\n\nThe escape plan fails due to the betrayal of McCain. Barker is killed by the guards and Glenn punishes Young by having him sent to \"[[solitary confinement|the hole]]\", which is in Alcatraz's dungeons where Glenn also had him tortured. Except for 30 minutes on [[Christmas Day]] in 1940, he is left in there for three years. The [[solitary confinement]] causes Young to lose his sanity.\n\nOn release back to the general population, he experiences a [[psychotic]] episode in the prison [[cafeteria]] and attacks McCain, stabbing him to death with a [[spoon]] in full view of the prison staff and the other [[convict]]s.\n\nYoung is put on trial in [[San Francisco]] for [[first degree murder]] in what [[district attorney]] William McNeil ([[William H. Macy]]) and the public-defender's office run by Mr. Henkin ([[Stephen Tobolowsky]]) believe is an open-and-shut case. Public defender James Stamphill ([[Christian Slater]]), a recent graduate of [[Harvard Law School]], is given the case. After discovering the facts of Young's case, Stamphill attempts to put Alcatraz on trial by alleging that its harsh conditions drove him [[insane]].\n\nThe trial overseen by Judge Clawson ([[R. Lee Ermey]]) becomes highly politicized and contentious. While Glenn denied any mistreatment of Young, Stamphill also held Warden James Humson ([[Stefan Gierasch]]) accountable for not being present during Glenn's actions towards Young.\n\nYoung tells Stamphill that he wants to change the plea to guilty as he would rather be dead than be sent back to Alcatraz. Young is convicted of [[involuntary manslaughter]] and not first degree murder. He is returned to Alcatraz and put in \"the hole\" on Glenn's orders with Young claiming that he still won either way. Young was found dead in his confinement prior to his appeal where he has \"victory\" written on the walls. Stamphill's narration stated that Young did not die in vain and thanked him for making him a baseball fan.\n\nThe film concludes with an investigation into Alcatraz. Glenn was convicted for mistreatment and banned from working in the [[US penal system]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Christian Slater]] as James Stamphill, a defense attorney who represents Henri Young.\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as [[Henri Young]], a young man sent to Alcatraz for petty theft.\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as Milton Glenn, the associate [[prison warden]] of Alcatraz.\n* [[Embeth Davidtz]] as Mary McCasslin\n* [[William H.

He had been a hardened [[bank robbery|bank robber]] who had taken a [[hostage]] on at least one occasion and had committed a [[murder]] in 1933. Young was also no stranger to the penal system. Before being incarcerated at Alcatraz in 1936, he had already served time in two [[state prison]]s in [[Montana]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. In 1935 he spent his first year in federal correctional facilities at [[McNeil Island Corrections Center|McNeil Island]], Washington before being transferred to Alcatraz.\n\nThe film ends with the fictional Henri Young being returned to the [[dungeon]]s of Alcatraz in the early 1940s where he supposedly dies. In reality the real Young remained on Alcatraz until 1948 before he was moved to the [[United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners]] at [[Springfield, Missouri]] where he stayed until 1954. While on Alcatraz he remained in the main cell block. Young was not kept in any dungeon as they had been closed almost a decade earlier. In 1954, Young was transferred to the [[Washington State Penitentiary]] at [[Walla Walla, Washington|Walla Walla]] to begin a life sentence for the murder conviction in 1933.\n\nIn 1972, after Young was released from Washington State Penitentiary at age 61, he jumped [[parole]]. According to Washington State authorities his whereabouts remain unknown. Young was born in 1911; if still alive as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, he would be about {{age in years|1911}} years old.\n\nAccording to the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'', April 16, 1941, the Defense stated in court that Henri Young was locked up in [[wikt:solitary confinement|solitary confinement]] for over three years. This is taken directly from the paper, \"Emphasis which they repeatedly laid on the fact that Young was in isolation or solitary confinement for more than three years\u2014and that he drove his [[knife]] into McCain\u2019s [[abdomen]] just eleven days after release from such confinement, made it clear that the defense hopes to show not only that Young was \u201c[[punch-drunk]]\u201d but that the punches were administered by the Alcatraz \"system\".\n\nFour other prisoners attempted to escape Alcatraz with Young, not just two. One of the men omitted from the film (Dale Stamphill) has the same name as Young's lawyer.\n\nMany of the ideas in the movie were taken directly from newspaper articles of the trials, including the ending scene where the jury only convicts Young of manslaughter, and requests that Alcatraz be investigated.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Alcatraz - Henri Young - 244-AZ - 4/7 |url=http://www.notfrisco2.com/alcatraz/bios/hyoung/hyoung4.html |access-date=2022-07-12 |website=www.notfrisco2.com}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released on January 20, 1995 in 1,237 theaters in the U.S. and Canada and grossed $4,719,188 in its opening weekend.
