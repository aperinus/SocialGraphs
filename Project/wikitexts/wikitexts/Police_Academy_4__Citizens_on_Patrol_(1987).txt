It is the fourth installment in the [[Police Academy (franchise)|''Police Academy'' franchise]]. It was released on April 3, 1987 and is the sequel to ''[[Police Academy 3: Back in Training]]''.\n\nA group of Police Academy graduates are sent to train a group of newly recruited civilian officers. The original ''[[Police Academy (film)|Police Academy]]'' cast reprise their roles in the film. [[List of Police Academy characters#Lt./Capt./Cmndt. Thaddeus Harris|Capt. Harris]], not seen since the first installment, returns as the film's nemesis. In ''[[Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment|Police Academy 2]]'' and ''[[Police Academy 3: Back in Training|3]]'', Capt. Mauser (played by [[Art Metrano]]) filled that role, but Metrano asked to be replaced for the remainder of the series after filming number 3. This was the last ''Police Academy'' film to feature Steve Guttenberg as Carey Mahoney.\nThis film also stars a young [[David Spade]] in his feature film debut, as well as featuring a brief appearance from pro skateboarder [[Tony Hawk]] as Spade's double in a skateboarding scene.<ref name=\"famous-fired-celebrity\" /> Despite the commercial success, the sequel was panned by film critics.\n\n==Plot==\nCommandant Eric Lassard decides the police force is overworked and understaffed, so he comes up with the idea of recruiting civilian volunteers to work side by side with his officers in a program called \"Citizens On Patrol\" (COP).\n\nCarey Mahoney and his friends Moses Hightower, Larvell Jones, Eugene Tackleberry, Zed, Sweetchuck, Laverne Hooks, and Debbie Callahan are in charge of training the civilians. The civilians include the enormous Tommy \"House\" Conklin (who Hightower used to babysit), gung-ho senior citizen Lois Feldman, Tackleberry's own father-in-law, and skateboarding delinquents Kyle and Arnie. The latter pair were caught by Capt. Harris, and the judge was about to throw the book at them until Mahoney speaks to the judge to let Arnie and Kyle join the COP program as alternative punishment. The judge agrees, and the boys are joined by their attorney, Butterworth.\n\nBelieving \"the concept of citizens doing police work is asinine\", Harris is determined to see the COP program fail and take over Lassard's job at the academy. When Lassard leaves on an overseas conference, Harris, and his right-hand man Lt. Proctor, are put in charge of the academy and Harris immediately plots to make the COP volunteers quit and leave police work to officers.\n\nThe volunteers, however, do well in their training. Mrs. Feldman excels in firing Tackleberry's [[.44 Magnum]], and they bond amicably (she reminds him of his mother). In training in water safety and drowning victim rescue, Zed \"rescues\" a cadet but 'loses' his [[Mickey Mouse]] watch, saying it was the last thing he ever stole before joining the academy. However, he gains a love interest, a reporter/photographer Laura, who has come to view Lassard's COP program and becomes attracted to Zed. Unfortunately, Harris ruins the moment, insulting them both and inspiring Zed to replace Harris' [[Right Guard]] deodorant with [[Mace (spray)|mace]], which burns his armpits. Despite pranks pulled on him during training, Harris is still determined to make the Citizens on Patrol program fail.\n\nJones learns that volunteers House, Kyle, and Arnie feel ready to go out and arrest criminals, so he, Mahoney, Hightower, and Tackleberry prank the boys, locking them in a prisoner transport van with Hightower, who is posing as a [[Louisiana Voodoo|Voodoo]] practitioner who reanimates his \"dead\" brother (Tackleberry), as a [[Jason Voorhees]]-esque maniac with a chainsaw to make them take training more seriously.  Later, after Captain Harris yells at Zed again, calling him a disgrace, Laura comforts him, saying she thinks he is perfect.\n\nAfter COP volunteers accidentally foil an undercover police sting, the program is suspended, much to Harris' delight. Mahoney believes he did it on purpose to shut down the COP program, paying him back by putting superglue on the mouthpiece of Harris' bullhorn, semi-permanently sticking the mouth guard to its rims. Sometime later, Harris gives some prominent citizens a tour of his precinct when Proctor is tricked into releasing every inmate at the precinct 19 jail, including a team of ninjas, and special guest [[Randall \"Tex\" Cobb]]. After the criminals imprison Harris and his guests, they escape into the street, only to run into Mrs. Feldman, who immediately informs the Lassard academy.\n\nWhen Lassard's officers hear of the jailbreak, COP volunteers are dispatched with the regular officers to catch the escaped felons. After stopping a robbery and a high-speed air balloon chase, the felons are all recaptured. Meanwhile, House, Kyle, Arnie, and Butterworth save Harris and Proctor from drowning in the river after the latters' attempt (and failure) to participate in the chase, and Zed impresses his girlfriend Laura by saving Sweetchuck's life after they both fall out of a plane in mid-air. Several of the police chiefs who witness Lassard's program in action congratulate and compliment him on the program and his officers, much to Harris' dismay.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{main|List of Police Academy characters}}\n\n=== Staff at The Academy ===\n* [[Steve Guttenberg]] as Sergeant Carey Mahoney\n* [[Bubba Smith]] as Sergeant Moses Hightower\n* [[Michael Winslow]] as Sergeant Larvell Jones\n* [[David Graf]] as Sergeant Eugene Tackleberry\n* [[Tim Kazurinsky]] as Officer Carl Sweetchuck\n* [[Leslie Easterbrook]] as Lieutenant Debbie Callahan\n* [[Marion Ramsey]] as Sergeant Laverne Hooks\n* [[Brian Tochi]] as Officer Tomoko \"Elvis\" Nogata\n* [[Lance Kinsey]] as Lieutenant Carl Proctor\n* [[G.W.
