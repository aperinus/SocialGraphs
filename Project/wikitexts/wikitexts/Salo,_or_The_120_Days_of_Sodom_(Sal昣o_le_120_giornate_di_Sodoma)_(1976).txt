The film is a loose [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of the 1785 novel (first published in 1904) ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom]]'' by the [[Marquis de Sade]], updating the story's setting to the [[World War II]] era. It was Pasolini's final film, being released three weeks after [[Pier Paolo Pasolini#Murder|his murder]].\n\nThe film focuses on four wealthy, corrupt Italian [[libertine]]s in the time of the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Italian Social Republic|Republic of Sal\u00f2]] (1943\u20131945). The libertines kidnap 18 teenagers and subject them to four months of extreme violence, [[Sadomasochism|sadism]], and sexual and psychological [[torture]]. The film explores themes of [[political corruption]], [[consumerism]], [[authoritarianism]], [[nihilism]], [[morality]], [[capitalism]], [[totalitarianism]], [[Sadomasochism|sadism]], [[sexuality]], and [[fascism]]. The story is in four segments, inspired by [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'': the Anteinferno, the Circle of Manias, the Circle of Shit, and the Circle of Blood. The film also contains frequent references to and several discussions of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s 1887 book ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'', [[Ezra Pound]]'s poem ''[[The Cantos]]'', and [[Marcel Proust]]'s [[novel sequence]] ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''.\n\nPremiering at the Paris Film Festival on 23 November 1975, the film had a brief theatrical run in Italy before being banned in January 1976, and was released in the United States the following year on 3 October 1977. Because it depicts youths subjected to graphic violence, torture, sexual abuse, and murder, the film was controversial upon its release and has remained banned in many countries.\n\nThe confluence of thematic content in the film\u2014ranging from the political and socio-historical, to psychological and sexual\u2014has led to much critical discussion. It has been both praised and decried by various film historians and critics and was named the 65th-scariest film ever made by the [[Chicago Film Critics Association]] in 2006.<ref name=\"Chicago Film Critics Association\">{{cite web|author=Chicago Film Critics Association|url=http://www.filmspotting.net/top100.htm|title=Top 100 Scariest Movies|date=October 2006|publisher=[[Filmspotting]]|access-date=21 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117102530/http://www.filmspotting.net/top100.htm |archive-date=17 January 2008}}</ref> It is also the subject of an entry in ''[[The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural]]'' (1986).<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Sal\u00f2 \u2013 The 120 Days of Sodom|author=Campbell, Ramsey|author-link=Ramsey Campbell|title=The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural|editor=Sullivan, Jack|editor-link=Jack Sullivan (literary scholar)|page=[https://archive.org/details/penguinencyclope00sull/page/368 368]|publisher=Penguin|year=1986|isbn=978-0-670-80902-8|title-link=The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is separated into four segments with intertitles, inspired by [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'':<ref>{{cite book|title=Post-Politics in Context|author=Taskale, Ali Raza|page=59|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn= 978-1-317-28249-5}}</ref>\n\n===Anteinferno===\n\nIn 1944, in the Republic of Sal\u00f2, the Fascist-occupied portion of Italy, four wealthy men of power - the Duke, the Bishop, the Magistrate, and the President - agree to marry each other's daughters as the first step in a debauched ritual. They rule that when they get to the mansion their daughters must be completely naked at all times. They recruit four teenage boys to act as guards (dressed with uniforms of [[Decima Flottiglia MAS]]) and four young soldiers (called \"studs\", \"cockmongers\", or \"fuckers\"), who are chosen because of their large penises. The army and secret police is sent to round up many youths, of whom nine young men and nine young women are hand-picked and brought to a palace near [[Marzabotto]]. One of the boys tries to escape on the way, but is shot to death.\n\n===Circle of Manias / {{lang|it|Girone delle Manie}}===\n\nAccompanying the libertines at the palace are four middle-aged prostitutes, also collaborators, whose job it is to orchestrate debauched interludes for the men, who sadistically exploit their victims. During the many days at the palace, the four men devise increasingly abhorrent tortures and humiliations for their own pleasure. During breakfast, the daughters enter the dining hall naked to serve food. One of the studs trips and rapes a daughter in front of the crowd, who laugh at her cries of pain. Intrigued, the President moons several slaves before prompting the stud to perform [[anal sex]] on him and the Duke sings \"{{lang|it|italic=no|Sul Ponte di perati}}\". Signora Vaccari uses a mannequin to demonstrate to the young men and women how to properly [[masturbate]] a penis and one of the girls tries to escape, only to have her throat cut. Signora Vaccari continues with her story. Two victims named Sergio and Renata are forced to get married. The ceremony is interrupted when the Duke fondles several victims and sex workers. At the end, Sergio and Renata are forced to fondle each other and the men rape them to stop them from having sex with each other. During this, the Magistrate engages with the Duke in three-way intercourse.\n\nOn another day, the victims are forced to get naked and act like dogs. When one of the victims, Lamberto, refuses, the Magistrate [[Flagellation|whips]] him and tortures the President's daughter by tricking her into eating a slice of [[polenta]] containing nails.\n\n===Circle of Shit / {{lang|it|Girone della Merda}}===\n\nSignora Maggi relates her troubled childhood and her [[coprophilia]]. As she tells her story, the President notices that one of the studs has an erection and fondles him; another stud uses a female victim's hand to masturbate himself. She also explains how she killed her mother over a dispute about her prostitution and Renata cries, remembering the murder of her own mother. The Duke, sexually excited at the sound of her cries, begins verbally abusing her. The Duke orders the guards and studs to undress her. During this, she begs [[God]] for death and the Duke punishes her by defecating on the floor and forcing her to eat his feces with a spoon. The President leaves to masturbate. Later, at a mock wedding reception for the Magistrate and Sergio, the victims are presented with a meal of human feces. During a search for the victim with the most beautiful buttocks, Franco is picked and promised death in the future.\n\n===Circle of Blood / {{lang|it|Girone del Sangue}}===\n\nLater, there is a [[Black Mass]]-like wedding between the studs and the men of power while the latter are dressed in drag. The men angrily order the children to laugh, but they are too grief-stricken to do so. The Pianist and Signora Vaccari tell dark jokes to make the victims laugh. The wedding ceremony ensues with each man of power exchanging rings with a stud. After the wedding, the Bishop consummates the marriage and receives intense anal sex from his stud. The Bishop then leaves to examine the captives in their rooms, where they start systematically betraying each other: Claudio reveals that Graziella is hiding a photograph, Graziella reveals that Eva and Antiniska are having a secret sexual affair. Victim Umberto is appointed to replace Ezio, who is shot to death for having sex with one of the staff.\n\nToward the end, the remaining victims are called out to determine which of them will be punished. Graziella is spared due to her betrayal of Eva, and Rino is spared due to his submissive relationship with the Duke. Those who are called are given a blue ribbon and sentenced to a painful death, while those who have not been called, as long as they kept collaborating with the libertines, can hope to return home. The victims huddle together and cry and [[prayer|pray]] in the bathroom. They are then taken outside and raped, tortured and murdered through methods such as [[Human branding|branding]], hanging, [[scalping]], burning and having their tongues and eyes cut out, as each libertine takes his turn to watch as a [[Voyeurism|voyeur]]. The soldiers shake hands and bid each other farewell. The Pianist, looking out an open window, suddenly realises with horror what atrocities are being committed and, climbing out, throws herself to her death.\n\nTwo young soldiers, who had witnessed and collaborated in all the atrocities, dance a simple [[waltz]] together; one asks the name of the other's girlfriend back at home.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''Masters'''\n* [[Paolo Bonacelli]] (dubbed by Giancarlo Vigorelli) as The [[Duke of Blangis|Duke]]; tall, strongly built, bearded, [[Chauvinism|chauvinistic]], very sadistic and a fanatic fascist; enjoys tormenting female victims with verbal abuse and degrading them, his favorite victims being Renata and Fatimah.

The exceptions are Maurizio Valaguzza (Bruno), Bruno Musso (Carlo Porro), Lamberto Book (Lamberto Gobbi), Gaspare di Jenno (Rino), Marco Lucantoni (Ferruccio Tonna), Faridah Malik (Fatimah), Olga Andreis (Eva), and Dorit Henke (Doris).\n\n==Production==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Conception===\nPasolini's writing collaborator [[Sergio Citti]] had originally been attached to direct the intended adaptation of the [[Marquis de Sade]]'s ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom]]''.{{sfn|Pasolini|Biett|Davoli|2002|loc=(05:25)}} During the creation of the first drafts of the script, Pasolini appealed to several of his usual collaborators, among them Citti, Claudio Masenza, Antonio Troisi and specially [[Pupi Avati]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2015/11/02/spettacoli/pupi-avati-io-che-scrissi-sal-non-lho-mai-visto-fino-in-fondo-xS8d30OxVX7btaZQrJ4JKN/pagina.html|work=La Stampa Spettacoli|language=it|title=Pupi Avati: io che scrissi 'Sal\u00f2', non-l'ho mai visto fino in condo\n|author=Giubilei, Franco|date=11 February 2015|access-date=4 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhile collaborating with Citti on the script, Pasolini was compelled to transpose the setting of ''Sal\u00f2'' from 18th-century France (as depicted in de Sade's original book) to the last days of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s regime in the Republic of Sal\u00f2 in the spring of 1944.{{sfn|Wells|2008|p=127}} Sal\u00f2 is a toponymical metonymy for the [[Italian Social Republic]] (RSI) (because Mussolini ruled from this northern town rather than from Rome), which was a [[puppet state]] of [[Nazi Germany]].{{sfn|Annovi|2017|p=41}} While writing the script, it was decided between Citti and Pasolini that the latter would direct the project, as Citti had planned to write a separate project after completing ''Sal\u00f2''.{{sfn|Pasolini|Biett|Davoli|2002|loc=(05:22)}} Pasolini noted his main contribution to Citti's original screenplay as being its \"[[Dante]]-esque structure\",{{sfn|Pasolini|Biett|Davoli|2002|loc=(05:29)}} which Pasolini felt had been de Sade's original intention with the source material.{{sfn|Pasolini|Biett|Davoli|2002|loc=(05:38)}}\n\nIn the film, almost no background is given on the tortured subjects and, for the most part, they almost never speak.<ref name=\"Kerner2011\">{{cite book|author=Aaron Kerner|title=Film and the Holocaust: New Perspectives on Dramas, Documentaries, and Experimental Films|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lMGoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT61|date=5 May 2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-0893-7|pages=61\u2013}}</ref> Pasolini's depiction of the victims in such a manner was intended to demonstrate the physical body \"as a commodity... the annulment of the personality of [[Other (philosophy)|the Other]].\"{{sfn|Pasolini|Biett|Davoli|2002|loc=(07:38)}} Specifically, Pasolini intended to depict what he described as an \"anarchy of power\",{{sfn|Pasolini|Biett|Davoli|2002|loc=(07:47)}} in which sex acts and physical abuse functioned as metaphor for the relationship between power and its subjects.{{sfn|Pasolini|Biett|Davoli|2002|loc=(07:08)}} Aside from this theme, Pasolini also described the film as being about the \"nonexistence of history\" as it is seen from Western culture and [[Marxism]].{{sfn|Pasolini|Biett|Davoli|2002|loc=(08:12)}}\n\n====Trilogy of death====\nIn contrast to his \"Trilogy of Life\" (''[[Il Decameron]]'', ''[[I racconti di Canterbury]]'' and ''[[Il fiore delle Mille e una notte]]''), Pasolini initially planned ''The 120 days of Sodom'' and ''Sal\u00f2'' as separate stories, but noting similarity between both concepts \u2013 and based on their experiences in the Republic of Sal\u00f2 \u2013 conceived the idea of ''Sal\u00f2 or the 120 Days of Sodom''. Pasolini established that the violent scenes in ''Sal\u00f2'' were symbolic and reduced the romanticism of his previous films, although knowing that once the film was premiered would be considered as damned.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} As a continuation, Pasolini planned to make a biographical film about the life of child murderer [[Gilles de Rais]], but died.\n\n===Casting===\nInitially, [[Ninetto Davoli]] was chosen to play Claudio, a young collaborationist, but due to legal problems he had to decline, the role being replaced by Claudio Troccoli, a young man who had a similarity to Davoli in his first films. Pupi Avati, being the writer, is not officially accredited due also to legal problems. Most of the actors of the cast, although they were natural performers, were non-professionals with minimal or no prior on-camera acting experience. Many of them were models, cast for their willingness to appear naked on-screen.\n\n[[Franco Merli]] was considered like a prototype of the Pasolinian boy. Ezio Manni remembers during filming: \"The same with Franco Merli, the guy chosen for having the most beautiful butt. When they reward him by holding the gun to his head, he suddenly protested, he couldn\u2019t handle that scene.

The filmic material of ''Sal\u00f2'' is one that compacts celluloid and feces, in Pasolini's desire to burst the limits of cinema, via the anally resonant eye of the film lens.\"{{sfn|Barber|2010|p=100}} Barber also notes that Pasolini's film reduces the extent of the storytelling sequences present in de Sade's ''The 120 Days of Sodom'' so that they \"possess equal status\" with the sadistic acts committed by the libertines.{{sfn|Barber|2010|pages=99\u2013102}}\n\nPasolini scholar Gian Annovi notes in the book ''Pier Paolo Pasolini: Performing Authorship'' (2007) that ''Sal\u00f2'' is stylistically and thematically marked by a \"link between [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]]'s [[Dada]] aesthetics and the perverse dynamics of desire\", which, according to Annovi, became artistic points of interest for Pasolini in the early developments of ''Sal\u00f2''.{{sfn|Annovi|2007|p=176}}\n\n==Legacy==\n''Sal\u00f2'' has earned a reputation among some film scholars for being the \"sickest film of all time\",{{sfn|Mathjis|Sexton|2011|p=106}}<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mathjis, Ernest|author2=Mendik, Xavier|title=100 Cult Films|page=177|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2011|isbn= 978-1-844-57571-8}}</ref> with some citing it as an early progenitor of the [[extreme cinema]] subgenre, alongside the American film ''[[The Last House on the Left]]'' (1972).<ref>{{cite book|title=Transnational Horror Across Visual Media: Fragmented Bodies|chapter='You Had Me at \"I'm Dead{{\"'}}: Porn, Horror, and the Fragmented Body|author1=Hyland, Jenn|author2=Shorey, Eric|page=176|publisher=Routledge|editor1= Och, Dana|editor2=Strayer, Kirsten|year=2013|isbn= 978-1-136-74484-6}}</ref>\n\nFilm scholar Matthias Frey notes that the cross-section between the film's thematic content and graphic visuals has resulted in it being considered both a horror film as well as an [[art film]]:\n\n{{blockquote|[Films like ''Sal\u00f2''], which are usually considered by critics as 'works' by the 'artists'&nbsp;... might be received in practice also by individuals who watch ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' or ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' or any 'popular' or cult horror film.<ref name=frey>{{cite book|author=Frey, Mattias|page=114|chapter=The Ethics of Extreme Cinema|title=Cine-Ethics: Ethical Dimensions of Film Theory, Practice, and Spectatorship|editor1=Choi, Jinhee|editor2=Frey, Mattias|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn= 978-1-136-74596-6}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 2006, the [[Chicago Film Critics Association]] named it the 65th-scariest film ever made.<ref name=\"Chicago Film Critics Association\"/>\n\nIn 2010, the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] placed it at no. 47 on its list of \"The Essential 100 films\".<ref name=\"Toronto International Film Festival\">{{cite web|title=The Essential 100|url=http://tiff.net/essential/about/essential100|work=[[Toronto International Film Festival]]|publisher=Toronto International Film Festival Inc.|access-date=22 November 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226144923/http://tiff.net/essential/about/essential100|archive-date=2010-12-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, British opera director [[David McVicar]] and Swiss conductor [[Philippe Jordan]] produced a performance of the [[Richard Strauss]] opera ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' (1905) based on the film, setting it in a debauched palace in Nazi Germany, for the [[Royal Opera House]] in London, with [[Nadja Michael]] as [[Salome]], [[Michaela Schuster]] as [[Herodias]], [[Thomas Moser]] as [[Herod Antipas|Herod]], [[Joseph Kaiser]] as Narraboth, and [[Michael Volle]] as [[John the Baptist|Jokanaan]].
