Its box office receipts were only 20% of its estimated $10 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film picks up directly after the events of the previous film. The capsized luxury liner [[steamship|S.S.]] ''[[Poseidon (fictional ship)|Poseidon]]'' is still afloat after six survivors have been rescued by the [[Maritime Gendarmerie|French Coast Guard]].\n\nTugboat captain Mike Turner spots the rescue helicopter and subsequently finds the shipwreck. Accompanied by second mate Wilbur and passenger Celeste Whitman, he heads out to claim [[Marine salvage|salvage]] rights, as the tugboat ''Jenny'' lost her cargo in the same [[tsunami]] that capsized the ''Poseidon''.\n\nThey are soon followed by Dr. Stefan Svevo and his crew, who claim to be [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] medics who received the ship's [[SOS]]. They board the doomed vessel through the bottom hull opening left by the French rescue team, then become trapped after the entrance collapses. The group with Turner encounters the ship's nurse, Gina Rowe and two passengers, elegantly dressed Suzanne Constantine and war veteran Frank Mazzetti, who is searching for his missing daughter Theresa. Theresa is found, as are [[elevator operator]] Larry Simpson and a \"billionaire\" called \"Tex\" who clings to a valuable bottle of wine. Later they also find the blind Harold Meredith and his wife Hannah, who were waiting to be rescued.\n\nWater continues to submerge decks and more explosions occur. Turner and his group find the [[purser]]'s office, where Svevo decides he and his men will search for other survivors, parting ways with Turner's group. Another explosion causes the safe in the purser's office to fall through the [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] and open, revealing gold coins, diamonds and cash. Turner and Wilbur excitedly gather the coins.\n\nUnknown to Turner and the survivors, Suzanne is actually working with Svevo. She takes a list containing information about a cargo of crates from the purser's office. Going off on her own, she gives Svevo the document but decides to rejoin Turner's group. Svevo orders Doyle, one of his men, to kill Suzanne. He shoots her, but before she dies she strikes Doyle with an axe, killing him. While making their way up through the decks, Turner and the others find Suzanne's corpse and reach the unpleasant conclusion that a murderer is on board.\n\nHannah dislocates her shoulder while helping her husband. Svevo and his men are found gathering a cargo of [[plutonium]]. Svevo reveals that his real intention for boarding the ''Poseidon'' was to retrieve his lost shipment of plutonium, adding that he can't let Turner and his group go now. However, before anyone is killed, another explosion occurs, allowing Turner's group to escape through another cargo room.\n\nTurner, Mazzetti and Simpson find guns and attempt to make a fight of it. In the ensuing shoot-out, Mazzetti and Castrop, another of Svevo's men, are killed. Water floods the deck as Turner's group proceeds up to the next deck, where an injured Hannah is unable to climb a ladder: she falls into the rising water and drowns. While trying to rescue her, Turner loses all of his salvaged gold. Svevo and his one remaining gunman head back up to the ship's stern, where the rest of Svevo's team attempt to use a crane to raise the plutonium up to the hull, which is still above water but is slowly sinking.\n\nIn another section of the ship, Turner and the survivors exit the ship through an underwater side door, but due to shortage of [[scuba tank]]s, Wilbur (unknown to Turner and his group) sacrifices himself by swimming underwater and disappearing. Turner and Celeste swim to the tugboat ''Jenny'' and move it closer to the ''Poseidon'' as the remaining survivors swim towards it. Svevo's men see them and open fire. Tex, who in reality was not a wealthy passenger but a [[sommelier]] (part of the ''Poseidon''{{'}}s crew), holds onto his wine bottle as he is gunned down and perishes. The rest of Turner's group makes it to his tugboat and they sail away. Water continues to flood the ''Poseidon'', causing the boilers and then the plutonium cargo to erupt, exploding the ship's hull and sinking it stern first. As it sinks, Svevo and his men are killed.\n\nOn board Turner's boat, Turner accepts that his tugboat ''Jenny'' will be taken from him when they get to port, but Celeste reveals a diamond she salvaged from the ''Poseidon''. Celeste asks Turner, \"Are you going to kiss me now?\" and Turner replies, \"I was going to kiss you anyway.\" They do so and the tugboat ''Jenny'' sails away into the sunset with the six survivors.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n=== Salvage team ===\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Captain Mike Turner\n* [[Karl Malden]] as Wilbur Hubbard\n* [[Sally Field]] as Celeste Whitman\n\n=== Greek salvage team ===\n* [[Telly Savalas]] as Dr. Stefan Svevo\n* [[Paul Picerni]] as Kurt\n* Patrick Culliton as Doyle\n* Dean Raphael Ferrandini as Castrop\n{{col-break}}\n\n=== ''Poseidon'' passengers ===\n* [[Peter Boyle]] as Frank Mazzetti\n* [[Angela Cartwright]] as Theresa Mazzetti\n* [[Jack Warden]] as Harold Meredith\n* [[Shirley Knight]] as Hannah Meredith\n* [[Veronica Hamel]] as Suzanne Constantine\n\n=== ''Poseidon'' crew ===\n* [[Shirley Jones]] as Nurse Gina Rowe\n* [[Slim Pickens]] as Dewey \"Tex\" Hopkins\n* [[Mark Harmon]] as Elevator Operator Larry Simpson\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Production ==\nIn 1973, soon after the first film came out, producer [[Irwin Allen]] proposed a sequel that would have had the survivors testifying in a hearing on the disaster in [[Austria]], the country of the ''Poseidon''{{'}}s parent company. While on a train to the hearing, a miles-long mountain tunnel would collapse, leaving the survivors of the train trapped inside, struggling to make their way out. The film was planned to be released at Christmas 1974 from [[20th Century Fox]]. Most of the main cast was initially intended to reprise their roles from the first film.<ref name=\"AFI\" /> This premise was eventually used in the [[Rob Cohen]] film ''[[Daylight (1996 film)|Daylight]]'' (1996) with [[Sylvester Stallone]].<ref>From Special Edition DVD ''Beyond the Poseidon Adventure'' Actor Commentary</ref>\n\nOriginally planned with the first film's distributor [[20th Century Fox]], the film ended up moving to [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] after they signed a three picture deal with Allen in 1975.<ref name=\"AFI\" />\n\n=== Relationship of Gallico's novels to the films ===\n[[Paul Gallico]]'s novel ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (novel)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' had ended with the ship's sinking. The [[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|original film]] changed much of the novel's plot and ended with the ship still afloat. After the huge success of the film, Gallico was asked to write a novel that would be a sequel not to his first novel, but to the film. It would feature a new group of people entering the still capsized ship and could be made into a second film. In response, Gallico started writing ''Beyond the Poseidon Adventure'', however, he died on July 15, 1976 before completing the book.<ref name=AFI/> The book was published on January 1, 1978. Once again the film that followed ended up bearing little resemblance to his book. Instead of sinking, the ship explodes along with Svevo and his men.\n\n=== Filming ===\nFilming started September 1978 at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|Burbank Studios]] with location shooting off the California coast and [[Santa Catalina Island (California)|Catalina Island]]. For the year prior, the ship interior set was designed and built, based on the {{RMS|Queen Mary}}.<ref name=AFI/>\n\n== Reception ==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 0% based on reviews from 8 critics, with an average rating of 3.50/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beyond_the_poseidon_adventure |title=Beyond the Poseidon Adventure (1979) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=June 21, 2021}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] the film has a [[weighted mean|weighted average]] score of 22 out of 100, based on 6 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/beyond-the-poseidon-adventure |title=Beyond the Poseidon Adventure (1979) reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |access-date= April 4, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film one star out of four.<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite news |date=January 1, 1979 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=Beyond the Poseidon Adventure |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/beyond-the-poseidon-adventure-1979 |access-date=December 17, 2020 }}</ref>  [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Irwin Allen \"is so obviously ill-equipped to stage action scenes in cramped quarters that his audience winds up wishing as fervently as his characters for a chance to see the light of day.\"<ref>Maslin, Janet (May 25, 1979). \"[https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/25/archives/film-poseidon-returnsinside-a-floating-hulk.html Film: 'Poseidon' Returns\u2014Inside a Floating Hulk]\".
