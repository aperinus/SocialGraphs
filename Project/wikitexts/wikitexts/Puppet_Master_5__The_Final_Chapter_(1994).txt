It is the fifth film in the [[Puppet Master (franchise)|''Puppet Master'' franchise]], the [[sequel]] to 1993's ''[[Puppet Master 4]]'', and stars [[Gordon Currie (actor)|Gordon Currie]] as the series' [[Puppet Master 4|third Puppet Master]], and [[Ian Ogilvy]], his colleague, whose attempts to salvage the animated [[puppet]]s of [[Andre Toulon|Andr\u00e9 Toulon]] ([[Guy Rolfe]]) from the Bodega Bay Inn are foiled by a [[demon]].\n\nAs in the previous film, the puppets serve as protagonists, rather than terrorize as they had in the [[Puppet Master (film)|first]] and [[Puppet Master II|second]] films. As the subtitle indicates, ''Puppet Master 5'' was intended to be the final installment. However, in 1998, a sixth, ''[[Curse of the Puppet Master]]'', was released, and the series has been ongoing since.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing the events of [[Puppet Master 4|the previous film]], Rick Myers has been [[arrested]] under the suspicion of having caused the murders of Dr. Piper and Baker, but Dr. Jennings, the new director of the [[Artificial Intelligence]] research project and Rick's temporary superior, gets him out on [[bail]]. Blade has been confiscated, but he escapes from the police department's evidence room and jumps into Susie's purse as she comes to fetch Rick. Lauren lies comatose in the hospital following the events in the inn. Meanwhile, in the underworld, Sutekh decides to take matters into his own hands and infuses his life essence into his own Totem figure.\n\nWhile Jennings professes [[scepticism]] toward Rick's story, he becomes actually quite interested in acquiring Toulon's [[secret]], especially since the project's unofficial sponsors are luring with a sizeable contribution, should he succeed in presenting a prototype soon. Jennings returns to the [[Hotel Green|Bodega Bay Inn]] with three hired thugs - Tom Hendy, Jason, and Scott - to collect the puppets and the formula, but in the meantime Rick is roused by a [[nightmare]] and finds Blade by his side. Sensing that something is about to happen, Rick and Blade depart for the [[hotel]]. Susie, while paying a visit to Lauren, witnesses her friend receiving a vision of [[Set (deity)|Sutekh]] and his [[Totem]]. Unable to contact Rick, she proceeds to the hotel as well.\n\nWhile searching the building, Jason and Hendy are ambushed and killed by Sutekh, and Scott encounters and is knocked out by Pinhead and Jester. Jennings also encounters Sutekh but is saved by Torch and Six-Shooter; and the puppets start fighting back against Sutekh. Rick goes back to his room and runs into Suzie, but they both get locked in by Sutekh's powers. Through his computer, Rick gets in contact with Lauren, who tells him to activate The Decapitron. Jennings enters the room and tries to convince Rick to collect the puppets and leave the hotel. In the meantime, Scott recovers, but is also found and slain by Sutekh.\n\nJester enters the room and leads Rick to where the Decapitron is hidden. Rick, Suzie and Jennings proceed to revive Decapitron, and [[Andre Toulon|Toulon]] advises them to leave the hotel while the puppets will engage Sutekh. Jennings, however, insists on taking one of the puppets with him, despite Rick and Suzie's warnings. Rick, Suzie, and Jennings take the elevator down, but then Jennings attacks and knocks out Rick, while Suzie is pushed out of the cabin. But when Jennings exits the elevator, he is stopped by Decapitron and the other puppets, who force him back to the elevator shaft. With the cabin already gone and the door secretly opened by Pinhead, Jennings falls to his death.\n\nSutekh corners Rick and Suzie, but Decapitron shows up, allowing them to escape. The puppets engage Sutekh, who fights back; but having stayed too long in the mortal world, the demon's essence has become vulnerable, and his power wanes. In desperation, Sutekh attempts to escape back into the underworld by opening a portal, but Decapitron fires [[electron]] bolts at it, overloading the conduit and causing it to explode, destroying Sutekh.\n\nRick takes the puppets back home to repair and care for them. Toulon speaks with Rick one final time, again entrusting his puppets and their secret to him while they will continue to act as his protectors.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Guy Rolfe]] as [[Andre Toulon|Andr\u00e9 Toulon]]\n* [[Gordon Currie (actor)|Gordon Currie]] as Rick Myers\n* [[Chandra West]] as Susie\n* [[Ian Ogilvy]] as Jennings\n* Teresa Hill as Lauren\n* [[Nicholas Guest]] as Tom Hendy\n* [[Willard E.

But in 2007, Full Moon reacquired the rights to the first five films, and the set has since been re-released. However, more recently the first six films of the franchise have been available as part of the budget-priced Midnight Horror Collection released by Echo Bridge Entertainment; parts 1, 2 and 3 on one double-sided DVD, and parts 4, 5 and 6 on a separately sold double-sided disc.\n\n==Timeline issue==\n* In [[Puppet Master 4]], it confirms Andr\u00e9 Toulon's time of death as March 15, somewhere between 1943 and 1945. However, in this film, Rick Meyers tells Dr. Jennings that Andr\u00e9 Toulon died shortly AFTER World War II ended, which was April 1945. If Toulon's day and month of death remains the same, Andr\u00e9 Toulon killing himself on March 15, 1946 would NOT be shortly after WWII ended. However, since this is the only contradiction, it's best speculated that Rick Meyers just misspoke, and possibly meant March 15, 1945 shortly BEFORE World War II ended. More on this in [[Retro Puppet Master|Retro]] and [[Puppet Master: Axis of Evil|Axis of Evil]].\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe fact of having no soundtrack of this movie, is because some used songs are from the [[Puppet Master 4|previous film]], ''[[Meridian: Kiss of the Beast|Meridian]]'' and ''[[Robot Wars (film)|Robot Wars]]''.\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0110916}}\n* {{Amg movie|134507}}\n\n{{Puppet Master}}\n{{Jeff Burr}}\n\n[[Category:1994 films]]\n[[Category:1994 horror films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jeff Burr]]\n[[Category:American supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:Puppet films]]\n[[Category:Puppet Master (film series)]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Richard Band]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
