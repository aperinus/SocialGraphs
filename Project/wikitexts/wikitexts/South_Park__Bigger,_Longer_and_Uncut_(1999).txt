The film was directed by series creator [[Trey Parker]] from a screenplay by Parker, series co-creator [[Matt Stone]], and [[Pam Brady]]; and stars Parker, Stone, [[Mary Kay Bergman]], and [[Isaac Hayes]], all of whom reprise their roles from the series, with [[George Clooney]], [[Eric Idle]], and [[Mike Judge]] in supporting roles. The plot follows [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] as they sneak into an [[Motion Picture Association film rating system#Ratings|R-rated]] film starring the Canadian comedy duo [[List of supporting characters on South Park#Terrance and Phillip|Terrance and Phillip]], after which they begin [[profanity|swearing]]. When the consequent [[moral panic]] culminates in the United States declaring war on Canada, Stan, Kyle and Cartman take it upon themselves to save Terrance and Phillip from execution, while Kenny tries to prevent a [[prophecy]] involving [[Satan (South Park)|Satan]] and [[Saddam Hussein (South Park)|Saddam Hussein]]'s intent to conquer the world.\n\nPrimarily centered on themes of censorship and scapegoating, the film also parodies and satirizes the animated films of the [[Disney Renaissance]], musicals such as ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'', and [[South Park controversies|controversies]] surrounding the series itself. The film also heavily satirizes the [[Motion Picture Association|Motion Picture Association of America]]; during production, Parker and Stone disputed with the MPAA, which returned the film multiple times with an NC-17 rating due to its use of profanity. The film's songs were written by Parker and [[Marc Shaiman]], the latter of whom composed the [[Film score|score]].\n\n''South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut'' premiered at [[Grauman's Chinese Theater]] on June 23, 1999, and was released theatrically in North America the following week by [[Paramount Pictures]], with [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] handling international distribution. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, soundtrack, humor and themes. Produced on a $21&nbsp;million budget, it grossed $83.1&nbsp;million worldwide, making it the [[List of highest-grossing R-rated films|highest-grossing R-rated animated film]] until 2016. At the [[72nd Academy Awards]], the song \"[[Blame Canada]]\" was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]], but lost to [[Phil Collins]]' \"[[You'll Be in My Heart]]\" from ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nOne morning in South Park, [[Colorado]], [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]] and his adopted brother [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]], [[Eric Cartman]], and [[Kenny McCormick]] visit the movie theater to see [[Terrance and Phillip]]'s new film, ''Asses of Fire''. When they are denied tickets to the [[Motion Picture Association film rating system#MPA film ratings|R-rated]] film, the boys pay a homeless man to accompany them. After watching the film, the boys begin [[profanity|swearing]] constantly. Their friends are impressed and also decide to see the film, except for [[Wendy Testaburger]], who becomes acquainted with transfer student Gregory, to Stan's jealousy.\n\nWhen the children's parents find out, they are forbidden from seeing the film again, but do so multiple times. As a bet with Cartman, Kenny [[Fart lighting|sets his fart on fire]], imitating a scene from the film; he accidentally immolates himself and is rushed to the hospital, where he dies from a botched [[heart transplantation|heart transplant]]. Barred from [[Heaven]], Kenny descends into [[Hell]], wherein he encounters [[Satan (South Park)|Satan]] and his abusive partner [[Saddam Hussein]]. Meanwhile, Kyle's mother, [[Gerald and Sheila Broflovski|Sheila]], forms the Mothers Against Canada (M.A.C.) movement with other parents. Terrance and Phillip are arrested as [[War crime|war criminals]]; when the United States refuses to release them, Canada bombs the [[Baldwin family|Baldwins]] in retaliation. The US declares war on Canada and arranges to have Terrance and Phillip [[capital punishment|executed]] during a [[United Service Organizations|USO]] show. After insulting Sheila, Cartman is implanted with a [[V-chip]], which administers an electric shock whenever he swears.\n\nSatan prophesies that the war is a sign of the [[apocalypse]] and upon Terrance and Phillip's deaths, he will invade and conquer Earth. After failing to persuade Satan to abandon Saddam, Kenny's ghost visits Cartman to warn him. Unable to reason with their mothers, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman form a [[resistance movement]] with their classmates to rescue Terrance and Phillip. At Gregory's behest, they recruit the French-accented, [[misotheism|misotheistic]] Cristophe, nicknamed \"the Mole.\" Kyle later hides Ike in their family's attic as Canadians are sent to [[internment|internment camps]]. After they infiltrate the show, Stan and Kyle are tasked with stalling the execution, while Cartman attempts to deactivate the alarm as the Mole prepares to secure Terrance and Phillip. However, Kenny's ghost reappears before Cartman, frightening him into forgetting his task. The Mole is discovered and fatally mauled by guard dogs.\n\nThe remaining boys try to warn their mothers about Satan's prophecy, but are ignored as the execution commences. The execution is interrupted when the [[Canadian Army]] launches a [[military deception|surprise attack]], resulting in a massive battle between the two armies. Cartman deactivates the electrical switch, allowing Terrance and Phillip to escape; the shock from the switch causes his V-chip to malfunction. Stan chases after them, but is knocked out in an explosion. Members of M.A.C., horrified at what they incited, decide to abandon their cause, with only Sheila remaining committed.\n\nStan reawakens before a sentient [[clitoris]], who tells him to be self-confident to gain Wendy's affection. Stan leads the others to Terrance and Phillip, whom the [[United States Army|US Army]] have cornered. The children form a [[human shield]] as Kyle tries to reason with Sheila, faulting her for scapegoating others for his mistakes. While the soldiers begin to back down, Sheila refuses and shoots Terrance and Phillip dead, fulfilling Satan's prophecy. Saddam usurps Satan and demands that everyone bow to him. When Saddam insults Cartman, the latter's retort releases bolts of energy from his hands. Subsequently, Cartman engages in profanity-laden tirades to attack Saddam, who continues to verbally abuse Satan. Satan becomes enraged and throws Saddam back into Hell, where he is impaled on a stalagmite.\n\nGrateful for Kenny's support, Satan grants him one wish. Kenny wishes for everything to return to a pre-war state, and parts with his friends before disappearing. South Park is restored as the casualties, including Terrance and Phillip, are undone. As Americans and Canadians make peace, Sheila reconciles with Kyle, as does Wendy with Stan. For his sacrifice, Kenny is allowed entry into Heaven.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = \n| image1 = George Clooney 2016.jpg\n| width1 = 148\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = [[George Clooney]] voices <br />Dr. Gouache.\n| image2 = Brent Spiner by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| width2 = 151\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = [[Brent Spiner]] provides the voice of [[Conan O'Brien]].\n| image3 = Eric Idle.jpg\n| width3 = 152\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = [[Eric Idle]] of [[Monty Python]] fame provides the voice of Dr. Vosknocker.\n| image4 = Mike Judge by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| width4 = 152\n| alt4 = \n| caption4 = [[Mike Judge]], creator of ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'' and ''[[King of the Hill]]'', voiced [[Kenny McCormick]] unhooded in the film.\n| footer = \n}}\n\n{{Main|List of South Park characters}}\n* [[Trey Parker]] as [[Stan Marsh]] / [[Eric Cartman]] / Gregory / [[Satan (South Park)|Satan]] / [[Mr. Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] / Mr. Hat / Phillip Niles Argyle / [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy Marsh]] / [[Clyde Donovan]] / Tom \u2013 News Reporter / Midget in a Bikini / [[Bill Clinton]] / Canadian Ambassador / Bombardiers / [[Mr. Mackey]] / Army General / Ned Gerblansky / Christophe \u2013 Ze Mole (or The Mole) / Big Gay Al (singing voice) / [[Adolf Hitler]] / additional voices\n* [[Matt Stone]] as [[Kyle Broflovski]] / [[Kenny McCormick]] (Hooded) / [[Saddam Hussein]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Saddam Hussein |url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/South-Park/Saddam-Hussein/ |website=Behind the Voice Actors |access-date=December 29, 2018}}</ref> (credited to \"Himself\") / Terrance Henry Stoot / Big Gay Al / Ticket Taker / Stuart McCormick / Jimbo Kearn / [[Gerald and Sheila Broflovski|Gerald Broflovski]] / [[Butters Stotch]] / American Ambassador / additional voices\n* [[Mary Kay Bergman]] as Liane Cartman / Sheila Broflovski / Sharon Marsh / Carol McCormick / Wendy Testaburger / Clitoris / additional voices\n* [[Isaac Hayes]] as [[Chef (South Park)|Chef Jerome McElroy]]\n* Jesse Howell, Anthony Cross-Thomas and Franchesca Clifford as [[Ike Broflovski]] (Franchesca Clifford was credited as \"Francesca Clifford\")\n* Bruce Howell as Man in Theatre\n* [[Deb Adair]] as Woman in Theatre\n* [[Jennifer Howell]] as Bebe Stevens\n* [[George Clooney]] as Dr. Gouache (\"Dr. Doctor\" on screen)\n* [[Brent Spiner]] as [[Conan O'Brien]]\n* [[Minnie Driver]] as [[Brooke Shields]]\n* [[Dave Foley]] as the [[Baldwin brothers]]\n* [[Eric Idle]] as Dr. Vosknocker\n* [[Nick Rhodes]] as Canadian Fighter Pilot\n* [[Toddy Walters|Toddy E.
