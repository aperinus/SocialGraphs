Stevens is disoriented, as his last memory was of flying a mission in [[Afghanistan]]. However, to the world around him \u2013 including his friend Christina Warren and his reflection in the train's windows and mirrors \u2013 he appears to be a different man: a school teacher named Sean Fentress. As he expresses his confusion to Christina, the train explodes while passing by another train, killing everyone aboard.\n\nStevens abruptly awakens in a dimly lit cockpit. Communicating through a video screen, [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] Captain Colleen Goodwin verifies Stevens' identity and tells him of his mission to find the train bomber before sending him back to the moment he awoke on the train. Believing he is being tested in a simulation, Stevens finds the bomb in a vent inside the lavatory but is unable to identify the bomber. Still thinking he\u2019s in a simulation, Stevens leaves the bomb and goes back down to the main cabin before the train explodes again.\n\nStevens again reawakens in his capsule and after demanding to be briefed, learns that the train explosion actually happened and that it was merely the first attack of a suspected series. He is sent back yet again, eight minutes before the explosion, to identify the bomber. This time, he disembarks the train (with Christina) to follow a suspect. This turns out to be a dead end, the train still explodes in the distance, and Stevens is killed by a passing train after falling onto the tracks while interrogating a suspect.\n\nThe capsule power supply malfunctions as Stevens reawakens. He claims to have saved Christina, but Dr. Rutledge tells him that she was saved only inside the \"Source Code\". Rutledge explains that the Source Code is an experimental machine that reconstructs the past using the dead passengers' residual collective memories of eight minutes before their deaths. Therefore, the only thing that matters is finding the bomber to prevent the coming second attack in Chicago.\n\nOn his next run-in, Stevens learns that he was reported as killed in action two months earlier. He confronts Goodwin, who reveals that he is missing most of his body and is on life support and hooked up to neural sensors. The capsule and his healthy body are \"manifestations\" made by his mind to make sense of the environment. Stevens is angry at this forced imprisonment. Rutledge offers to [[Assisted suicide|terminate]] Stevens after the mission, and Stevens eventually accepts.\n\nAfter numerous attempts, including being arrested by the train security for trying to obtain a weapon, Stevens identifies the bomber through a fallen wallet, a nihilistic domestic terrorist named Derek Frost. Stevens memorizes Frost's license and vehicle registration plates. He discovers a [[dirty bomb]] built inside a van owned by Frost, as Christina follows him and both are shot dead by Frost. Outside Source Code, he relays his knowledge to Goodwin, which helps the police arrest Frost and prevents the second attack. Stevens is congratulated for completing his mission. Rutledge secretly reneges on his deal to let Stevens die, as he is still the only candidate who can enter Source Code.\n\nBeing more sympathetic to his plight, Goodwin sends Stevens back one last time and promises to disconnect his life support after eight minutes. This time, he sets a date with Christina, defuses the bomb, apprehends Frost, and reports him to the police. He calls his father under the guise of a fellow soldier and reconciles with him, and sends Goodwin an email. After eight minutes, Goodwin terminates Stevens' life support.\n\nAs the world around him continues to progress beyond eight minutes, Stevens confirms his suspicion that Source Code is not merely a simulation, but rather a machine that allows him to create alternate timelines. He and Christina leave the train and go on a date. In the same (alternate) reality, Goodwin receives Stevens' message. He tells her of Source Code's true capability and asks her to help the alternate-reality version of him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as Captain Colter Stevens\n* [[Michelle Monaghan]] as Christina Warren\n* [[Vera Farmiga]] as Captain Colleen Goodwin\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as Dr. Rutledge\n* [[Michael Arden]] as Derek Frost\n* [[Russell Peters]] as Max Denoff\n* [[Scott Bakula]] as Donald Stevens, Colter's father \n* Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick De Grandpr\u00e9 as Sean Fentress \n* [[Cas Anvar]] as Hazmi\n\n==Production==\n\n===Preproduction===\n[[David Hahn]], the boy depicted in the 2003 made-for-television documentary ''The Nuclear Boy Scout'', was the inspiration for the antagonist Derek Frost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ca.io9.com/5788795/duncan-jones-unravels-the-mysteries-behind-source-code |title=Duncan Jones tells us what really happened at the end of ''Source Code'' |website=[[io9]] |access-date=May 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813005823/http://ca.io9.com/5788795/duncan-jones-unravels-the-mysteries-behind-source-code |archive-date=August 13, 2011}}</ref> In an article published by the [[Writers Guild of America]], screenwriter [[Ben Ripley]] is described as providing the original pitch to the studios responsible for producing ''Source Code'':<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=4583 |title=Practice Makes Perfect |website=[[Writers Guild of America]] |access-date=June 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015102641/http://wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=4583 |archive-date=October 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|Ripley first came up with the idea for ''Source Code'', in which government operative Colter Stevens repeatedly relives the eight minutes leading up to a terrorist train bombing in hopes of finding the bomber, he had no intention of writing it on spec.
