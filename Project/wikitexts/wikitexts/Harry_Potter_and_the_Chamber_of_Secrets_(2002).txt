Pictures]], based on [[J. K. Rowling]]'s [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|1998 novel of the same name]]. The film, which is the second instalment in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]], was written by [[Steve Kloves]], and produced by [[David Heyman]]. The film stars [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (Character)|Harry Potter]], with [[Rupert Grint]] and [[Emma Watson]] as his best friends [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] respectively. The story follows Harry's second year at [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], where the Heir of [[Salazar Slytherin]] opens the [[Chamber of Secrets]], unleashing a monster that [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrifies]] the school's students. The film is the sequel to ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone]]'' (2001).\n\nPrincipal photography began in November 2001, only three days after the release of the first film. The filming concluded in July 2002, and the film had a budget of $100 million. ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' premiered in [[London]] on 3 November 2002, and was released theatrically in the United Kingdom and the United States on 15 November 2002.\n\nThe film became a critical and commercial success, grossing $879 million worldwide and becoming the [[2002 in film#Highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film of 2002]], behind ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''. It was praised for its darker plot, sets and a story appropriate for a young audience. This film has the longest runtime in the series. It was nominated for many awards, including the [[BAFTA Award for Best Production Design]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Sound|Best Sound]], and [[BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects|Best Special Visual Effects]]. It was followed by ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' (2004).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films are set between 400-700 words. This article also uses British English, so be sure to see WP:ENGVAR before inverting certain grammar, like \"defence\" for example. -->\nSpending the summer with [[the Dursleys]], [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] meets [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|Dobby]], a [[house-elf]] who warns him that it is dangerous to return to [[Hogwarts]]. Dobby sabotages an important dinner for the Dursleys, who lock up Harry to prevent his return to Hogwarts. Harry's friend [[Ron Weasley]] and his brothers [[Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] rescue him in [[Arthur Weasley|their father]]'s [[Arthur Weasley's flying Ford Anglia|flying Ford Anglia]].\n\nIn [[Diagon alley|Diagon Alley]], Harry and the Weasley family are joined by [[Hermione Granger]] at a book-signing by [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], Hogwarts' new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher. Confronted by [[Draco Malfoy]], Harry notices Malfoy's father, [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]], slip a book into [[Ginny Weasley]]'s cauldron. When Harry and Ron are blocked from entering [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters]] at [[London King's Cross railway station]], they take the flying car to Hogwarts; after crashing into the [[Whomping Willow]] breaking Ron's wand, they receive detention.\n\nIn detention, Harry hears a strange voice and later finds caretaker [[Argus Filch]]'s cat, Mrs Norris, [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrified]] beside a message written in blood: \"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened, enemies of the heir... beware.\" [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] explains that one of Hogwarts' founders, [[Salazar Slytherin]], supposedly constructed a secret Chamber containing a monster that only his heir can control, capable of purging the school of [[Muggle-born]] students. Suspecting that Malfoy is the heir, Harry, Ron, and Hermione plan to question him while disguised, using forbidden [[polyjuice potion]], which they brew in a disused bathroom haunted by a ghost called [[Moaning Myrtle]].\n\nDuring a [[Quidditch]] game, Harry's arm is broken by a rogue [[Bludger (Quidditch)|Bludger]]. Dobby visits him in the infirmary and reveals that he closed the barrier to  Platform Nine and Three-Quarters  and made the Bludger chase Harry to force him to leave the school. He also reveals that the Chamber had been opened in the past. When Harry [[Parseltongue|communicates with a snake]], the school believes he is the heir. Disguised as two of Malfoy\u2019s friends, Harry and Ron learn he is not the heir, but come to know that his father had told him that a Muggle-born girl died when the Chamber was last opened. Harry finds an enchanted diary owned by former student [[Tom Riddle]], who opened the Chamber and blamed [[Rubeus Hagrid]], leading to his expulsion. When the diary is stolen and Hermione is petrified, Harry and Ron question Hagrid. [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], Minister of Magic [[Cornelius Fudge]], and Lucius arrive to take Hagrid to [[Azkaban]], but he discreetly tells the boys to \"follow the spiders\". In the [[Forbidden Forest (Harry Potter)|Forbidden Forest]], Harry and Ron meet Hagrid's giant pet spider, [[Aragog]], who reveals Hagrid's innocence and provides a clue about the Chamber's monster.\n\nA book page in Hermione's hand identifies the monster as a [[Basilisk (Harry Potter)|basilisk]], a giant serpent that kills people who make direct eye contact with it; the petrified victims only saw it indirectly. The school staff learns Ginny has been taken into the Chamber, and nominate Lockhart to save her. Harry and Ron find Lockhart preparing to flee, exposing him as a fraud. Deducing that Myrtle was the Muggle-born girl that the basilisk killed, they find the Chamber's entrance in the bathroom she haunts. Once inside, Lockhart tries to stop Harry and Ron by using a memory charm, but because he seized Ron's broken wand, the spell backfires, erasing Lockhart's memory and causing a cave-in which separates Harry from Ron and Lockhart.\n\nHarry enters the Chamber alone and finds Ginny unconscious, guarded by Riddle. Riddle reveals that he used the diary to manipulate Ginny into reopening the Chamber, and that he is Slytherin's heir and Voldemort's younger self. After Harry expresses his loyalty to Dumbledore, the latter's pet [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] [[Fawkes (Harry Potter)|Fawkes]] arrives with the [[Sorting Hat]], causing Riddle to summon the basilisk. Fawkes blinds the basilisk, and the Sorting Hat produces the [[Sword of Gryffindor]], with which Harry battles the basilisk. After a struggle, he kills it but is poisoned by one of its fangs.\n\nDespite his injury, Harry stabs the diary with the basilisk fang, destroying Riddle and reviving Ginny. Fawkes' tears heal Harry, and he returns to Hogwarts with his friends and a baffled Lockhart, earning Dumbledore's praise and Hagrid's release. Harry accuses Lucius, Dobby's master, of planting the diary in Ginny's cauldron, and tricks him into freeing Dobby. The basilisk's victims are healed, Hermione reunites with Harry and Ron, and Hagrid is released from Azkaban.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further|List of Harry Potter cast members}}\n<!--Per billing block-->\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]: A 12-year-old British [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] famous for surviving his parents' murder at the hands of the evil wizard [[Lord Voldemort]] as an infant, who now enters his second year at [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name=\"CastBBC\" />\n* [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Ron Weasley]]: Harry's best friend at Hogwarts and one of the youngest members of the Weasley family.<ref name=\"CastBBC\" />\n* [[Emma Watson]] as [[Hermione Granger]]: Harry's other best friend and the trio's brains.<ref name=\"CastBBC\" />\n* [[Kenneth Branagh]] as [[Gilderoy Lockhart]]: A celebrity author and the new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher at Hogwarts.<ref name=\"BranaghNewsround\" /> [[Hugh Grant]] was the first choice for the role to play Lockhart,<ref name=\"GrantGuardian\" /> but due to reported scheduling conflicts he was unable to play the character.<ref name=\"GrantGuardian2\" /> [[Alan Cumming]] was also considered, but withdrew due to salary disputes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alan Cumming told Harry Potter producers to 'f*** off' when offered role of Gilderoy Lockhart.
