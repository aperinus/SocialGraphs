Eight years after Terrier has retired from mercenary work, he and the people close to him become the targets of hit squads sent by a powerful multinational security firm, and he must fight to stay alive. The film was released on March 20, 2015 by [[Open Road Films]]. It was a [[box office bomb]], grossing just $24 million against its $40 million budget and receiving a poor critical reception.\n\n==Plot==\nAmerican Jim Terrier is a former [[United States Army Special Forces|Special Forces]] soldier who has become a [[black-ops]] mercenary. He is part of a team deployed by a corporation in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] in 2006, under the cover of providing security to local projects. He falls in love with Annie, a fellow expat working as an NGO doctor in a local hospital. During this period, even though civil war has wreaked havoc on the country, large multinational mining companies continue to profit from the country's mining industry. After the Minister of Mining announces his plans to declare contracts with the mining companies unjust and renegotiate the terms, the mining companies hire Terrier's team to assassinate the Minister to ensure their access to the rich mineral resources. Terrier delivers the fatal shot from a [[sniper rifle]] and flees from Africa, leaving Annie behind. After that, Terrier retires from his mercenary career.\n\nEight years later he returns to DRC as a charity worker to build wells. One day Terrier is brutally assaulted by a local hit squad, but he manages to kill them all. While searching the attackers' bodies, he finds signs that the attack was not random and that he was the target. Scared and suspicious, Terrier flees to London to meet an ex-mercenary colleague, who reveals that Cox, their ex-boss in the Congo assassination, has formed a large international security firm offering its services to major clients, such as [[the Pentagon]]. The firm's head wants to eliminate all of the former members of the assassination squad as revelations of their former activities could hinder the development of the new firm. Now the firm's hit teams chase Terrier around the clock, meanwhile killing his friends and kidnapping Annie.\n\nHowever, Terrier still keeps highly compromising materials that can reveal Cox's role in the Congo assassination and uses it to lure Cox and his team to a [[Spanish-style bullfighting|bullfight in Spain]], threatening to expose their complicity unless they trade Annie for the evidence. Unknown to them, Terrier makes a deal with Interpol to provide evidence to aid their ongoing investigation. Despite battling [[amyloid plaque|severe head trauma]] suffered from his violent past, Terrier defeats the experienced mercenaries sent to kill him. As he struggles to help Annie escape to safety, Cox discovers them. Terrier is wounded but manages to shoot Cox, who is then gored by a loose bull. Interpol officers arrive and take Terrier into custody, though Agent Barnes promises to do what he can to help Terrier avoid doing more jail time than necessary.\n\nThe film ends with Terrier, recovered and released from prison, reuniting with Annie in the DRC.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Penn]] as Jim Terrier\n* [[Javier Bardem]] as Felix Marti\n* [[Idris Elba]] as Jackie Barnes\n* [[Mark Rylance]] as Terrance Cox\n* [[Jasmine Trinca]] as Annie\n* [[Ray Winstone]] as Stanley\n* [[Peter Franz\u00e9n]] as Reiniger\n* Billy Billingham as Reed\n* Daniel Adegboyega as Bryson\n* Ade Oyefeso as Eugene\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nCirca January 2013, French action director [[Pierre Morel]] (''[[Taken (film)|Taken]]'') entered negotiations to direct [[Sean Penn]] in ''Prone Gunman'', an action thriller being produced by [[Silver Pictures]]\u2019 [[Joel Silver]] and Andrew Rona.
