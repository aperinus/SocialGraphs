The film stars [[Harvey Keitel]] as the titular \"bad [[Lieutenant#Police rank|lieutenant]]\" as well as [[Victor Argo]] and [[Paul Calder\u00f3n]].\n\nThe screenplay was co-written by Ferrara with actress-model [[Zo\u00eb Tamerlis Lund|Zo\u00eb Lund]], both of whom appear in the film.\n\nThe film was screened in the ''[[Un Certain Regard]]'' section at the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nAfter dropping off his two young sons at Catholic school, an unnamed [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] police lieutenant ([[Harvey Keitel]]) uses [[cocaine]] and drives to the scene of a double homicide in [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]]. The Lieutenant finds a drug dealer and gives him a bag of drugs from a crime scene, smoking [[crack cocaine|crack]] during the exchange; the dealer promises to give him the money he makes from selling the drugs in a few days. At an apartment, the Lieutenant gets drunk and engages in a [[threesome]] with two women. Meanwhile, a nun ([[Frankie Thorn]]) is raped inside a church by two young [[hoodlum]]s.\n\nThe next morning, the Lieutenant learns that he has lost a bet on a [[National League Championship Series]] game between the [[New York Mets]] and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. He tries to win back his money by doubling his wager on the Dodgers in the next game. At another crime scene, the Lieutenant rifles through the car and finds some drugs which he stashes in his suit jacket. However, he is too impaired to secure the drugs, and they fall out onto the street in front of his colleagues. The Lieutenant tries to play it off by instructing them to enter the drugs into evidence.\n\nAt the hospital, the Lieutenant spies on the nun's examination, and learns that she was penetrated with a [[crucifix]]. Later that evening, he pulls over two teenage girls who are using their father's car without his knowledge to go to a club. As they have no driving license, the Lieutenant tells one of the girls to bend over and pull up her skirt (Eddie Daniels), and the other ([[Bianca Hunter]]) to simulate [[oral sex]] while he [[masturbation|masturbate]]s. The following day, he listens in on the nun's confession to her priest, where she says she knows who assaulted her but will not identify them.\n\nWhile drinking vodka and snorting cocaine while driving through [[Times Square]], the Lieutenant listens to the final moments of the Dodgers game and shoots out his car stereo when they lose. Despite being unable to pay the $30,000 wager, he doubles his bet for the next game. Eavesdropping on the nun's [[Sacrament of Penance|confession]], he hears her state that she has no anger about what happened and begins cursing at God before breaking down in tears and sobbing that he wants to redeem himself. The Lieutenant drinks in a bar when the Dodgers lose again. After scoring cocaine in a nightclub, he tries to double his bet yet again. His friend refuses to make the wager, insisting that the [[bookie]] would kill him.\n\nThe Lieutenant picks up his $30,000 share from the drug dealer and calls the bookie personally to place his bet. They arrange to meet in front of [[Madison Square Garden]]. He then visits a woman ([[Zo\u00eb Lund]]) and does [[heroin]] with her. At the church, he tells the nun that he will exact vengeance upon her attackers, but she repeats that she has forgiven them and leaves. In the resulting emotional breakdown, the Lieutenant sees an apparition of [[Jesus]] and tearfully curses him before begging forgiveness for his crimes and sins. The figure is revealed to be a woman holding a golden chalice, which turns out to have been [[pawnshop|pawned]] at her husband's shop.\n\nWith the help of the woman, the Lieutenant tracks the two rapists to a nearby crack den in [[Spanish Harlem]] and cuffs them together. He holds them at gunpoint and smokes crack with them as the Mets win the pennant. Instead of taking them to the station, he drives them to the [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]] and puts them on a bus with a cigar box containing the $30,000. He demands that they never come back to New York. After he leaves the terminal, he parks on the street in front of [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]]. Another car drives up beside him, and the driver, presumably the bookie with whom the Lieutenant had arranged to meet, shoots and kills the Lieutenant.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as The Lieutenant\n* [[Victor Argo]] as Bet Cop\n* [[Paul Calder\u00f3n]] as Cop #1\n* Eddie Daniels as Jersey Girl - Passenger\n* [[Bianca Hunter]] (credited as Bianca Bakija) as Jersey Girl - Driver\n* [[Zo\u00eb Tamerlis Lund|Zo\u00eb Lund]] as Zoe\n* [[Vincent Laresca]] as J.C.\n* [[Frankie Thorn]] as The Nun\n* Fernando V\u00e9l\u00e9z as Julio\n* Joseph Micheal Cruz as Paulo\n* [[Paul Hipp]] as [[Jesus]]\n* [[Frank Adonis]] as Large\n* Anthony Ruggiero as Lite\n* Victoria Bastel as Bowtay\n}}\n\n==Production==\nAccording to Zo\u00eb Lund:\n<blockquote>There was a lot of rewriting done on the set. Two other characters were cut, and my character modulated and took on more and more. A lot of things had to be changed and improvised. The vampire speech \u2013 which is crucial to the Lieutenant \u2013 was written two minutes before it was shot. I memorized it and did it in one take. The speech is important because she is acute in knowing the journey the Lieutenant makes. She shoots him up, sends him off, knowing of his passion, she lets him go.<ref name=interview>{{Cite web |url=http://dantenet.com/er/chats/interviews/zoe/zoe.html |title=Zoe Tamerlis Lund interview |access-date=June 30, 2015 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060805/http://dantenet.com/er/chats/interviews/zoe/zoe.html |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nLund avowed in an interview that she \"co-directed\" several scenes in the film.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POb1Ge5z634#t=12 Zoe Tamerlis on drugs and sex in \"Bad Lieutenant\"]</ref> Lund also claimed that she wrote the screenplay of ''Bad Lieutenant'' alone and believed that Ferrara did not put much effort in his contributions in the film.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g68u0cARNjk Zoe Tamerlis on the script of \"Bad Lieutenant\"]</ref><ref name=wr>{{cite web|last=Rubinstein|first=Raphael|title=MISSING FOOTAGE|date=September 2014|work=[[The White Review]]|url=http://www.thewhitereview.org/features/missing-footage/|access-date=30 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Jonas Mekas]], Lund's ex-boyfriend [[Edouard de Laurot]] was reported to have written most of the film's script.<ref name=wr/> [[David Scott Milton]] later vouched for this claim.<ref name=milton>{{cite web|last=Milton|first=David Scott|title=Edouard de Laurot, Film Genius and Lunatic|date=13 September 2014|url=http://www.dsmilton.com/2014/09/edouard-de-laurot-film-genius-lunatic/|access-date=30 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040000/http://www.dsmilton.com/2014/09/edouard-de-laurot-film-genius-lunatic/|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Mekas even claimed he had \"scribbles and notes to prove it\".<ref>[http://www.webofstories.com/play/jonas.mekas/50;jsessionid=D70154EB77FEE517A237BEFA3043154F Edouard De Laurot]</ref>\n\nFerrara said in 2012 that he was using drugs during the making of the film: <blockquote>The director of that film needed to be using, the director and the writer\u2014not the actors.<ref>{{cite web|last=Walker|first=Luke|title=Breaking Bad: The Second Coming of Abel Ferrara|date=15 March 2012|url=http://www.thefix.com/content/abel-ferrara-dsk-addiction7476|access-date=18 April 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Special Edition DVD from Lion's Gate has a special feature about the pre-, during, and post-production of the film, in which Ferrara explains the screenplay's genesis, its authorship, and its original brevity.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n[[Christopher Walken]] was originally going to portray the titular character.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=Abel Ferrara interview: Driller Killer, Bad Lieutenant, Body Snatchers|date=24 November 2016|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/driller-killer/45449/abel-ferrara-interview-driller-killer-bad-lieutenant-body-snatchers|access-date=23 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Alternate versions==\nOriginally rated [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#X replaced by NC-17|NC-17]] and one of the few films to be rated thus on the basis of depictions of drug use and violence (the only other film being ''[[Comfortably Numb (film)|Comfortably Numb]]''), the unedited cut's rating was described as being for \"sexual violence, strong sexual situations and dialogue, graphic drug use\".\n\n[[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster]] and [[Hollywood Video]], the largest video rental companies in the United States, had a policy prohibiting the purchase and rental of NC-17 films.
