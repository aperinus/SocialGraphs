The sequel to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977),{{EpIV}} it is the second film in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series and the fifth chronological chapter of the \"[[Skywalker Saga]]\". Set three years after the events of ''Star Wars'', the film recounts the battle between the malevolent [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], led by the [[Palpatine|Emperor]], and the [[Rebel Alliance]], led by [[Princess Leia]]. [[Luke Skywalker]] trains to master [[the Force]] so he can confront the powerful [[Sith]] lord, [[Darth Vader]]. The [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Mark Hamill]], [[Harrison Ford]], [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Billy Dee Williams]], [[Anthony Daniels]], [[David Prowse]], [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]], [[Peter Mayhew]], and [[Frank Oz]].\n\nFollowing the success of ''Star Wars'', Lucas hired Brackett to write the sequel. After she died in 1978, he outlined the whole ''Star Wars'' saga and wrote the next draft himself, before hiring ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981) writer Kasdan to enhance his work. To avoid the stress he faced directing ''Star Wars'', Lucas handed the responsibility to Kershner and focused on expanding his special effects company [[Industrial Light & Magic]] instead. Filmed from March to September 1979 in [[Finse]], Norway, and at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] in England, ''The Empire Strikes Back'' faced production difficulties, including actor injuries, illnesses, fires, and problems securing additional financing as costs rose. Initially budgeted at $8{{nbsp}}million, costs had risen to $30.5{{nbsp}}million by the project's conclusion.\n\nReleased on May 21, 1980, the highly anticipated sequel became the [[1980 in film|highest-grossing film that year]], earning approximately $401.5{{nbsp}}million worldwide. Unlike its predecessor, ''Empire'' met with mixed reviews from critics, and fans were conflicted about its darker and maturer themes than those of the lighthearted adventure ''Star Wars''. Critics praised the expressive features and characterization of puppeteered character [[Yoda]], a diminutive alien who serves as Luke's teacher. The film was nominated for various awards and won [[53rd Academy Awards|two Academy Awards]], [[23rd Annual Grammy Awards|two Grammy Awards]], and [[34th British Academy Film Awards|a BAFTA]], among others. Subsequent releases have raised the film's worldwide gross to $538\u2013549{{nbsp}}million and, adjusted for inflation, it is the [[List of highest-grossing films in Canada and the United States|13th-highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada]].\n\nSince its release, ''The Empire Strikes Back'' has been critically reassessed and is now often regarded as the best film in the ''Star Wars'' series and among the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]]. It has had a significant impact on filmmaking and popular culture and is often considered an example of a sequel superior to its predecessor. The climax,<!-- Do not remove per WP:SPOILER --> in which Vader reveals he is Luke's father,<!-- Do not remove per WP:SPOILER --> is often ranked as one of the greatest [[plot twist]]s in cinema. The film spawned a variety of merchandise and adaptations, including video games and a radio play. The United States [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 2010. ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983) followed ''Empire'', concluding the [[Star Wars original trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]]. [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|Prequel]] and [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogies]] that round out the \"Skywalker saga\" have since been released.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nThree years after the destruction of the [[Death Star]],{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', also known as ''Episode&nbsp;IV{{snd}}A New Hope'' (1977).}} the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] fleet, led by [[Darth Vader]], dispatches [[Probe Droid]]s across the galaxy to find [[Princess Leia]]'s [[Rebel Alliance]], with one probe locating the rebel base on the ice planet [[Hoth]]. A [[wampa]] captures [[Luke Skywalker]] before he can investigate the probe, but he escapes by using [[the Force]] to retrieve his [[lightsaber]] and wound the beast. Before succumbing to [[hypothermia]], the [[Force spirit]] of Luke's deceased mentor, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], instructs him to go to the swamp planet [[Dagobah]] to train as a [[Jedi#Knight|Jedi Knight]] under the [[Jedi Master]] [[Yoda]]. [[Han Solo]] discovers Luke and insulates him against the weather inside his deceased [[tauntaun]] mount until they are rescued the next morning.\n\nAlerted to the Rebels' location, the Empire launches a large-scale attack using [[AT-AT walker]]s to capture the base, forcing the Rebels to evacuate. Han and Leia escape with {{nowrap|[[C-3PO]]}} and [[Chewbacca]] aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', but the ship's [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperdrive]] malfunctions. They hide in an [[Asteroid family|asteroid field]], where Han and Leia grow closer amid the tension. Vader summons several bounty hunters, including [[Boba Fett]], to find the ''Falcon''. Evading the Imperial fleet, Han's group travels to the floating Cloud City on the planet [[Bespin]], which is governed by his old friend [[Lando Calrissian]]. Fett tracks them there and Vader forces Lando to surrender the group to the Empire, knowing Luke will come to their aid.\n\nMeanwhile, Luke travels with {{nowrap|[[R2-D2]]}} in his [[X-wing fighter]] to Dagobah, where he crash-lands. He meets Yoda, a diminutive creature who reluctantly accepts him as his Jedi apprentice after conferring with Obi-Wan's spirit. Yoda trains Luke to master the light side of the Force and resist negative emotions that will seduce him to the [[dark side of the Force|dark side]], as they did Vader. Luke struggles to control his anger and impulsiveness and fails to comprehend the nature and power of the Force until he witnesses Yoda use it to telekinetically lift the X-wing from the swamp. Luke has a premonition of Han and Leia in pain and, despite Obi-Wan's and Yoda's protestations, abandons his training to rescue them. Although Obi-Wan believes Luke is their only hope, Yoda asserts that \"there is another.\"\n\nLeia confesses her love for Han before Vader freezes him in [[carbonite (Star Wars)|carbonite]] to test whether the process will safely imprison Luke. Han survives and is given to Fett, who intends to collect his bounty from [[Jabba the Hutt]]. Lando frees Leia and Chewbacca, but they are too late to stop Fett's escape. The group fights its way back to the ''Falcon'' and flees the city. Luke arrives and engages Vader in a lightsaber duel over the city's central air shaft. Vader overwhelms Luke, severing his right hand and separating him from his lightsaber. He urges Luke to embrace the dark side and help him destroy his master, [[Emperor Palpatine|the Emperor]], so they may rule the galaxy together. Luke refuses, citing Obi-Wan's claim that Vader killed his father, prompting Vader to reveal that he is Luke's father. Desperate, Luke drops into the air shaft and is ejected beneath the floating city, latching onto an antenna. He reaches out through the Force to Leia, and the ''Falcon'' returns to rescue him. [[TIE fighter]]s pursue the group, which is almost captured by Vader's [[Star Destroyer]] until {{nowrap|R2-D2}} reactivates the ''Falcon''{{'}}s hyperdrive, allowing them to escape.\n\nAboard the Rebel fleet, a [[Technology in Star Wars#Prosthetics|robotic prosthesis]] replaces Luke's hand. He, Leia, {{nowrap|C-3PO}}, and {{nowrap|R2-D2}} observe as Lando and Chewbacca depart on the ''Falcon'' to find Han.{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983)}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Star Wars characters|List of Star Wars cast members}}\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 420\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = right\n| footer = Left to right: [[Mark Hamill]] (pictured in 2019), [[Harrison Ford]] (2017), and [[Carrie Fisher]] (2013)\n| image1 = Mark Hamill (48419236062) Cropped.jpg\n| alt1 = A photograph of Mark Hamill\n| image2 = Harrison Ford by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| alt2 = A photograph of Harrison Ford\n| image3 = Carrie Fisher 2013 cropped retouched.jpg\n| alt3 = A photograph of Carrie Fisher\n}}\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as Luke Skywalker: A pilot in the Rebel Alliance and apprentice Jedi<ref name=\"CastWiredLuke\"/>\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as Han Solo: A smuggler and captain of the ''Millennium Falcon''<ref name=\"CastBBCHan\"/><ref name=\"CastQuartzHan\"/>\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] as Leia Organa: A leader in the Rebel Alliance<ref name=\"QuartzPrincessLeia\"/>\n* [[Billy Dee Williams]] as Lando Calrissian: The administrator of Cloud City<ref name=\"VarietyWilliams\"/>\n* [[Anthony Daniels]] as {{nowrap|C-3PO}}: A humanoid protocol droid<ref name=\"CastSmithsonC3PO\"/>\n* [[David Prowse]] / [[James Earl Jones]] (voice) as Darth Vader: A powerful Sith Lord<ref name=\"CastVarietyVader\"/><ref name=\"CastInverseVader\"/>\n* [[Peter Mayhew]] as Chewbacca: Han's loyal [[Wookiee]] friend and co-pilot<ref name=\"CastReutersChewie\"/><ref name=\"CastEWChewie\"/>\n* [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]] as R2-D2: An astromech droid<ref name=\"CastEmpireR2D2\"/>\n* [[Frank Oz]] (puppeteer/voice) as Yoda: A diminutive, centuries-old Jedi Master<ref name=\"EmpireMakingOf\"/><ref name=\"GRadarOthers\"/>\n\nThe film also features [[Alec Guinness]] as Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi,<!--Credited as--> and [[John Hollis]] portrays Lobot, Lando's aide.<ref name=\"BFICast\"/> The Rebel force includes [[General Rieekan]] (portrayed by [[Bruce Boa]]),<ref name=\"BFICast\"/> [[Major Derlin]] ([[John Ratzenberger]]),<ref name=\"DeadlineCheers\"/><ref name=\"StarWarsRatzenberger\"/> Cal Alder (Jack McKenzie),<ref name=\"StarWarsRatzenberger\"/> Dak Ralter ([[John Morton (actor)|John Morton]]),<ref name=\"StarWarsRatzenberger\"/><ref name=\"BusinessInsiderDak\"/> [[Wedge Antilles]] ([[Denis Lawson]]),<ref name=\"BFICast\"/> Zev Senesca ([[Christopher Malcolm]]),<ref name=\"TheRegisterZev\"/><ref name=\"ArsTechicaZev\"/> and [[Hobbie Klivian]] ([[Richard Oldfield]]).<ref name=\"EWHobbie\"/>\n\nThe Empire's forces include [[Admiral Piett]] ([[Kenneth Colley]]), [[Admiral Ozzel]] ([[Michael Sheard]]), [[General Veers]] ([[Julian Glover]]), and [[Captain Needa]] ([[Michael Culver]]).<ref name=\"BFICast\"/> The Emperor<!-- Do not add \"Sidious\" or \"Palpatine\" as he is not referred to by these names in this film.--> is voiced by [[Clive Revill]] and portrayed physically by Elaine Baker.<ref name=\"I09YodaMonkey\"/>{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=308}} Other cast includes [[Jeremy Bulloch]] as the bounty hunter Boba Fett (voiced by [[Jason Wingreen]], who remained uncredited until 2000);<ref name=\"BFICast\"/><ref name=\"NMEWingreen\"/> other bounty hunters include Dengar (portrayed by Morris Bush) and humanoid lizard Bossk (Alan Harris).<ref name=\"SyFyBossk\"/><ref name=\"DOGDengar\"/>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{see also|Industrial Light & Magic#History|Skywalker Ranch|l1=History of Industrial Light & Magic|l2=Founding of Skywalker Ranch}}\n[[File:George Walton Lucas.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=George Lucas sporting white hair and a short beard looking at the camera|Creator [[George Lucas]] (in 2011).

Film critic Tim Robey wrote that much of ''Empire''{{'}}s imagery and narrative can be connected to the 1975 film ''[[Dersu Uzala (1975 film)|Dersu Uzala]]'', directed by [[Akira Kurosawa]]\u2014whose work inspired Lucas.<ref name=\"TelegraphThemes\"/><ref name=\"BFIKurosawa\"/> Muren described the Empire's assault on Hoth with AT-AT vehicles as an analogy for the [[Vietnam War]], specifically an invading military employing equipment inappropriate for the local terrain.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=55}}\n\nClarke identified Luke as the heir to mythological heroes, such as [[Prometheus]], [[Jason]], and [[Galahad]]. He is guided initially by a traditional aide, Obi-Wan, who offers the promise of destiny until he is replaced by Yoda.{{sfn|ClarkeB|1980|p=66}} Anne Lancashire wrote that the Yoda narrative is a traditional mythological tale in which the hero is trained by a wise old master and must abandon all his preconceived notions.{{sfn|Lancashire|1981|p=40}} Clarke described [[hero's journey|Luke's journey]] as the hero who ventures into the unknown to be tested by his own dark impulses but eventually overcomes them. He believed this represented the human ability to control irrational impulsiveness to serve love, order, and justice.{{sfn|ClarkeB|1980|p=66}}\n\nLucas wanted Yoda to be a traditional fairy-tale or mythological character, akin to a frog or an unassuming old man, to instill a message about respecting everyone and not judging on appearance alone, because he believed that would lead the hero to succeed.<ref name=\"ObserverYoda\"/> ''[[The New York Observer]]''{{'}}s Brandon Katz described Yoda as deepening the Force through philosophy. Yoda says they are all luminous beings beyond just flesh and matter, and presents the Jedi as [[Zen]] warriors who work in harmony with the Force. Kasdan described them as enlightened warrior priests, similar to [[Samurai]].{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=344}}<ref name=\"ObserverYoda\"/>\n\n===Religion===\nIn developing the Force, Lucas said he wanted it to represent the core essence of multiple religions unified by their common traits. Primarily, he designed it with the intent that there is good, evil, and a god. Lucas's personal faith includes a [[theism|belief in God]] and basic morality, such as treating others fairly and not taking another's life. ''The Presbyterian Journal'' described the film's religious message as closer to [[Eastern religions]] such as [[Zoroastrianism]] or [[Buddhism]] than [[Judeo-Christian]], presenting [[good and evil]] as abstract concepts. Similarly, God or the Force is an impersonal entity, taking no [[divine providence|direct action]]. ''[[Christianity Today]]'' said that the film's drama is caused by the absence of a righteous god or being creating a direct influence.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=344}}\n\nLancashire and J. W. Rinzler described Luke's journey as based purely on Christianity, focused on destiny and [[free will]], with Luke serving as a [[Jesus|Christ]]-like figure and Vader as a [[fallen angel]] attempting to lure him toward evil.{{sfn|Lancashire|1981|pp=41,44}}{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=344}} Kershner said any religious symbolism was unintentional, as he wanted to focus on the power of an individual's untapped potential instead of magic.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=344}}\n\n===Duality and evil===\nAnne Lancashire contrasted the first ''Star Wars'' film's message of idealism, heroics, and friendship with the more complex tone of ''Empire''.{{sfn|Lancashire|1981|p=39}} The latter challenges the former's notions, primarily because Luke loses his innocence in coming to perceive people as neither entirely good nor evil.<ref name=\"StarWarsThemes\"/>{{sfn|Lancashire|1981|pp=40,42}} The scene in which Luke enters the dark side cave on Dagobah represents where his anger will lead him and forces him to move beyond his belief that he is completely on the light side of the Force.{{sfn|ClarkeB|1980|p=66}}{{sfn|Lancashire|1981|p=40}} Kershner said the cave tests Luke against his greatest fear, but because the fear is in his mind, and he brought his weapon with him, it creates a scenario where he is forced to use it.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=258}} After defeating the avatar of Vader, the mask splits open to reveal Luke's face, suggesting he will succumb to the temptations of the dark side unless he learns patience and to abandon his anger.{{sfn|Lancashire|1981|pp=40\u201341}}\n\nThe darkness is similarly presented in Han, a self-interested smuggler struggling with his growing feelings for Leia and the responsibility associated with her cause. The film represents his two sides in Leia and Lando, a representative of his smuggler life.{{sfn|Lancashire|1981|pp=43\u201344}} ''Empire'' questions the cost of friendship. Where ''Star Wars'' presents traditional friendship, ''Empire'' presents friendship as requiring sacrifice. Han sacrifices himself in the frigid cold of Hoth to save Luke's life.<ref name=\"StarWarsThemes\"/>{{sfn|Lancashire|1981|p=42}} Similarly, Luke abandons his Jedi training, something he has longed for, to rescue his friends. This can be seen as a selfish choice, as he does so against Yoda and Obi-Wan's instructions, potentially sacrificing himself for his friends instead of training to defeat the Empire, a cause his friends support.<ref name=\"StarWarsThemes\"/>{{sfn|Lancashire|1981|p=42}} According to Lancashire, characters are shown to be heroic through sacrificing for others instead of fighting battles.{{sfn|Lancashire|1981|p=48}}\n\nLancashire believed that Luke's impatience to leave for Bespin exemplifies his lack of growth from his training.{{sfn|Lancashire|1981|pp=40\u201341}} There, Vader tempts him with the power of the dark side and the revelation that he is Luke's father.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=344}}{{sfn|ClarkeB|1980|p=66}} Vader wants Luke's help to destroy the Emperor, not for good, but so that Vader can impose his own order over the galaxy.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=344}} This admission robs Luke of the idealized image of his Jedi father, reveals Obi-Wan's deception in hiding his parentage, and takes the last of his innocence.<ref name=\"StarWarsThemes\"/><ref name=\"StarWarsThemes2\"/><ref name=\"ScreenRantThemesObi\"/> Gerald Clarke suggests Luke is not strong or virtuous enough to resist Vader during this confrontation, and so allows himself to fall into the airshaft below, showing the antagonist does sometimes win.{{sfn|ClarkeB|1980|p=66}}<ref name=\"StarWarsThemes\"/> The concept of a character having a good father and an evil father is a common story trope because of its simple representations of good and evil.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=344}} At the film's finale, Luke has a greater understanding of the relationship between good and evil, and the [[dualism in cosmology|dual nature]] of people.{{sfn|Lancashire|1981|p=41}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===Critical reassessment===\n''The Empire Strikes Back'' remains an enduringly popular piece of cinema.<ref name=\"SyFy40Years\"/> It is considered

This defied the contemporary popular trend of exploiting a popular film by creating low-budget sequels to diminishing returns, as in the ''[[Jaws (franchise)|Jaws franchise]]''.<ref name=\"Escapist\"/><ref name=\"LandonPalmer\"/><ref name=\"NerdistBlockbuster\"/> Instead, more was spent on ''Empire'' to expand the fictional universe and reap greater box-office returns. The cliffhanger ending, setting up a future sequel, is seen in many modern films, particularly those in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<ref name=\"Escapist\"/> It has also been suggested that ''Empire'' forged a narrative structure that continues to be emulated in trilogies, where the middle film will be darker than the original and typically feature an ending in which the protagonists fail to defeat the antagonists, leading into a subsequent film. Emmet Asher-Perrin and Ben Sherlock cite the series ''[[Back to the Future (franchise)|Back to the Future]]'', ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' as examples.<ref name=\"TOR\"/><ref name=\"ScreenRantInspo\"/>\n\nFilmmakers such as the [[Russo brothers]], [[Roland Emmerich]], and [[Kevin Feige]] cite it as an inspiration in their careers or identify as fans.<ref name=\"ColliderRusso\"/><ref name=\"EmpireEmmerich\"/><ref name=\"ColliderFeige\"/>\n\n==Sequels, prequels, and adaptations==\n{{main|Return of the Jedi|Star Wars prequel trilogy|Star Wars sequel trilogy}}\nThe film was adapted into a [[Star Wars (radio)|1982 radio play]] broadcast on [[NPR|National Public Radio]] in the U.S.<ref name=\"NYTimesRadioDrama\"/> ''The Empire Strikes Back'' was followed by ''Return of the Jedi'' in 1983, concluding the original film trilogy.

Like the previous films, ''Jedi'' was a financial success and fared well with critics.<ref name=\"DOGROTJ\"/><ref name=\"EpisodeVIBFI\"/>\n\nNearly two decades after the release of ''Empire'', Lucas wrote and directed the [[prequel trilogy]], consisting of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'' (1999), ''Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones'' (2002), and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005).
