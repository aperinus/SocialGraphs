Most of the school scenes were shot at [[Westdale Secondary School]] in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\n==Plot==\nWoody Deane ([[Kevin Zegers]]) and Nell Bedworth ([[Samaire Armstrong]]) are neighbors and former childhood friends who go to the same high school, but are otherwise completely different. Woody is a popular varsity [[American football|football]] player while Nell is a girl who loves literature but lacks social skills. They loathe each other and are constantly in dispute. One day their class goes on a school trip to a museum and they are forced to work together on an assignment. They quickly begin arguing in front of a statue of the ancient [[Aztec]] god [[Tezcatlipoca]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realmovienews.com/reviews/discs/1459 |title=It's A Boy Girl Thing DVD Review |publisher=Realmovienews.com |date=2007-05-21 |access-date=2012-01-02}}</ref> As they argue, the statue casts a spell upon them\u2014causing them to wake up in each other's bodies the next morning. When they arrive at school, they immediately blame each other for the body swap, but agree to pretend to be the other person until they can find a way to switch back. At first, they seem to succeed, but quickly return to arguing when they each feel the other is misrepresenting them in the opposite body, such as Woody (in Nell's body) answering a question oddly and surprising a teacher.\n\nThe following day, Nell (in Woody's body) arrives at school wearing \"[[Chino cloth|Chinos]] and an [[Oxford (cloth)|Oxford]] cotton button-down\" making Woody's appearance look \"dorky\" which frustrates Woody, and he is even more frustrated after he hears about how Nell (in Woody's body) failed Woody's football practice the previous day. As payback, Woody (in Nell's body) dresses in inappropriate and provocative clothing the following day. After school, Nell, in retaliation, breaks up with Breanna ([[Brooke D'Orsay]]), Woody's girlfriend, much to the disappointment of Woody. The humiliation competition continues when Woody (in Nell's body) drives off with a biker boy, Nicky (Brandon Carrera), and makes Nell think she is going to lose her [[virginity]]. However, Woody decides it is \"so gay\" and leaves Nicky just as he is removing his clothing.\n\nThe following day, rumors are being spread around school by Nicky about his night with Nell. When Nell finds out, she gets very upset. When Woody finds Nell, he admits that he didn't actually lose Nell's virginity and that everyone was simply spreading Nicky's lies. However, Nell is still let down and so Woody decides to confront Nicky. It turns out that Woody (in Nell's body) can't fight him, and Nell (in Woody's body) runs up and punches him in the face. After this, Nell and Woody reach a truce and realize the statue of Tezcatlipoca at the museum had something to do with their body swap. They head down to the museum and even after confronting the statue, they fail to return to their original bodies. They realize they are going to have to help each other in two important upcoming events. Nell must learn how to play football for Woody's [[Homecoming]] game and Woody must learn about poetry and literature for Nell's [[Yale University|Yale]] interview. Later that night Nell (in Woody's body) is getting drunk at a party while Woody (in Nell's body) is stuck at a slumber party listening to all the gossip about himself, and is surrounded by nail polish, pajamas, slippers, and gets a bikini wax.\n\nAfter spending so much time together, Nell and Woody become very fond of each other and start to understand each other better. The night before the interview and the game, they agree to go to the Homecoming Dance together, as \"not a date.\" The day of the interview and match, Woody goes to Yale for the interview and at first messes things up and is asked to leave, but he starts to talk about poetry in [[Hip hop music|rap]], which impresses and astonishes the interviewer. After that, he goes to the football game and watches Nell run in the winning [[touchdown]] in the closing seconds. A college recruiter witnesses his good performance and wants to talk to him later. After the game, they congratulate each other for their successes. Shortly after this, the spell lifts and they return to their original bodies. The scene finishes with Woody being kissed by Breanna and Nell going home very upset about it.\n\nThe following day, Woody tries to talk to Nell, but is stopped by her mother, who sees Woody's family as uneducated. Nell receives an acceptance letter from Yale, meaning that her interview (done by Woody in her body) was successful; however, she is still upset with Woody and decides not to go to the Homecoming Dance. Meanwhile, Nell's father has a talk with her on the porch about Woody, during which she confesses she truly likes him, and her father surprises her with a dress and shoes for the dance. Woody and Breanna are selected as the Homecoming King and Queen. As the Homecoming King and Queen prepare to dance, an upset Woody sees Nell and both confess their love for each other. They leave the school together and share a kiss in front of their houses. The following day, Nell tells her mother that she is taking a year's [[sabbatical]] before attending  Yale, and hops into Woody's car as they drive off together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Samaire Armstrong]] as Nell Bedworth<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00k7b6d/Its_a_Boy_Girl_Thing/ |title=BBC iPlayer - It's a Boy Girl Thing |publisher=BBC.co.uk |access-date=2012-01-02}}{{subscription required}}{{expired link|date=September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=It's a Boy Girl Thing Movie Script|url=https://www.scripts.com/script/it%27s_a_boy_girl_thing_11045|access-date=2020-07-11|website=www.scripts.com }}</ref>\n* [[Kevin Zegers]] as Woody Deane\n* [[Maury Chaykin]] as Stan Deane\n* [[Robert Joy]] as Ted Bedworth\n* [[Sherry Miller]] as Katherine Bedworth\n* [[Sharon Osbourne]] as Della Deane\n* [[Mpho Koaho]] as Harry 'Horse' Horson\n* [[Brooke D'Orsay]] as Breanna Bailey\n* [[Genelle Williams]] as Tiffany\n* [[Emily Hampshire]] as Chanel\n* Dan Warry-Smith as Team Guy #1\n* [[Alex Nussbaum]] as Mr. Zbornak\n* [[Jack Duffy]] as Old Man\n* [[John Bregar]] as Richard\n* David Ndaba as Team Guy #2\n* [[Rob Ramsay|Robert James Ramsay]] as Team Guy #3\n}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe movie's soundtrack features a range of music.
