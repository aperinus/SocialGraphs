Tired of taking care of him, the G7 decide he should get married within a year. The problem is Luis does not want any kind of serious relationship since they ruined his first true love. After turning down all the girls introduced to him, he gets an idea: \"rent\" his best friend's sister, Emma ([[Charlotte Gainsbourg]]), turn her into the perfect bride-to-be, and make her not show up on their wedding day. That way, Luis thinks his family will leave him alone. Unfortunately for him, his family likes Emma and blames him when she apparently jilts him at the altar. He then comes up with an alternate plan to have Emma act horribly towards his family so they will not like her anymore. The two begin to fall in love so Luis finally stands up to his family, confesses his schemes and finally settles down with Emma.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alain Chabat]] - Luis Costa\n* [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]] - Emma\n* [[Bernadette Lafont]] - Genevi\u00e8ve Costa\n* [[Wladimir Yordanoff]] - Francis Bertoff \n* [[Gr\u00e9goire Oestermann]] - Pierre-Yves\n* [[V\u00e9ronique Barrault]] - Catherine \n* [[Marie-Armelle Deguy]] - Axelle\n* [[A\u00efssa Ma\u00efga]] - Kirsten Hansen\n* [[Katia Lewkowicz]] - Carole\n* [[Louise Monot]] - Maxine\n* [[Anne Marivin]] - Sales Associate\n* [[\u00c9ric Lartigau]] - A passerby\n\n==Production==\nAlain Chabat originally came up with the idea for the film and planned to produce the film and write the script.
