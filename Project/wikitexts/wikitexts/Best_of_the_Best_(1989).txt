The film also starred [[Eric Roberts]], [[James Earl Jones]], [[Sally Kirkland]], Simon Rhee and [[Chris Penn]].\n\nThe plot revolves around a team of American martial artists facing a team of [[South Korea]]n martial artists in a martial arts tournament.<ref>{{cite news|title= MOVIE REVIEW Plot Defeats 'Best' Karate Sequences |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1989-11-10|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1989-11-10/entertainment/ca-1191_1_phillip-rhee|access-date=2011-01-13|first=Kevin|last=Thomas}}</ref> Several subplots pop up in the story \u2014 moral conflicts, the power of the human spirit triumphing over adversity and the meaning of life are some themes.\n\nSet and filmed in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], between February 13 and April 6, 1989, ''Best of the Best'' was released on November 10, 1989.\n\nThe film has spawned three sequels: ''[[Best of the Best 2]]'' (1993), ''[[Best of the Best 3: No Turning Back]]'' (1995), and ''[[Best of the Best 4: Without Warning]]'' (1998). Phillip Rhee portrays Tommy Lee in all four films, produced all of them, directed the third and fourth films, and co-wrote the first and fourth films.\n\n==Plot==\nAlexander Grady, a widower and father from [[Portland, Oregon]] is chosen to represent the United States of America in an international martial arts tournament against Team [[Korean Republic|Korea]]. Once a rising star in the martial arts world, he suffered a shoulder injury that forced him into retirement. Also chosen for the team are Tommy Lee, a highly skilled martial arts instructor from [[Fresno, California]]; Travis Brickley, an extremely brash fighter with a short fuse from [[Miami, Florida]]; Virgil Keller, a devout [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] from [[Providence, Rhode Island]]; and Sonny Grasso, a streetwise fighter from [[Detroit, Michigan]]. Despite being coached by veteran trainer Frank Couzo, their chances of winning are virtually non-existent, as the Koreans train all year long, enjoy full financial support from their nation, and have\u2014on at least one occasion\u2014killed a competitor in the ring. To win, they will need to be the best technically, physically, and mentally.\n\nAs training begins, the team struggles to bond as Travis antagonizes them. Given the pressure, the American team hires a second assistant coach, Catherine Wade, whose spiritual approach to training clashes with Couzo's more rigorous coaching techniques. Tommy is disturbed when his opponent is revealed to be Dae Han Park, Team Korea's best fighter and veteran martial artist who was responsible for killing Tommy's brother David Lee in a similar tournament. Couzo hopes that Tommy's desire for revenge will give him the necessary aggression to win, while Wade is more concerned about Tommy's mental state. With time and training, the team begins to bond and to earn each other's respect.\n\nCouzo cuts Alex from the team when he breaks the rigid training regimen to visit his son, who had been hit by a car; later, Tommy quits after knocking out Virgil with a powerful spinning side kick during practice. Conflicted by his desire for revenge, Tommy confesses to Alex his fear of fighting Dae Han, but Alex strongly urges him to do the right thing and face his brother's killer. Travis and the others persuade Couzo to reinstate Alex, and Tommy eventually rejoins the team after a change of heart.\n\nIn the first two matches of the tournament, Sonny and Virgil are out-classed by their Korean opponents Yung Kim and Han Cho. Travis does his best to psyche up the team with his brash attitude, going point for point with his Korean counterpart Tung Sung Moon, but gets beaten in a tie-breaker brick-breaking competition. Alex dominates his match with his opponent, Sae Jin Kwon, but takes a devastating axe-kick to his shoulder which dislocates it. Instead of giving up, he implores Tommy to \"pop\" the shoulder back into place and resumes the fight, ultimately defeating his opponent with one arm and winning the match. Finally, Tommy faces Dae Han. After a slow start, Tommy gets the upper hand and delivers a series of blows that forces Dae Han solely on the defensive. As the match nears its end, Tommy has brought the American team within two points of outright victory, and Dae Han can barely stand. Tommy prepares to finish the fight, but knowing that Dae Han would not survive the attack, his coaches and teammates dissuade him. Tommy hesitates and lets the clock run out, saving the man's life but forfeiting the overall victory. Couzo consoles Tommy afterwards, telling him, \"You won that match. Don't ever forget that\".\n\nAt the medal ceremony, Dae Han unexpectedly approaches Tommy and praises him for his honorable act. He tearfully apologizes for the death of Tommy's brother, and in return offers himself as a brother. Tommy accepts, and Dae Han places his medal around Tommy's neck before the two men embrace. Sae Jin Kwon then walks up to Alex and states his long-time admiration for him as a fighter, before also handing over his medal. The other members of Team Korea then follow suit, awarding their medals to their respective American opponents.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eric Roberts]] as Alex Grady\n* [[James Earl Jones]] as Coach Frank Couzo\n* [[Phillip Rhee]] as Tommy Lee\n* [[Chris Penn]] as Travis Brickley\n* [[John Dye]] as Virgil Keller\n* David Agresta as Sonny Grasso\n* [[Tom Everett]] as Assistant Coach Don Peterson\n* [[Sally Kirkland]] as Catherine Wade\n* [[John P.
