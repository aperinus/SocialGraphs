It was planned, produced and primarily animated by [[Studio 4\u00b0C]] and adapted and [[Film director|directed]] by [[Masaaki Yuasa]] in his directorial debut, with chief [[Animation director|animation direction]] and [[model sheet]]s by Y\u016bichir\u014d Sueyoshi, [[Art director|art direction]] by T\u014dru Hishiyama and groundwork and further animation direction by Masahiko Kubo.\n\nIt is unusual among features other than [[anthology film]]s in using a series of disparate visual styles to tell one continuous story. As Yuasa commented in a ''[[Japan Times]]'' interview, \"Instead of telling it serious and straight, I went for a look that was a bit wild and patchy. I think that Japanese animation fans today don't necessarily demand something that's so polished. You can throw different styles at them and they can still usually enjoy it.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Director has whale of a time making experimental 'Mind Game'|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2004/07/28/films/film-reviews/director-has-whale-of-a-time-making-experimental-mind-game/#.VmxsoDzhAnU|last=Schilling|first=Mark|date=28 July 2004|newspaper=[[The Japan Times]]|access-date=12 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=''Mind Game'': Anime for the 21st century|url=http://www.kfccinema.com/features/interviews/tanaka_mindgame/tanaka_mindgame.html|last=Leong|first=David|date=1 July 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223143923/http://www.kfccinema.com/features/interviews/tanaka_mindgame/tanaka_mindgame.html|archive-date=23 February 2009|publisher=KFCC}}</ref>\n\nThe film received a cult audience and was well received, winning multiple awards worldwide, and has been praised by directors [[Satoshi Kon]]<ref>{{cite web | title=Interview with Satoshi Kon | url=http://www.gamestar.com/11_04/pause/pause_disc_satoshikon.shtml | publisher=Gamestar | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104062002/http://www.gamestar.com/11_04/pause/pause_disc_satoshikon.shtml | archive-date=4 January 2011 | quote=GS: Have you seen any films lately that you found great?

One late evening he runs into his childhood crush, Myon, on the subway. She tells Nishi she is due to marry. They go to her father's [[yakitori]] restaurant, and see Myon's father and her elder sister Yan (who runs the restaurant). Nishi also meets Myon's fianc\u00e9e, Ryo. Two yakuza gangsters enter, Atsu and a senior yakuza whom Atsu calls Aniki (literally 'brother', a term used by Yakuza to refer to each other). They are looking for Myon's father who hid under the table when the gangsters walked in. Atsu is after him as he had seduced and stole Atsu's girlfriend.\n\nAs Atsu threatens Myon with a gun, Ryo steps in and tries to punch Atsu, but instead gets knocked out. Atsu then prepares to rape Myon, who calls out Nishi's name. Atsu turns on Nishi, who is rolled in a ball, terrified, placing his pistol against Nishi's anus. Atsu fires when Nishi finally musters the courage to yell, \"I will hurt you!\", thus killing him instantly. The senior Yakuza, offended by Atsu's lack of control, shoots him dead.\n\nMeanwhile, Nishi is in some sort of [[limbo]] where he encounters a being whose physical image changes every fraction of a second, ''Kami-sama'' (God). ''Kami-sama'' directs Nishi to walk into a red portal where he will disappear, but at the last moment Nishi runs for the opposite blue portal in order to return to life. ''Kami-sama'' becomes impressed by Nishi's sheer will to live, and so lets him escape.\n\nNishi returns to the moment just before Atsu pulled the trigger. This time, Nishi seizes Atsu's gun with his buttocks, and shoots him dead. He, Yan and Myon all pile into the yakuza's car, leaving the father and Ryo (still unconscious) behind. They speed off, followed by the massed yakuzas. The Yakuza boss calls Nishi using the yakuza's car phone and threatens to frame the three for armed robbery and murder. Then after further chase the boss has his men force the trio in to a dead end on a bridge. However, Nishi steers the car off the bridge and they are swallowed up by an enormous whale.\n \nInside the whale, they meet an old man who was formerly yakuza and has been trapped in the whale for more than 30 years. He shows them to the elaborate suspended house he has constructed over the 'sea' inside the whale's belly. Nishi attempts to escape the whale but he fails and they resign themselves to life inside the whale. Yan practices dancing and art, Myon practices swimming (a dream she gave up when her breasts got bigger), Nishi practices writing and drawing humorous manga and he and Myon finally become sexually intimate.\n\nThey attempt to leave the whale, again failing. The old man reveals that the water level inside the whale is rising, and he believes the whale is probably dying. They concoct a plan to make a motor boat using spare parts and fuel from the car they arrived in. On the day before the final match of the soccer World Cup, the whale returns to Osaka (their home town) and Yan, Nishi, and Myon, as well as the Old Man, manage to escape.\n\nAs the four fly through the air, the film returns to its very first scene, with Myon running from the Yakuza, only this time she does not get her leg caught in the door of the train, and the Yakuza is left behind on the platform. This is followed by a lengthy montage, similar to that of the opening credits, showing the histories of the various characters. The movie ends ambiguously, with the phrase \"This Story Has Never Ended\" appearing before the credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n'''Voice cast'''\n* [[Koji Imada]] as Nishi\n* Sayaka Maeda as Myon\n* [[Takashi Fujii]] as Old man (''jiisan'')\n* Seiko Takuma as Yan\n* [[Tomomitsu Yamaguchi]] as Ry\u014d\n* Toshio Sakata as Father of Myon and Yan (''Myon to Yan no chichi'')\n* J\u014dji Shimaki as [[Yakuza]] boss (''yakuza no bosu'')\n* Ken'ichi Ch\u016bj\u014d as Atsu (yakuza member)\n* [[Rintar\u014d Nishi]] as Senior yakuza member (''Aniki''. lit. \"brother\".
