Clucher) and produced by [[Italo Zingarelli]]. The film stars [[Terence Hill]] and [[Bud Spencer]] as two brothers, Trinity and Bambino, who help defend a Mormon settlement from Mexican bandits and the henchman of the land-grabbing Major Harriman. It was filmed on location in [[Lazio]], [[Italy]], with financial backing from West Film.\n\nThe sequel, ''[[Trinity Is Still My Name]]'', was even more successful than ''They Call Me Trinity''.{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=239}} In 1995, ''[[Sons of Trinity]]'', starring [[Heath Kizzier]] and [[Keith Neubert]],  was released as a continuation of the Trinity series.\n\n==Plot==\nTrinity, a lazy, [[ne'er-do-well]] [[gunfighter]] with unnaturally fast drawing ability and [[marksmanship]], is dragged on a [[travois]] by his horse to a way station and restaurant. There, he encounters a pair of bounty hunters with an injured Mexican prisoner. Trinity calmly takes the Mexican away from the two men, killing them before they can shoot him in the back. The pair reach a small town, where they witness the local sheriff, a large, burly man with a similarly fast drawing ability to Trinity, gunning down three men after they harass him for not allowing one of their criminal friends to be released.\n\nIt becomes apparent that Trinity and the man, Bambino, are brothers. Bambino is merely posing as the new [[sheriff]] of the small town while he awaits the arrival of his gang from the penitentiary from which he escaped, following a run-in with the actual sheriff who incidentally took the same way as Bambino on his way to his new post. Bambino is not happy to see his trouble-making brother. However, the two form a temporary partnership to deal with Major Harriman, who is attempting to run a group of pacifist [[Mormon]] farmers off their land with the intention of using their property to graze his own horses. The fact that these horses are valuable and unbranded explains Bambino's grudging willingness to work with his little brother, even though he considers Trinity to be a shiftless bum without ambition.\n\nHowever, Trinity has fallen in love with two Mormon sisters and is genuinely concerned with the Mormon settlers' welfare. He persuades Bambino and Bambino's henchmen to help train the pacifistic Mormons to fight, and in the final battle, the Mormon leader finds in the [[Book of Ecclesiastes]] in the Bible that \"there is a time for fighting,\" and the Mormons are unleashed against Major Harriman's goons, using the dirty fighting tricks that they have just learned.\n\nBambino is flabbergasted and infuriated to learn that Trinity has given the Major's horses to the Mormons. Trinity is about to be happily married to the two Mormon sisters when he learns that being a married Mormon means actually having to work, causing him to hurry after Bambino, who angrily sends him off in the opposite direction. After Bambino departs for California, the real sheriff appears, and Trinity points him in Bambino's direction. Trinity then reclines in his travois and brings up the rear with his horse, following them all.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Lo chiamavano Trinit\u00e0.png|thumb|[[Bud Spencer]] as Bambino and [[Terence Hill]] as Trinity]]\n{{div col}}\n*[[Terence Hill]] as Trinity, \"The Right Hand of the Devil\"\n*[[Bud Spencer]] as Bambino, \"The Left Hand of the Devil\"\n*[[Farley Granger]] as Major Harriman\n*[[Steffen Zacharias]] as Jonathan\n*{{Interlanguage link multi|Dan Sturkie|de}} as Tobias\n*[[Gisela Hahn]] as Sarah\n*{{Interlanguage link multi|Elena Pedemonte|de}} as Judith\n*[[Ezio Marano]] as Weasel\n*[[Luciano Rossi]] as Timid\n*{{Interlanguage link multi|Michele Cimarosa|it}} as Drunken Mexican\n*[[Ugo Sasso]] as crippled Sheriff \n*[[Remo Capitani]] as Mezcal\n*[[Riccardo Pizzuti]] as Jeff\n*{{Interlanguage link multi|Paolo Magalotti|it}} as Harriman Henchman\n*{{Interlanguage link multi|Antonio Monselesan|it}} as Bounty Hunter\n*Gaetano Imbr\u00f2 as Blond Bounty Hunter\n*[[Luigi Bonos|Gigi Bonos]] as Ozgur, the Bartender\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nDirector [[Enzo Barboni]] wrote the original story and screenplay for the film.{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=231}} Initially, the script only included the Trinity character and not Bambino but producer [[Italo Zingarelli]] suggested the inclusion of a brother.{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=231}} When the film was first announced, [[Peter Martell]] was set to play Trinity and [[George Eastman (actor)|George Eastman]] Bambino.{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=232}} The two characters were later portrayed by [[Terence Hill]] and [[Bud Spencer]], who were then a [[Terence Hill and Bud Spencer|popular comic duo]] following the release of [[Western (genre)|Western]] film ''[[God Forgives... I Don't!]]'' in October 1967 in Italy, where they were cast as comedic and violent characters.{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=230}} Hill and Spencer did their own stunts in the film with the rest of the supporting cast being portrayed predominantly by stuntmen.{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=236}}\n\nInteriors and the towns in the film were shot at Incir De Paolis Studios in Rome.{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=229}}{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=232}} The stage station was shot at [[Magliana quarry]] in [[Lazio]], while the valley locations were shot at [[Parco Dei Monti Simbruini]]. {{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=232}}{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=233}} The waterfall scene was shot at Treja Valley Park.{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=232}}{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=233}}\n\nThe main title song was written by [[Franco Micalizzi]] and [[Lally Stott]].{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=237}}{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=238}} It is sung by David King, who is billed as \"Annibale\" on Italian soundtrack releases.{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=238}} \u201cTrinity: Titoli\u201d was later used as the closing theme for [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s 2012 Western ''[[Django Unchained]]''.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8aelDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA3285 |title=The Encyclopedia of Best Films: A Century of All the Finest Movies, V-Z |first=Jay Robert |last=Nash |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] |date=1 November 2019 |page=3285 |isbn=9781538134191}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''They Call Me Trinity'' was released just before Christmas in 1970 in Italy.{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=232}}{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=238}} The film was popular abroad, such as in Spain where it outgrossed all previous Italian Westerns except ''[[For A Few Dollars More]]''.{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=238}} It proved foundational for all future German dubs of films starring Hill and Spencer: the main dialogue was rewritten to be more humorous, with parts of the film silent in the original receiving additional dialogue from characters standing with their back to the camera. The film was released in the United States and United Kingdom in 1971.{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=238}} As of 2004, ''They Call Me Trinity'' was the 22nd most successful Italian film, one position below ''[[The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly]]''.{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=239}}\n\nFollowing the popularity of the film, derivative films were released such as ''[[Two Sons of Trinity]]'' and the ''Carambola'' series which featured Hill and Spencer lookalikes [[Michael Coby]] and [[Paul L.
