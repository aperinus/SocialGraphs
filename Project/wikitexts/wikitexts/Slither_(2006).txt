Produced by [[Paul Brooks]] and [[Eric Newman (producer)|Eric Newman]], the film stars [[Nathan Fillion]], [[Elizabeth Banks]], [[Tania Saulnier]], [[Gregg Henry]], and [[Michael Rooker]]. The film is set in a small town in [[South Carolina]] that becomes invaded by a malevolent alien parasite.\n\n''Slither'' was theatrically released in the United States on March 31, 2006, by Universal Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who deemed it as \"funny\" and \"creepy\", while praising its premise, B-movie conventions, Gunn's direction, script and the performances of the cast, and has since become a [[cult film]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/emslitherem-54872|title=Slither|last=Tobias|first=Scott|work=[[The A.V.

The parasite enters the town of Wheelsy, [[South Carolina]], where it infects wealthy resident Grant Grant by taking over his body and absorbing his mind. With the alien in control of him, Grant begins to transform into a grotesque, tentacled monstrosity. He also abducts and infects a local woman, Brenda, to serve as a breeder for his alien larvae. His wife Starla becomes suspicious over the changes in his appearance and behavior, leading to Grant attacking her. When the police arrive to rescue Starla, Grant flees.\n\nDuring their search for Grant, a posse led by police chief Bill Pardy discovers Brenda, whose body has become inhumanly bloated from the larvae growing inside her. The slug-like larvae burst from her body and infest everyone in town except Starla, Bill, mayor Jack MacReady, and teenager Kylie Strutemyer. Those infected by the larvae become part of a [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]] controlled by Grant, who intends to consume all lifeforms until only his consciousness remains. However, Grant also retains his love for his wife and seeks to be reunited with her. The survivors deduce that killing Grant will eliminate the rest of the aliens before they are attacked by the infected townspeople. Bill and Kylie escape, but Starla and Jack are captured.\n\nArmed with a grenade to kill the monster, Bill and Kylie head to Grant's home, where the infected are being absorbed by the increasingly-mutated Grant. Jack and others are turned into breeders for more larvae, while Grant keeps Starla uninfected in the hope of regaining her love. After waking up, Starla arms herself with a sharp brush and goes downstairs to find Grant. She tricks him into believing she still loves him and stabs him with the brush. Grant becomes angry and throws her across the room while Bill tries to use the grenade, only for Grant to knock it into the pool. Grant subdues Kylie with a couch and attempts to infect Bill with his tentacles. While one of the tentacles stabs Bill in the stomach, he manages to attach the other tentacle to a propane tank. Filled with flammable gas, Grant is shot by Starla and explodes, killing the rest of the aliens in the process. With everyone else in Wheelsy dead, the three survivors head off to seek help.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], a cat approaches Grant's remains and becomes infected by the alien parasite.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nathan Fillion]] as Police Chief Bill Pardy\n* [[Elizabeth Banks]] as Starla Grant\n* [[Michael Rooker]] as Grant Grant\n* [[Tania Saulnier]] as Kylie Strutemyer\n* [[Gregg Henry]] as Mayor Jack MacReady\n* Don Thompson as Wally\n* Brenda James as Brenda Gutierrez\n* Jennifer Copping as Margaret\n* [[Jenna Fischer]] as Shelby Cunningham\n* Haig Sutherland as Trevor\n\nAdditionally, William MacDonald and Iris Quinn portray Kylie's parents and [[Matreya Fedor]] and Amber Lee Bartlett portray her siblings Emily and Jenna. Other members of Bill's posse are played by Tom Heaton as Tourneur, [[Ben Cotton]] as Charlie, and Dee Jay Jackson as Dwight. Residents of Wheelsy include [[Dustin Milligan]] as a student in Starla's class, [[Lorena Gale]] as Starla's co-worker Janene, [[Darren Shahlavi]] as Brenda's husband, and [[Magda Apanowicz]] in an uncredited role as Kylie's friend. [[Troma Films]] co-founder [[Lloyd Kaufman]] has a cameo as a drunk man and [[Rob Zombie]] provides the voice of Grant's physician Dr. Karl. Director [[James Gunn]] makes an uncredited appearance as Hank, Starla's co-worker.\n\n==Themes and influences==\nControversy ensued over the many similarities and plot-points shared with [[Fred Dekker]]'s 1986 horror-comedy ''[[Night of the Creeps]]''. According to journalist Steve Palopoli:\n\n{{blockquote|When the trailer for ''Slither'' came out, Internet boards about the movie suddenly lit up with protests from a legion of fans of the 1986 film ''Night of the Creeps''. \"Alien slugs that turn people into zombies!\" they cried. \"What a rip-off!\" I bring this up not because I think ''Slither''\u2014 which is a tongue-in-cheek pastiche of at least a dozen '80s horror films\u2014could really be considered a rip-off of any one of them.<ref name=\"slither-0614.html\">{{cite web | author= Steve Palopoli| title=Film Reviews & Movie Showtimes 'Slither'<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=Metro Active| date=2006-04-05 | url=http://www.metroactive.com/bohemian/04.05.06/slither-0614.html| access-date=2009-01-03}}</ref>}}\n\nPalopoli then goes on to directly compare ''Slither'' to the aforementioned ''Creeps'' as well as the 1975 film ''[[Shivers (1975 film)|Shivers]]''. Gunn has stated that both Cronenberg's ''Shivers'' and his 1979 film ''[[The Brood]]'' were the two biggest influences on the story in ''Slither'', along with the 2000 [[manga]] ''[[Uzumaki]]'' by [[Junji Ito]].<ref>{{cite web | author= Elaine Lamkin| title=Slither: Writer/Director James Gunn Gets Sticky\n|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]| date=September 2005 | url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/interview/135| access-date=2009-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author= Sheila Roberts| title=Exclusive : James Gunn Interview|publisher=MoviesOnline| url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_8063.html| access-date=2009-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author= Brian Myers| title=Slither: Exclusive 1-on-1 Interview with James Gunn!|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]| date=2005-07-19| url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/4340| access-date=2009-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author= D_Davis| title=Genrebusters James Gunn - Interview 04/06|publisher=Genre Busters| date=2006-04-05| url=http://www.genrebusters.com/film/interview_jamesgunn.htm| access-date=2009-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/bohemian/04.05.06/slither-0614.html|title='Slither' Slugfest|last=Palopoli|first=Steve|date=April 5\u201311, 2006|publisher=Metroactive|access-date=2009-10-05}}</ref> In an interview with Jeff Schubert, Gunn also states that ''Slither'' was inspired by and pays homage to the horror-comedies from the 1980s.<ref>{{Cite web|last=filmnutlive|date=2009-05-01|title=Writer/Director James Gunn|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmF8bouUbXE |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/OmF8bouUbXE |archive-date=2021-12-21|url-status=live|access-date=2021-10-10|website=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nThe film pays homage to other horror films, such as a farm being owned by Castevet in reference to the Satan-worshiping next-door neighbors in ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]''.
