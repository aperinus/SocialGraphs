[[Frances McDormand]] stars as Marge Gunderson, a pregnant [[Minnesota]] [[chief of police|police chief]] investigating a triple homicide that takes place after a desperate car salesman ([[William H. Macy]]) hires two criminals ([[Steve Buscemi]] and [[Peter Stormare]]) to kidnap his wife in order to extort a hefty [[ransom]] from her wealthy father ([[Harve Presnell]]). The film was an American-British co-production.\n\nFilmed in the United States during the end of 1995, ''Fargo'' premiered at the [[1996 Cannes Film Festival]], where Joel Coen won the festival's ''[[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director|Prix de la mise en sc\u00e8ne]]'' (Best Director Award) and the film was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]]. The film was both a commercial and critical success, earning particular acclaim for the Coens' direction and script and the performances of McDormand, Macy, and Buscemi. ''Fargo'' received seven [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations at the [[69th Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Macy, winning two: [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for McDormand and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for the Coens.\n\nThe film was selected in 2006 for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"\u2014one of only seven films designated in its first year of eligibility.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=2754999|title='Fargo,' 'Blazing Saddles' Added to National Film Registry|date=December 27, 2006|website=[[ABC News]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201014121659/https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=2754999|archive-date=October 14, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"National Film Registry\"/> In 1998, the [[American Film Institute]] named it one of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 greatest American films in history]] (being the most recent film on the list up to that point) but it was subsequently de-listed in 2007.

On the advice of mechanic and convicted felon Shep Proudfoot, Jerry travels to [[Fargo, North Dakota]], and hires Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud to kidnap his wife, Jean. He gives them a new [[Cutlass Ciera]] and promises them half of the $80,000 ransom he says he intends to extract from Wade.\n\nJerry [[Sales presentation|pitches]] Wade a lucrative real estate deal and believes Wade has agreed to lend him $750,000 to finance it, so he attempts to call off the kidnapping. Wade and his accountant Stan Grossman inform Jerry that Wade will make the deal himself and pay Jerry only a modest finder's fee.\n\nCarl and Gaear kidnap Jean and transport her to a remote cabin in [[Moose Lake Township, Cass County, Minnesota|Moose Lake]]. A [[Minnesota State Patrol|state trooper]] stops them near [[Brainerd, Minnesota|Brainerd]] for not displaying temporary registration tags. The trooper rejects Carl's clumsy bribe attempt and hears Jean whimpering in the back seat. Gaear shoots him, then chases down and kills two passers-by who witnessed the scene.\n\nThe following morning, Brainerd police chief Marge Gunderson, who is seven months pregnant, begins investigating. She correctly deduces that the dead trooper was ticketing a car with [[vehicle registration plates of the United States#General registration license plates|dealer plates]]. She later learns that two men driving a dealership vehicle checked into the nearby Blue Ox Motel with two [[call girl]]s and placed a call to Proudfoot. After questioning the girls, Marge visits Wade's dealership, where Proudfoot feigns ignorance and Jerry insists no cars are missing. While in Minneapolis, Marge reconnects with Mike Yanagita, a high school classmate, who awkwardly tries to romance her before breaking down and saying his wife has died.\n\nJerry tells Wade the kidnappers have demanded $1 million and will deal only through him. In light of the three murders, Carl demands Jerry hand over all of the $80,000 he believes is the entire ransom. Carl is with another call girl in a Minneapolis hotel room when Proudfoot enters and attacks him for bringing Proudfoot to the attention of the police. Carl then calls Jerry and orders him to deliver the ransom immediately. Wade insists on bringing it and meets Carl at a parking garage. He refuses to hand over the money without seeing his daughter, so an enraged Carl shoots him. Wade is armed and fires back, wounding Carl in the jaw. Carl kills Wade and a garage attendant, then drives away with the briefcase containing the ransom.\n\nOn the way to Moose Lake, Carl discovers the briefcase contains $1 million. He removes $80,000 to split with Gaear, then buries the rest in the snow alongside the highway. At the cabin, Carl finds that Gaear killed Jean because she would not be quiet. Carl says they should split up and leave immediately, and they argue over who will keep the Ciera. Carl uses his injury as justification, shouts insults at Gaear, and attempts to take the vehicle. Gaear kills Carl with an axe.\n\nMarge learns from a friend that Yanagita lied; he has no wife and is mentally ill. Reflecting on this, Marge returns to Wade's dealership. Jerry nervously insists no cars are missing and promises to double-check his inventory. Marge sees Jerry driving off the lot and calls the state police.\n\nMarge drives to Moose Lake after a local bartender reports having heard a \"funny-looking guy\" brag about killing someone. She drives by the cabin, sees the Ciera, then discovers Gaear feeding Carl's dismembered body into a [[woodchipper]]. Gaear attempts to flee, but Marge shoots him in the leg and arrests him. Shortly afterwards, Jerry is arrested at a motel outside [[Bismarck, North Dakota]].\n\nMarge's husband, Norm, tells her the [[United States Postal Service|Postal Service]] has selected his painting of a [[mallard]] for a three cent [[postage stamp]] and complains that his friend's painting won the competition for a twenty-nine cent stamp. Marge reminds him that many people use smaller denomination stamps whenever prices increase and they need to make up the difference between the face value of their old stamps and the new cost of first class postage. Norm is reassured, and the couple happily anticipates the birth of their child.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Marge Gunderson\n* [[William H.

According to Macy, he was very persistent in getting the role, saying: \"I found out that they [the Coen brothers] were auditioning in New York still, so I got my jolly, jolly Lutheran ass on an airplane and walked in and said, 'I want to read again because I'm scared you're going to screw this up and hire someone else.'

In 1999, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], who acquired the rights to the film through their purchase of Polygram's pre-March 31, 1996, library, released the film on VHS as part of its \"Contemporary Classics\" series. A \"Special Edition\" DVD was released on September 30, 2003, by [[MGM Home Entertainment]], which featured minor changes to the film, particularly with its subtitles. The opening titles stating \"This is a true story\" have been changed in this edition from the actual titles on the film print to digitally inserted titles. Also, the subtitle preceding Lundegaard's arrest \"Outside of Bismarck, North Dakota\" has been inserted digitally and moved from the bottom of the screen to the top. The special edition of ''Fargo'' was repackaged in several Coen brothers box sets and also as a double feature DVD with other MGM releases. A Blu-ray version was released on May 12, 2009, and later in a DVD combo pack in 2010. On April 1, 2014, in commemoration for the 90th anniversary of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the film was remastered in [[4K resolution|4K]] and reissued again on Blu-ray. On May 3, 2017, [[Shout!
