Characterized by its bizarre characters and occurrences, use of maimed and dwarf performers, and heavy doses of [[Judeo-Christian]] symbolism and [[Eastern philosophy]], the film is about \"El Topo\"\u2014a violent, black-clad [[gunfighter]] played by Jodorowsky himself\u2014and his quest for [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]].\n\n==Plot==\n\"El Topo\" is traveling through a [[desert]] on horseback with his naked young son, Hijo. After they come across a town whose people, horses and [[livestock]] have been slaughtered, \"El Topo\" hunts down and kills the perpetrators and their leader, a fat balding Colonel. \"El Topo\" leaves his son to the [[monks]] of the settlement's mission and rides off with a woman whom the Colonel had kept as a [[slave]]. After turning bitter water sweet by stirring it with a branch, \"El Topo\" names the woman Marah. In need of food and [[water]], \"El Topo\" spaces Marah's feet apart and digs up [[eggs]] from the [[sand]] beneath them, then utters a prayer before shooting a [[Rock (geology)|rock]], which then releases water. When Marah tries these same techniques, she turns up nothing, seeming to lack \"El Topo\"'s faith. After \"El Topo\" tears her clothes and apparently [[rape]]s her, Marah promptly becomes able to find eggs and water. She tells \"El Topo\" she will not return his love unless he proves himself the best [[gun-fighter]] by defeating the desert's four great gun masters. Each gun master represents a particular [[religion]] or [[philosophy]] and \"El Topo\" learns from each of them before instigating a duel. \"El Topo\" is victorious each time, not through superior skill but through [[trickery]] or [[luck]].\n\nAfter the first [[duel]], a black-[[clad]] woman who speaks with a man's voice finds the couple and guides them to the remaining gun masters. As he kills each master, \"El Topo\" has increasing doubts about his mission, but Marah persuades him to continue. After the final gun master outsmarts \"El Topo\" by killing himself before \"El Topo\" is able to kill him, \"El Topo\" becomes ridden with guilt, destroys his own gun and revisits the places where he killed the masters, finding their corpses either on [[fire]], covered with [[geometrical]] objects, or swarming with [[bees]]. The unnamed woman confronts \"El Topo\" and shoots him several times in the manner of [[stigmata]]. Marah then rides off with the woman, while \"El Topo\" collapses and is carried away by a group of deformed people.\n\n\"El Topo\" awakens many years later in a [[cave]] to find that the [[tribe]] of [[Mutation|deformed]] outcasts have taken care of him and come to regard him as a god-like figure while he has been asleep and [[meditation|meditating]] on the gun masters' \"four lessons\". The outcasts dwell in a system of caves which have been blocked in \u2014 the only exit is out of their reach due to their deformities. When \"El Topo\" awakens, he is \"born again\" and decides to help the outcasts escape. He is able to reach the exit and, together with a dwarf girl who becomes his lover, [[Street performance|performs]] for the depraved [[cultists]] of the neighboring town to raise money for [[dynamite]] to assist in digging a [[tunnel]] on one side of the mountain where the outcasts have effectively been kept imprisoned.\n\nHijo, now a young monk, arrives in the town to be the new priest, but is disgusted by the religion the cultists practice \u2013 notably symbolized by the frequent display of a basic line drawing of the [[Eye of Providence]] \u2013 and their violent preoccupation with guns, from their church \"[[ritual]]\" through to the film's bloody [[Climax (narrative)|climax]]. Despite \"El Topo\"'s great change in appearance, Hijo recognizes him and intends to kill him on the spot, but agrees to wait until he has succeeded in freeing the outcasts. Now wearing his father's black gunfighter clothes, Hijo grows impatient at the time the project is taking, and begins to work alongside \"El Topo\" to hasten the moment when he will kill him. At the point when Hijo is ready to give up on finishing the tunnel, \"El Topo\" breaks through into the cave. The tunnel has been completed, but Hijo finds that he cannot bring himself to kill his father.\n\nThe outcasts come streaming out, but as they enter the town they are shot down by the cultists. \"El Topo\" helplessly witnesses the community being slaughtered and is shot himself. Powering through his wounds, he massacres the town, then takes an [[oil lamp]] and [[Self-immolation|immolates himself]]. His lover gives birth at the same time, and she and his son make a grave for his remains. This becomes a [[beehive (beekeeping)|beehive]] like one of the gun masters' graves.\n\n\"El Topo\"'s son rides off with his father's lover and child on horseback.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] as \"El Topo\"\n* [[Brontis Jodorowsky]] as Hijo, El Topo's Son, As A Boy\n* [[Alfonso Arau]] as Bandit #1\n* Jos\u00e9 Luis Fern\u00e1ndez as Bandit #2\n* Alf Junco as Bandit #3\n* Jacqueline Luis as El Topo's Wife\n* Mara Lorenzio as Marah\n* Paula Romo as The Woman In Black\n* David Silva as Colonel\n* H\u00e9ctor Mart\u00ednez as First Gunfighter\n* Juan Jos\u00e9 Gurrola as Second Gunfighter\n* V\u00edctor Fosado as Third Gunfighter\n* Alisha Newton as Wife of The Third Gunfighter\n* [[Agust\u00edn Isunza]] as Last Gunfighter\n* Robert John as Hijo, El Topo's Son, As A Man\n* Bertha Lomel\u00ed as Mother of The Second Gunfighter\n* Jos\u00e9 Antonio Alcaraz as Sheriff\n* Jos\u00e9 Legarreta as Dying Man\n\n==Release==\nThere was no original intention to show ''El Topo'' in Mexico, where it was filmed and produced. [[Ben Barenholtz]], an owner of the [[Elgin Theater]] in New York City, saw a private screening of ''El Topo'' at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. Barenholtz recalled that despite several audience members walking out, he was fascinated by the film. On a failing attempt to purchase the American rights to ''El Topo'', Barenholtz convinced the producer to have the film shown at midnight at the Elgin. Barenholtz chose the late showings of 1 am on Friday and at midnight during the week to give audiences a sense of \"self-discovery\". The film premiered on 18 December 1970, and ran continuously seven days a week until the end of June 1971.<ref name=\"Rosenbaum93\">{{cite book|last2=Hoberman|first2=J.|last1=Rosenbaum|first1=Jonathan|title=Midnight movies|date=1991|ISBN=9780306804335|publisher=Da Capo Press|page=93}}</ref> ''El Topo'' was distributed across the United States through [[ABKCO]] Films, owned by [[Allen Klein]], manager of [[the Beatles]]. The film was shown late at night like it was at the Elgin.<ref name=\"Havis 2008 page 59\"/>\n\nFor decades ''El Topo'' could only be seen at such [[midnight movie|midnight screenings]] in art houses and via partially censored Japanese [[laserdisc]]s and bootleg videos. ''El Topo'' was officially released on DVD in May 2007; a [[Blu-ray]] release followed in April 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Disc_Announcements/Starz/Anchor_Bay/El_Topo_&_The_Holy_Mountain_Blu-rays_Announced_/6295 |title='El Topo' & 'The Holy Mountain' Blu-rays Announced |publisher=High-Def Digest |date=7 February 2011 |access-date=30 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\nFollowing the release of the film, Jodorowsky courted controversy when he claimed that the rape scene was unsimulated:\n\n<blockquote>When I wanted to do the rape scene, I explained to [Mara Lorenzio] that I was going to hit her and rape her. There was no emotional relationship between us, because I had put a clause in all the women's contracts stating that they would not make love with the director. We had never talked to each other. I knew nothing about her. We went to the desert with two other people: the photographer and a technician. No one else. I said, 'I'm not going to rehearse. There will be only one take because it will be impossible to repeat. Roll the cameras only when I signal you to [...] And I really... I really... I really raped her. And she screamed.\"<ref name=\"Crouse2010\">{{cite book | first=Richard | last=Crouse | title=Son of the 100 Best Movies You've Never Seen | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5alnowvF3sC&pg=PT111 | date=15 December 2010 | publisher=ECW Press | pages=111\u2013112 | isbn=978-1-55490-330-6}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe went on to state, \"Then she told me that she had been raped before. You see, for me the character is frigid until El Topo rapes her. And she has an orgasm. That's why I show a stone phallus in that scene ... which spouts water. She has an orgasm. She accepts the male sex. And that's what happened to Mara in reality. She really had that problem. Fantastic scene. A very, very strong scene.\"<ref name=\"Crouse2010\"/>\n\nThese comments, and others made by Jodorowsky throughout his career, faced renewed scrutiny in the wake of the [[#MeToo]] movement. In 2019, after [[El Museo del Barrio]] in New York City cancelled a retrospective exhibit on the filmmaker due to the controversy, Jodorowsky clarified that it was part of a publicity stunt: \"They were words, not facts. Surrealist publicity in order to enter the world of cinema from a position of obscurity [...] I acknowledge that this statement is problematic in that it presents fictional violence against a woman as a tool for exposure, and now, fifty years later, I regret that this is being read as truth.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Alejandro Jodorowsky Speaks Out After El Museo Barrio Calls Off Retrospective |url=https://www.artforum.com/news/alejandro-jodorowsky-speaks-out-after-el-museo-del-barrio-calls-off-retrospective-78538 |website=Artforum |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''El Topo'' holds an approval rating of 80%, based on 44 reviews, and an average rating of 7.1/10. Its consensus reads, \"By turns intoxicating and confounding, ''El Topo'' contains the creative multitudes that made writer-director Alejandro Jodorowsky such a singular talent.\"<ref name=\"rottentomatoes\">{{cite web |title=El Topo (1970) \u2013 Rotten Tomatoes |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/el_topo |website=Rotten Tomatoes.com |publisher=Fandango Media |access-date=2 August 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe visuals were the main point of contention amongst the film's critics, who debated if the sequences and montage were meaningful or merely exploitative. Concerning the symbolism within the film, [[Vincent Canby]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote, \"They're all there, in a movie that is all guts (quite literally) but that has no body to give the guts particular shape or function.\" He found the film to be a con.<ref>{{cite news | last=Canby | first=Vincent|title=Is 'El Topo' a Con?|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 May 1971}}</ref> Also writing in the ''Times'', [[Peter Schjeldahl]] disagreed with Canby, describing the film as \"a very strange masterpiece\". He says, \"On first blush it might seem no more than a violent surreal fantasy, a work of fabulous but probably deranged imagination. Surreal and crazy it may be, but it is also (one realizes the second time through) as fully considered and ordered as fine clockwork.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Schjedahl|first=Peter|title=Should 'El Topo' Be Elevated To 'El Tops'?|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 June 1971}}</ref> [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' commented on how the visuals were perceived within the framework of [[drug culture]]. Siskel's review states, \"Under the influence, ''El Topo'' becomes a violent, would-be erotic freakshow, and that, I suppose, can be very heavy. For others, it is enough to make one yawn.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Siskel|first=Gene|title='El Topo' Weighs In With Blood and Guts|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=28 January 1972}}</ref> ''El Topo'' was selected as [[List of Mexican submissions for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Mexico's entry]] for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[44th Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.<ref>Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</ref>\n\nRetrospective critics have been more enthusiastic about the film.
