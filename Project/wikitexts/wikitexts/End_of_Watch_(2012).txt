It stars [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] and [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as Brian Taylor and Mike Zavala, two [[Los Angeles Police Department]] officers who work in [[South Los Angeles]]. The film focuses on their day-to-day police work, their dealings with a certain group of gang members, their friendship with each other, and their personal relationships.\n\nAyer, who had written several [[police procedural]] films previously, wanted the film to focus more on the friendship between partners and daily police work and subordinate the contextual elements of the drug trafficking story taking place on the streets of south-central LA. Gyllenhaal, Pe\u00f1a, and other cast members underwent an intensive training program to prepare for their roles as police officers. Filming took place in [[Los Angeles]] in August 2011 with a budget of $7 million.\n\n''End of Watch'' premiered on September 8, 2012, at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and was released in American theaters on September 21, grossing over $57 million at the box office. The film received a number of accolades, including two [[Independent Spirit Award]] nominations.\n\nA series adaptation of ''End of Watch'' is currently being developed by [[Fox Entertainment]].<ref>{{Cite web|title='End Of Watch' TV Adaptation Co-Written By Movie's David Ayer Gets Fox Script-To-Series Commitment|url=https://deadline.com/2022/02/end-of-watch-tv-adaptation-david-ayer-fox-script-to-series-movie-1234930972/amp/|access-date=2022-07-03|website=deadline.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- WP:FILMPLOT recommends the plot summary to be between 400-700 words. -->\n[[Los Angeles Police Department]] [[police officers|officers]] Brian Taylor and Mike Zavala are close friends and partners in the high crime area of [[South Central Los Angeles|South Central]] in the Newton Division of the LAPD. Taylor, a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] veteran, records their activities for a college class after they return to duty from a recent [[Police use of deadly force in the United States|officer-involved shooting]].\n\nUpon responding to a public disturbance call, Tre, a [[Bloods]] gang member, yells racial insults at Zavala, who responds by accepting a one-on-one fist fight. Zavala wins and earns Tre's respect for not charging him with assault. Later that night, Tre and his fellow Bloods are attacked in a [[drive-by shooting]] by the [[Mexican-American|hispanic]] Curbside Gang. The following night, the officers respond to a noise complaint at a house party where Taylor and Zavala encounter Curbside Gang members \"Big Evil\" and \"LaLa\". Taylor and Zavala rescue children from a house fire while on patrol and are awarded the [[Los Angeles Police Medal of Valor|Medal of Valor]].\n\nDuring a [[traffic stop]], they arrest a man who is in possession of several ornate firearms and large amounts of cash. Taylor urges Zavala to join him in investigating further, leading them to another man guarding a home full of [[human trafficking]] victims. When [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]] agents intervene, the officers learn that the house is tied to the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] and are strongly urged to stay clear due to possible reprisals. Taylor soon becomes engaged to his girlfriend Janet and Zavala's wife Gabby gives birth to their first child.\n\nOne night, Taylor and Zavala respond to a call from their [[rookie]] fellow officer, Sook, and find her partner Van Hauser has been stabbed through the eye. They find and rescue Sook, who was being savagely beaten nearby. Taylor marries Janet, and at their wedding Zavala tells Taylor that, should anything happen to him, he will take care of Janet. The next day, the officers perform a wellness check on an elderly woman. In her house, they discover large amounts of [[heroin]], dismembered corpses, and a message from the cartel. Unbeknownst to them, ICE has eavesdropped on a phone call from the cartel in Mexico and hears the two officers have been \"[[Contract killing|green-lit]]\"; Big Evil, LaLa, and others are tasked with killing them.\n\nWhile on patrol the officers encounter Tre who as a favor from their earlier encounter warns them that some friends who were recently released from [[Folsom State Prison|Folsom prison]] learned that both officers were green-lit, but Taylor and Zavala shrug it off. Taylor reveals to Zavala that Janet is pregnant. They are baited into chasing a reckless driver into an apartment complex where they are ambushed by the Curbside Gang. They fight their way into an alley where Taylor is shot in the chest. As Zavala desperately attends to his partner, the assassins arrive and shoot him several times in the back. Police backup eventually arrives, and the gangsters are killed after refusing to surrender.\n\nTaylor survives, having been shielded by Zavala's body. At Zavala's funeral, Taylor tries to deliver a [[eulogy]], but only manages to say a few words. In a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to the day of the shooting, Zavala recounts to Taylor a humorous story from the first time he and his wife slept together, before the two receive a call from
