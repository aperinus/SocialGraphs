The screenplay was written by [[Bo Goldman]], [[Kevin Wade]], Ron Osborn, and Jeff Reno, and is loosely based on the 1934 film ''[[Death Takes a Holiday]]'', an adaptation of the 1924 Italian play ''La morte in vacanza'' by [[:it:Alberto Casella|Alberto Casella]].\n\nIt was the second pairing of Hopkins and Pitt after their 1994 film ''[[Legends of the Fall]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nMedia mogul Bill Parrish is contemplating a [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger]] with another media giant. Meanwhile, his eldest daughter, Alison, is planning an elaborate 65th birthday party for him. His younger daughter Susan, a [[Residency (medicine)|resident]] in [[internal medicine]], has a relationship with Drew, one of Bill's board members.\n\nConsidering marriage, as Bill sees Susan is not deeply in love, he suggests she wait to be swept off of her feet, suggesting \"lightning could strike\". When the company helicopter lands, he hears a mysterious voice, which he tries to ignore. Arriving in his office, Bill has sharp pains in his chest and hears the voice again, saying, \"Yes.\"\n\nWhile studying in a coffee shop, Susan meets a vibrant young man who also says \"lightning may strike\" a relationship between them. Stunned, she departs without getting his name. Unbeknownst to her, directly afterward, he is struck fatally by multiple cars.\n\nThat evening, Bill hears the voice again and it summons him so Bill meets him alone in a room. Slowly materializing, it identifies itself as Death and is now in the body of the young man. Death explains that his impassioned speech to his daughter piqued his interest. Given Bill's \"competence, experience, and wisdom\", Death says that for as long as Bill will be his guide on Earth, Bill will not have to die. They both return to the dinner table and under pressure to make an introduction, clumsily make up a name for Death, introducing him to the family as \"Joe Black.\" Joe Black, having no sophisticated human qualities, doesn't seem to know how to drink or eat, or how to use food and utensils. He later wanders through the palatial house to adapt. Susan tries to understand his intentions, noting that his character is not the same as that of the man she met in the coffee shop.\n\nBill fails to keep events from going rapidly out of his control. Drew secretly conspires with Parrish Communications, capitalizing on Bill's strange behavior and reliance on Joe to convince the board of directors to vote Bill out as chairman. Using information from Bill's son-in-law, Quince, Drew pushes for merger approval which Bill now opposes.\n\nIntrigued by Joe's naivete, Susan sees he's very different from the young man she met in the coffee shop. She falls deeply in love, while Joe is now under the influence of human desires and a magnetic attraction to her, and they make love. After they dress, Joe asks Susan, \"What do we do now?\" She replies, \"It'll come to us.\" Bill inadvertently walks in and sees them kissing.\n\nBill angrily confronts Joe about his relationship with his daughter. He then suggests to Susan that Joe won't  be around much longer. At Susan's hospital, Joe interacts with a terminally ill old woman who wishes to die. Understanding who he is, when he tells her he loves Susan, they discuss the meaning of life and she helps him understand he is dangerously meshing two worlds. When Joe asks her if she is ready to go, she acceeds.\n\nAs Bill's birthday arrives, Joe declares his intention to take Susan with him. Bill pleads with Joe to recognize the meaning of true love, especially honesty and sacrifice, and to not steal Susan's life. \n\nAt the party, knowing his death is imminent, Bill makes peace with his daughters. Susan tells Joe she has loved him since the day in the coffee shop and he hints that his time is coming to an end. Realizing Susan loves the unknown man, not him, crushes him. He doesn't tell her who he really is, but she seems to intuit something mystical about his identity. Struggling to comprehend the magnitude of their attraction, Susan refuses to recognize Joe as Death. He says \"You know who I am\". She sputters, \"You're... you're Joe.\" He promises, \"You will always have what you found in the coffee shop... I'll love you always.\" Joe realizes he must set aside his own desire and allow Susan to live her life. \n\nQuince apologizes to Bill for undermining the company, and Bill forgives him. Joe helps Bill regain control of his company, exposing Drew's underhanded business dealings to the board by claiming to be an agent of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and threatening to put Drew in jail.\n\nIn their father/daughter dance, Susan and Bill say goodbye. Fireworks begin, and on a hilltop above the party, Joe waits with tears in his eyes. Bill heads up to him, and they share their thoughts. Bill asks Joe if he should be afraid. He replies, \"Not a man like you.\" As the fireworks explode in the distance, Susan watches Joe and her father cross a bridge at the top of the hill and descend out of sight on the other side.\n\nSusan stands stunned as \"Joe\" reappears alone and bewildered. He is again the young man from the coffee shop, uninjured and not comprehending where he is. Susan intuits that her father is gone, and the magnetism that she had shared with this young man has returned. \"What do we do now?\" she asks. \"It'll come to us,\" he replies, as they descend hand-in-hand toward the party.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, plus four, all roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Death (personification)|Death / \"Joe Black\"]]\n** also the young man in the coffee shop borrowed by Death\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Bill Parrish\n* [[Claire Forlani]] as Susan Parrish\n* [[Jake Weber]] as Drew\n* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as Allison Parrish\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Quince Parrish\n* David S.
