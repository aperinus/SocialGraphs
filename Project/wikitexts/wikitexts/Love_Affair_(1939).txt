It was directed by [[Leo McCarey]] and written by [[Delmer Daves]] and [[Donald Ogden Stewart]], based on a story by McCarey and [[Mildred Cram]].<ref name=\"Love Affair 1939\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/3938/Love-Affair/full-credits.html|title=Love Affair 1939|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|access-date=May 22, 2016}}</ref> Controversial on concept, the official screenplay was re-tooled and rewritten to appease Hollywood censorship and relied on actor input and improvisation, causing long delays and budget extensions.\n\nThe movie became a surprise hit of 1939, showing McCarey's versatility after a long career of comedic films, and launching the surprising team-up of Dunne and Boyer. [[Academy Award]] nominations include [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Dunne, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Ouspenskaya, [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]], [[Academy Award for Best Story|Best Writing (Original)]], and [[Best Picture]]. Its popularity was later dwarfed by McCarey's 1957 remake ''[[An Affair to Remember]]'', which spawned its own remakes with 1994's ''[[Love Affair (1994 film)|Love Affair]]'' and a few Indian adaptations.\n\n==Plot==\nOne December, French painter (and famed womanizer) Michel Marnet (Charles Boyer) meets American singer Terry McKay (Irene Dunne) aboard a [[Ocean liner|liner]] crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. They are both already engaged, he to heiress Lois Clarke ([[Astrid Allwyn]]), she to Kenneth Bradley ([[Lee Bowman]]). They begin to flirt and to dine together on the ship, but his worldwide reputation makes them conscious that others are watching. Eventually, they decide that they should dine separately and not associate with each other. At a stop at [[Madeira]], they visit Michel's grandmother Janou ([[Maria Ouspenskaya]]), who bonds with Terry and admits wanting Michel to settle down.\n \nAs the ship is ready to disembark at New York City, the two make an appointment to meet in the new year, six months later on top of the [[Empire State Building]], giving Michel enough time to decide whether he can start making enough money to support a relationship with Terry. His paintings fail to sell so he finds work designing advertising billboards around the city, while Terry successfully negotiates a contract with a [[Philadelphia]]n nightclub to perform through to June. When the rendezvous date arrives, they both head to the Empire State Building. However, Terry is struck by a car on a nearby road, and is told by doctors she may be paralyzed for the rest of her life, though that will not be known for certain for six months. Not wanting to be a burden to Michel, she does not contact him, preferring to let him think the worst. Meanwhile, Michel, who waited until closing time, travels to Madeira to discover his grandmother has recently died, and continues working in New York City; Terry is overheard singing in the garden of her [[physiotherapy]] by the owner of a children's orphanage, who hires her as a music teacher.\n\nSix months pass by, and during Terry's first outing since the accident, she and Michel meet by accident at a theater on Christmas Eve, though Terry manages to conceal her disability. The next morning on Christmas Day, after the children visit Terry at her apartment, Michel makes a surprise visit. Here, he finally learns the truth about Terry's condition. Terry, delighted Michel proved he had changed his ways despite circumstances, tells him it is her turn to prove she could change hers, but Michel assures her that they will be together no matter what the diagnosis may be.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Irene Dunne]] as Terry McKay\n* [[Charles Boyer]] as Michel Marnet\n* [[Maria Ouspenskaya]] as Grandmother Janou\n* [[Lee Bowman]] as Kenneth Bradley\n* [[Astrid Allwyn]] as Lois Clarke\n* [[Maurice Moscovitch]] as Maurice Cobert, art dealer\n* [[Scotty Beckett]] as Boy on ship (uncredited) \n* [[Dell Henderson]] as Cafe Manager (uncredited)\n* [[Lloyd Ingraham]] as\tDoctor (uncredited)\n* [[Frank McGlynn Sr.]] as Orphanage Superintendent (uncredited)\n\nOther uncredited actors include [[Ferike Boros]],<ref>{{cite news |last1=Heffernan |first1=Harold |title=Long forgotten actress given second chance |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/37776009/ferike_boros/ |work=Calgary Herald|date=April 19, 1939 |location=[[Calgary, Alberta]] |page=10}}</ref> [[Joan Leslie]], [[Oscar O'Shea]], [[Lloyd Ingraham]], [[Bess Flowers]] and Harold Miller (as couple on liner), [[Phyllis Kennedy]], and [[Gerald Mohr]].<ref name=\"crew\">{{cite book |last1=Schultz |first1=Margie |title=Irene Dunne : a bio-bibliography |date=1991 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=New York |isbn=9780313273995 |page=92}}</ref>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:IreneDunneinLoveAffair.jpg|Irene Dunne\nFile:CharlesBoyerinLoveAffair.jpg|Charles Boyer\nFile:MaraiaOuspenskayainLoveAffair.jpg|Maria Ouspenskaya\nFile:LeeBowmaninLoveAffair.jpg|Lee Bowman\n</gallery>\n\n== Development ==\nDespite the popularity of his [[romantic comedy|romantic]] and [[screwball comedies]], Leo McCarey had become tired of directing them.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Creelman |first1=Eileen |title=Leo McCarey Tells of Directing Irene Dunne in a New Comedy \"The Awful Truth\" |work=New York Sun |date=November 3, 1937 |quote=However the public may feel about charmingly insane people on screen, Leo McCarey is fed up with them.}}</ref> His wife suggested they should go on a cruising vacation around Europe to combat his [[writer's block]], and when they returned to the United States, they watched the [[Statue of Liberty]] pass.
