Rather than setting up the plot, the opening crawl states that the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] required [[Seth MacFarlane]] to complete the trilogy to be allowed to direct ''[[Ted (film)|Ted]]''.\n\nOn [[Tatooine]], [[R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO]] find [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s palace in order to initiate a plan to save [[Han Solo]], still frozen in carbonite for posterity. [[Princess Leia|Leia]] unfreezes Han but Jabba captures her and she is shackled by Jabba's side. Han, meanwhile, is thrown into a prison cell with [[Chewbacca]]. [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]] arrives at the palace and attempts to bargain for the release of his friends. Jabba opens a trap door and Luke falls into a pit where he battles and kills the [[Rancor]]. Afterwards, Jabba orders Luke and his friends to be eaten by the [[Sarlacc]]. Luke initiates an assault on Jabba's crew with the help of [[Lando Calrissian]]. Leia chokes Jabba using her slave chains while the others commandeer a transport ship.\n\nLuke and R2-D2 fly to [[Dagobah]] so Luke can finish his training with [[Yoda]] while the others rejoin the rebel fleet. On Dagobah, Yoda explains the final part of training is to face Vader. In his dying words, Yoda reveals that Luke has a sibling. The spirit of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] explains that his sibling is Princess Leia.\n\n[[Admiral Ackbar]] explains that to destroy the [[Death Star]] they must first disable a shield generator on the forest moon of [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]]. Han uses a stolen Imperial ship and old access code to sneak past the Empire's blockade. Vader allows them passage, knowing Luke is aboard. When they reach the moon's surface, the rebels are spotted by Imperial soldiers which they stop from reporting after a high-speed chase. Separated from the others, Leia is befriended by [[Wicket W. Warrick|Wicket]] the [[Ewok]]. Luke, Han, Chewie and the droids fall into an Ewok trap while searching for Leia. They are captured and brought to the village where Leia is being housed. The Ewoks believe C-3PO is a god and begin to worship him. Luke tells Princess Leia they are siblings, but Leia claims to have already known that.\n\nFollowing Yoda's advice, Luke surrenders to Vader in order to confront him. Vader tries to convince Luke to turn to the dark side. Luke refuses and the two meet with the Emperor, who reveals that Luke's friends are walking into a trap on the forest moon. When this revelation fails to anger Luke, the Emperor begins to mock actor [[Seth Green]] (who voices Chris). Luke defends Green saying that he's been in successful projects, only to have The Emperor saying the negative side of Green's roles. Luke becomes enraged and begins dueling with Vader.\n\nBack on the forest moon, Han leads the rebels to the shield generator, however, the company is ambushed. The Ewoks help the rebels escape from the Imperial troops and destroy the shield generator, while Lando and Nien Nunb lead the attack on the Death Star.\n\nLuke finally subdues Vader, but he refuses to execute him and join the dark side at the Emperor's request. The Emperor then incapacitates Luke with his powerful [[Force lightning]]. Because Luke asks Vader politely for help, Vader gathers his remaining strength and kills the distracted Emperor by throwing him into the reactor core. Vader and Luke manage to flee the Death Star before Lando and his crew blow it up. Unfortunately, when Vader asks Luke to help him remove his mask (to \"look on you with my own eyes\"), Luke accidentally twists and breaks Vader's neck. Everyone rendezvous back at the Ewok village to celebrate the rebels victory over the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]]. While the Ewoks kill the wounded Imperials, the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda appear to Luke, alongside the spirit of the redeemed [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]], who angrily accuses Luke of murdering him and starts swearing at him.\n\nThe Griffins' power returns just as Peter concludes the story, Meg then asks Peter \"What about the prequel trilogy?\" with Peter suggesting that ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' might do [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|the prequels]]. After that, the family starts arguing about whether Seth Green or Seth MacFarlane is a better artist.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Chris Griffin]] as [[Luke Skywalker]]\n*[[Peter Griffin]] as [[Han Solo]]\n*[[Lois Griffin]] as [[Princess Leia]]\n*[[Mort Goldman]] as [[Lando Calrissian]]\n*[[Glenn Quagmire]] as [[C-3PO]]\n*[[Cleveland Brown]] as [[R2-D2]]\n*[[Brian Griffin]] as [[Chewbacca]]\n*[[Klaus Heissler]] as [[Admiral Ackbar]] (crossover from ''[[American Dad!]]'')\n*[[Carter Pewterschmidt]] as [[Darth Sidious|Emperor Palpatine]]\n*[[Herbert (Family Guy)|Herbert]] as [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]\n*[[List of Family Guy characters#Carl|Carl]] as [[Yoda]]\n*[[Stewie Griffin]] as [[Darth Vader|Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker]]\n*[[Joe Swanson]] as [[Jabba the Hutt]]\n*[[Ernie the Giant Chicken]] as [[Boba Fett]]\n*[[Rallo Tubbs]] as [[Nien Nunb]] (crossover from ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'')\n*[[Meg Griffin]] as the [[Sarlacc]]\n*[[Roger the Alien|Roger]] as [[Moff Jerjerrod]] (crossover from ''American Dad!'')\n*[[Tim the Bear]] as [[Wicket W.

The settled-upon title is a reference to the line by [[Admiral Ackbar]] in the film, which became an [[Internet meme]] through [[YTMND]].\n\nDue to the declining number of unused ''Family Guy'' characters, the episode also features characters from ''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'': [[Roger (American Dad!)|Roger]] appears as Moff Jerjerrod, (with Vader/Stewie commenting \"Are we already out of our own characters?\") [[Klaus Heissler|Klaus]] appears as Admiral Ackbar, [[Ariana the Bear|Tim]] appears as Wicket the Ewok and [[Rallo Tubbs|Rallo]] appears as Nien Nunb. [[Stan Smith (American Dad!)|Stan]] was originally going to appear as [[Wedge Antilles]], but his part got cut (he is still mentioned when Lando orders him to destroy [[the Power Station (band)|the Power Station]] in the main reactor of the Death Star).\n\nThe role of [[Meg Griffin]] continues to be minor, this time taking the role of the [[Sarlacc]].\n\nThe episode featured voice [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] from [[Patrick Stewart]] and [[Michael Dorn]] reprising their roles of Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] and Lieutenant [[Worf]] from ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', [[Adam West]], [[Carrie Fisher]] and [[Rush Limbaugh]] as the [[Rancor]] (Limbaugh had previously made a cameo as himself in \"Blue Harvest\").<ref>[https://www.starwars.com/fans/media/family_guy_trap/index.html ''Family Guy: It's a Trap!''
