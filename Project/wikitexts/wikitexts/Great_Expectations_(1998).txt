A contemporary film adaptation of [[Charles Dickens]]\u2019s [[Great Expectations|1861 novel of the same name]], co-written and directed by [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]] and starring [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Hank Azaria]], [[Robert De Niro]], [[Anne Bancroft]] and [[Chris Cooper]]. It is known for having moved the setting of the original novel from 1812-1827 London to 1990s New York. The film is an abridged modernization of Dickens's 1861 novel, with the hero's name having been changed from [[Pip (Great Expectations)|Pip]] to Finn, and the characters of [[Miss Havisham]] having been renamed Nora Dinsmoor and [[Abel Magwitch]] being renamed to Arthur Lustig. The film received mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nTen-year-old Finnegan \"Finn\" Bell, an orphan being raised by his elder sister Maggie and her boyfriend Joe, is overpowered by an escaped convict while playing on a beach on the [[Gulf Coast]]. Finn brings him food, alcohol and [[bolt cutters]] to get the iron shackles off his leg, and is taken hostage. The convict tries to escape to [[Mexico]] but the police seize his small boat. The convict hides on a buoy and the police tow Finn back to land. Finn sees on the news that the now recaptured convict was mobster Arthur Lustig who had escaped from [[death row]].\n\nJoe is called to do gardening at \"Paradiso Perduto\" (\"Lost Paradise\" in Italian), the mansion of the richest woman in Florida, Nora Dinsmoor, who has lived as a recluse since her fianc\u00e9 left her at the altar years before. Finn accompanies Joe and encounters Dinsmoor's young niece, the beautiful Estella. Dinsmoor invites Finn to come back and play with Estella. She behaves haughtily on Finn's first visit, but her aunt forces her to sit for an impromptu portrait by Finn. Dinsmoor warns Finn that he will fall in love with Estella and have his heart broken.\n\nSeveral years pass. Maggie runs away from home and Joe raises Finn alone. Finn goes to Paradiso Perduto every Saturday and develops into a talented painter. Although Estella is at times flirtatious, even attempting to seduce Finn at one point, she leaves to study in Europe without telling him. Heartbroken, Finn gives up painting and his visits to Paradiso Perduto.\n\nSeven years later, a lawyer tells Finn that a gallery owner in New York City wants to show his work. Finn is perplexed but agrees to go. There he encounters Estella in the park. She is in a relationship with a wealthy businessman, Walter. She resumes her flirtatious behavior towards Finn, posing nude in his apartment and arousing Walter's jealousy.\n\nEventually Finn, frustrated by Estella's evasiveness, lures her away from Walter and the two have sex. She tells him she is going to visit her aunt briefly, but will be back for the opening of Finn's show. But on opening night she fails to show up. But Uncle Joe does, and inadvertently embarrasses Finn with his crudeness. Finn goes to Estella's abode in New York, hoping to find her, but instead finds Ms. Dinsmoor, who reveals that she came to New York to attend Estella's wedding to Walter, which upsets Finn. She then tells him that Estella was using him to make Walter jealous and convince him to marry her. When she realizes how seriously she has upset him, she is remorseful and apologizes for her manipulation, but it is too late.\n\nBack at his studio, Finn finds a strange bearded man wanting to see him. It is Arthur Lustig! Finn is first incredulous, then uncomfortable with his presence. As Lustig leaves, his comments make Finn realize that he, not the wealthy Ms. Dinsmoor, has in fact been Finn's benefactor during Finn's entire time in New York. Finn goes with him to the subway station.\n\nWaiting for a train, Lustig sees three unsavory acquaintances on the opposite platform. Finn and Lustig outmaneuver them and get on a train. They think they are safe, but one of them comes through the car and brutally stabs Lustig. As he bleeds to death in Finn's arms, he reveals that he has been Finn's benefactor in return for the kindness Finn showed him as a child.\n\nDevastated, Finn drops everything, goes to Paris to study art, and becomes successful. He returns to Florida to visit his Uncle Joe. Ms. Dinsmoor has died, but he visits her house anyway. Sitting in the garden, he thinks he sees an apparition of Estella as a child. Following the little girl through to the back dock, he finds her mother, who turns out to be Estella, now divorced. She admits she has often thought of him, and asks him to forgive her, which he does. They hold hands looking out over the sea.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as [[Pip (Great Expectations)|Finnegan \"Finn\" Bell]]\n** [[Jeremy James Kissner]] as 10-year-old Finn\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as [[Estella (Great Expectations)|Estella]]\n** Raquel Beaudene as 10-year-old Estella\n* [[Chris Cooper]] as Joe Coleman\n* [[Hank Azaria]] as Walter Plane\n* [[Anne Bancroft]] as [[Miss Havisham|Ms. Nora Dinsmoor]]\n* [[Robert DeNiro]] as [[Abel Magwitch|Arthur Lustig]]\n* [[Josh Mostel]] as Jerry Ragno\n* [[Kim Dickens]] as Maggie\n* [[Nell Campbell]] as Erica Thrall\n* [[Gabriel Mann]] as Owen\n* [[Stephen Spinella]] as Carter Macleish\n\n==Locations used==\n* [[Ca' d'Zan]], an historic residence in [[Sarasota]], Florida, was used for the exterior and parts of the interior of Paradiso Perduto. The mansion was built in 1924 by [[John Nicholas Ringling|Mable and John Ringling]]. The fa\u00e7ade was dressed to appear decrepit and overgrown,<ref>Though, at that time, the mansion '''''was''''' decrepit and overgrown, the result of years of neglect; it spurred efforts to renovate and restore the mansion to its historic glory.</ref> a gate was added to the avenue approaching the front, and the interior ballroom and loggia facing the waterfront terrace were also dressed for the dancing scenes.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.ringling.org/history-ca-dzan| title=History of Ca' d'Zan| publisher=www.theringling.org| access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.flamingomag.com/2017/03/01/ringling-ca-dzan//| title=C\u00e0 d'Zan: A Monumental Love Story| author=Katie Hendrick| publisher=Flamingo magazine| date=2017-03-01| access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref>\n* [[Bradenton, Florida]] - Cortez Road and Sarasota Bay - was used for the approach and gardens of Paradiso Perduto.\n* [[Hempstead House]] on [[Long Island, NY]] was used for the interior fountain court of Paradiso Perduto.\n* The [[Harry F. Sinclair House]] at East 79th St. and 5th Avenue in Manhattan acted as the exterior for Ms. Dinsmoor's New York mansion.\n\n==Production==\nDirector Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n was a big fan of [[Ethan Hawke]]'s work in ''[[Before Sunrise]]'' (1995) and strongly wanted him to play the lead.\nHawke was initially not interested - he felt that the themes of class present in the story would be better served in an American context if the main character was Latino or African American. However, after meeting with Cuar\u00f3n and being impressed with the director's enthusiasm for the project, Hawke agreed.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDrTTIzz190&list=PL0hKMB1-xkc-IZgAqdrVO6qlPaDWW_jEl |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211214/iDrTTIzz190 |archive-date=2021-12-14 |url-status=live| title=Ethan Hawke Breaks Down His Most Iconic Roles| author=GQ| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2018-08-06| access-date=2018-08-08}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nThe voiceovers were not in the original screenplay. Once the film was edited together, producer [[Art Linson]] felt voiceover was needed to maintain connective tissue in the hyperstylized world Cuaron had created. Having previously worked with screenwriter [[David Mamet]] on ''[[The Edge (1997 film)|The Edge]]'' and ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'', Linson hired him to write the voiceovers. Mamet was not credited in the final film.<ref name=\"Linson 2002\">{{cite book|last=Linson|first=Art|title=What Just Happened?|year=2002|publisher=Bloomsbury Pub Plc USA|isbn=1-58234-240-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/whatjusthappened00lins}}</ref>\n\nThe name of Hawke's character was undecided for a while, with the original novel's [[Pip (Great Expectations)|Pip]] sounding unpalatable given this version's modern day setting. The production later settled on Finnegan, or Finn, the name of Hawke's dog.<ref name=\"Linson 2002\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe song \"Siren\" was written for this film by [[Tori Amos]]. The soundtrack also includes songs by popular artists such as [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]], [[Scott Weiland]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[Chris Cornell]] and [[The Verve Pipe]]. [[Duncan Sheik]]'s contribution, the song \"[[Wishful Thinking (Duncan Sheik song)|Wishful Thinking]]\", was released as a single from the soundtrack and [[Poe (singer)|Poe's]] \"Today\" was released as a promo. The film's score was written by Scottish composer [[Patrick Doyle]], a veteran of many literary adaptations and frequent collaborator of [[Kenneth Branagh]], and featured classical guitarist [[John Williams]].\n\nSeveral variations of the song ''[[B\u00e9same Mucho]]'' are heard throughout the film. The primary recording, however, and the version released on the soundtrack, is performed by [[Cesaria Evora]].\n\nThe soundtrack also featured the breakthrough single \"[[Life in Mono (song)|Life in Mono]]\", which became a major hit, charting on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nThe score track \"Kissing in the Rain\" was sampled in the song \"RoboCop\" on [[Kanye West]]'s 2008 album, ''[[808s & Heartbreak]]''.\n\n#Finn (Intro) - Instrumental Vocalization by [[Tori Amos]]\n#Siren - Performed by [[Tori Amos]]\n#[[Life in Mono]] - Performed by [[Mono (UK band)|Mono]]\n#Sunshower - Performed by [[Chris Cornell]]\n#Resignation - Performed by [[Reef (band)|Reef]]\n#Like a Friend - Performed by [[Pulp discography|Pulp]]\n#[[Wishful Thinking (Duncan Sheik song)|Wishful Thinking]] - Performed by [[Duncan Sheik]]\n#Today - Performed by [[Poe (singer)|Poe]]\n#[[Lady, Your Roof Brings Me Down]] - Performed by [[Scott Weiland]]\n# Her Ornament - Performed by the [[Verve Pipe]]\n#Walk This Earth Alone - Performed by [[Lauren Christy]]\n#Breakable - Performed by [[Fisher (band)|Fisher]]\n#Success - Performed by [[Iggy Pop]]\n#Slave - Performed by [[David Garza (musician)|David Garza]]\n#[[Uncle John's Band]] - Performed by the [[Grateful Dead]]\n#Besame Mucho - Performed by [[Ces\u00e1ria \u00c9vora]]\n\n==Novelization==\nA [[novelization]] of the film was written by Deborah Chiel, and published by [[St. Martin's Press]].\n\n==Reception==\n''Great Expectations'' received mixed or average reviews. Based on 24 critic reviews from mainstream publication, [[Metacritic]] assigned the film a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on reviews from 24 critics.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/great-expectations|title=Great Expectations reviews|publisher= [[CBS]] | work = [[Metacritic]]|access-date=2012-12-01}}</ref> [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 37% based on 35 reviews.

He stated that \"nobody gave a shit about anything but ''Titanic'' for about 9 months after...particularly another romance.\"<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n\nAudiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite web |title=Home - Cinemascore |url=https://www.cinemascore.com/ |website=Cinemascore |access-date=28 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016 at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]], in a discussion about their collaborations, Cuaron and cinematographer [[Emmanuel Lubezki]] both stated their dissatisfaction with the film. Cuaron called it \"a complete failed film\" while Lubezki said it was \u201cthe least satisfying of our movies.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/alfonso-cuaron-great-expectations-1201757974/|title=How Alfonso Cuaron Went Back to Scratch to Rekindle His Career After 'Great Expectations'|author=Lang, Brent|date=20 April 2016|publisher=variety.com|accessdate=11 February 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Artwork and portraits used in the film==\nAll of Finn's artwork and portraits of the main characters in the film were done by [[Francesco Clemente]], an Italian painter.
