Avildsen]]. It is the second installment in the ''[[The Karate Kid (franchise)|Karate Kid]]'' franchise and the sequel to the 1984 film ''[[The Karate Kid]]'', starring [[Ralph Macchio]] and [[Pat Morita]]. ''The Karate Kid Part II'' follows [[Daniel LaRusso]] (Macchio), who accompanies his karate teacher [[Mr. Miyagi]] (Morita) to see his dying father in [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]], only to encounter an old friend-turned-rival with a long-harbored grudge against Miyagi.\n\nFollowing the success of the first installment, preparation for a sequel began immediately. Upon completion of the final script, Macchio and Morita were re-signed and additional casting took place between May and July 1985. Principal photography began in September in [[Los Angeles]], and filming completed in December. Locations included [[Oahu]], which was used to represent Okinawa in the film.\n\n''The Karate Kid Part II'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 20, 1986. The film received mixed reviews, with critics praising Morita's performance as well as the new location and characters, while others criticized elements of the storyline, the antagonists, and some of the action scenes. The film was a commercial success, grossing {{US$|130 million|long=no}} worldwide,<ref name=\"worldwide\"/> making it one of the highest-grossing films of 1986.<ref>{{cite news|title= Screen: 'Karate Kid Part II|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=20 June 1986|url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0DE4DD163DF933A15755C0A960948260|access-date=26 July 2014|first=Vincent|last=Canby}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= The Karate Kid Part II |publisher= Variety|date=January 1, 1986|url= https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117792263.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 |access-date=26 July 2014}}{{Dead link|date=August 2020}}</ref> A sequel titled ''[[The Karate Kid Part III]]'' was released in 1989.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nAfter his dojo's loss in the [[Ali_Mills_(character)#High_school_relationship_and_breakup_with_Daniel|1984 All-Valley Karate Tournament]], a furious [[John Kreese]] attacks his student, [[Johnny Lawrence (character)|Johnny Lawrence]], in the parking lot. Miyagi intervenes and passively immobilizes Kreese. He threatens a deadly blow but instead comically tweaks Kreese's nose and walks away. Johnny and his friends leave a humiliated Kreese and Cobra Kai behind. Six months later, in June 1985, Daniel and [[Ali_Mills_(character)#High_school_relationship_and_breakup_with_Daniel|Ali]] have broken up, and Daniel is staying with Miyagi after his mother accepts a job in Fresno. Miyagi receives a letter notifying him that his father is dying, prompting him to return to his home village on [[Okinawa Island]]. He tells Daniel that many years ago, he fell in love with a woman named [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Yukie|Yukie]]. She was arranged to marry his best friend [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Sato|Sato]], son of the richest man in the village and fellow karate student of his father. Upon announcing his intentions to marry Yukie, Sato challenged him to a fight to the death. Rather than fight, however, Miyagi left the country. Daniel decides to accompany him back to Okinawa.\n\nUpon arrival, Miyagi and Daniel are greeted by [[Chozen Toguchi]], who drives Miyagi and Daniel to one of Sato's warehouses and reveals he is Sato's nephew. Sato appears and demands to fight Miyagi, who adamantly refuses. Arriving at the village, Miyagi and Daniel are welcomed by Yukie and her niece  [[Kumiko (character)|Kumiko]]. They discover that Sato has become a rich [[industrialist]] whose [[fishing trawler|supertrawlers]] have destroyed the local fish population, impoverishing the other villagers. They are forced to rent property from Sato, who owns the village's land title. Yukie reveals that she never married Sato because of her love for Miyagi.\n\nMiyagi's father dies, and Sato gives him three days to mourn out of respect before their fight. Miyagi shows Daniel the secret to his family's karate \u2013 a [[Den-den daiko|handheld drum]] that twists back and forth illustrating the \"drum technique\", a counter-striking karate move that Daniel begins to practice. Daniel and Kumiko begin to develop a romance.\n\nDaniel unintentionally exposes corruption in Chozen's grocery business during an encounter in the village. Chozen accuses Daniel of insulting his honor, and they have a series of confrontations. The feud escalates when Chozen and his cronies attack Daniel and vandalize Miyagi's family property, but Miyagi fends them off. He and Daniel plan to return home before the situation gets worse, but Sato threatens to destroy the village if Miyagi refuses to fight. Miyagi finally agrees on the condition that Sato signs the village's land title over to the villagers regardless of the fight's outcome. Sato reluctantly concedes.\n\nOn the day of the fight, a typhoon strikes the village forcing everyone to take shelter. Sato's dojo collapses, leaving him trapped in the wreckage. Miyagi and Daniel rush to rescue him, and Daniel ventures back out to rescue a child trapped in a nearby bell tower. Sato orders Chozen to help, but when he refuses, Sato rushes to assist Daniel himself. He publicly shames his nephew and disowns him. An enraged Chozen runs off into the storm in disgrace. The next day, Sato returns asking for Miyagi's forgiveness. He vows to help rebuild the village and relinquish the title to the villagers. He also agrees to host the [[Bon Festival|O-bon]] festival in a nearby ceremonial castle, inviting Daniel to join. During the celebration, a vengeful Chozen ziplines into the presentation and takes Kumiko hostage, demanding to fight Daniel to the death. Daniel fights bravely but is eventually overwhelmed by Chozen. Miyagi, Sato, and the crowd respond by twisting handheld drums in unison, inspiring Daniel to utilize the drum technique to defeat Chozen. Daniel grabs the vanquished Chozen and threatens to end his life saying, \"Live or die, man?!\" Chozen chooses death, but remembering the way Miyagi handled Kreese earlier, Daniel instead playfully tweaks Chozen's nose and drops him to the ground. The onlookers cheer as Daniel and Kumiko embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters}}\n* [[Ralph Macchio]] as [[Daniel LaRusso]]\n* [[Pat Morita]] as [[Mr. Miyagi]]\n* [[Nobu McCarthy]] as [[List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters#Yukie|Yukie]]\n* [[Tamlyn Tomita]] as [[Kumiko (character)|Kumiko]]\n* [[Yuji Okumoto]] as [[Chozen Toguchi]]\n* [[Danny Kamekona]] as [[List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters#Sato|Sato]]\n* [[Joey Miyashima]] as [[List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters#Toshio|Toshio]]\n* [[Marc Hayashi]] as [[List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters#Taro|Taro]]\n;Opening sequence:\n* [[Martin Kove]] as [[John Kreese]]\n* [[William Zabka]] as [[Johnny Lawrence (character)|Johnny Lawrence]]\n* [[Tony O'Dell]] as [[List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters#Jimmy|Jimmy]]\n* Ron Thomas as [[List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters#Bobby Brown|Bobby]]\n* [[Rob Garrison]] as [[List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters#Tommy|Tommy]]\n* [[Chad McQueen]] as [[List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters#Dutch|Dutch]]\n* [[Pat E.

It was originally planned as the ending for the first film, although it was not shot until after the second film's production began.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrocrush.com/archive2007/zabka/index.html |title=\"Sweep the Leg!\" The Billy Zabka Interview |last1=Berry |first1=Robert |work=retrocrush.com |access-date=26 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] took place in [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]], in the northeastern area of the island known as the \"windward side\". The local countryside in modern-day Okinawa had been drastically changed due to the presence of military bases, so other locations in both Japan and Hawaii were scouted as alternative filming locations. Filmmakers selected a property in Oahu that was privately owned by a retired local physician who agreed to allow a portion of the land to be used in the film. To form the Okinawan village portrayed in the film, seven authentic replicas of Okinawan houses were constructed along with more than three acres of planted crops. Fifty Okinawa-born Hawaii residents were also recruited as [[Extra (acting)|film extras]]. Filming began on September 23, 1985, and ended on December 20.<ref name=\"Palm Beach Post\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1964&dat=19851114&id=-QIjAAAAIBAJ&pg=1075,2017505|title='Karate Kid II' Under Way in Hawaii|last=Thomas|first=Bob|date=November 14, 1985|work=The Palm Beach Post|access-date=March 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonymoviechannel.com/movies/karate-kid-part-ii/details|title='The Karate Kid Part II' Production Notes|publisher=Sony Movie Channel|access-date=March 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe [[film score|musical score]] for ''The Karate Kid Part II'' was composed by [[Bill Conti]], who wrote the score for the previous installment, and is the only one of the trilogy not to feature the [[pan flute]] of [[Gheorghe Zamfir]] (a decision the composer regretted, according to the anniversary album liner notes). The film's signature tune was [[Peter Cetera]]'s song \"[[Glory of Love]]\", which was a No. 1 hit in the United States and received an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Song]]. When Daniel and Miyagi are being driven by Chozen and his crony Toshio after they arrive in Okinawa, Chozen tunes in the radio of the car until he reaches a station playing \"Fascination\", the same song to which Ali and Johnny were slow dancing at the high-end country club in the original film.
