It tells the story of Eric \"The Kid\" Stoner, a young [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era [[poker]] player, as he seeks to establish his reputation as the best. This quest leads him to challenge Lancey \"The Man\" Howard, an older player widely considered to be the best, culminating in a climactic final poker hand between the two.\n\nThe script, adapted from [[Richard Jessup]]'s novel of the same name, was written by [[Ring Lardner Jr.]] and [[Terry Southern]]; it was Lardner's first major studio work since his [[Hollywood blacklist|1947 blacklisting]] as one of [[Hollywood blacklist#The Hollywood Ten|The Hollywood Ten]].<ref name=\"fn98n8\">{{cite web | first =Steven | last =Hartman | title =Film Notes: Cincinnati Kid | work =New York State Writers Institute Film Notes | publisher =[[University at Albany]] | url =http://www.albany.edu/writers-inst/webpages4/filmnotes/fnf98n8.html | access-date =2009-01-19 | archive-date =2011-08-29 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110829220659/http://www.albany.edu/writers-inst/webpages4/filmnotes/fnf98n8.html | url-status =live }}</ref> The film stars [[Steve McQueen]] in the title role and [[Edward G. Robinson]] as Howard. Director Jewison, who replaced [[Sam Peckinpah]] shortly after filming began,<ref name=\"fn98n8\"/> describes ''The Cincinnati Kid'' as his \"ugly duckling\" film. He considers it the film that allowed him to transition from the lighter comedic films he had previously been making and take on more serious films and subjects.<ref name=\"DirectorCommentary\">{{cite video|people =Jewison, Norman|title =The Cincinnati Kid director commentary | date = 2005 | medium =DVD| publisher =Turner Entertainment}}</ref>\n\nThe film garnered mixed reviews from critics on its initial release; supporting actors Robinson and [[Joan Blondell]] earned award nominations for their performances.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 1930s Eric Stoner, nicknamed \"The Kid\", is an up-and-coming poker player in [[New Orleans]]. He hears that Lancey Howard, a longtime master of the game nicknamed \"The Man\", is in town, and sees it as his chance to finally become the Man himself. The Kid's friend Shooter cautions him, reminding the Kid how Shooter thought he was the best [[five-card stud]] player in the world, until Howard \"gutted\" him when they played.\n\nHoward arranges a game with wealthy and corrupt William Jefferson Slade, who secures Shooter's services as dealer. Howard wins $6,000 from Slade over a 30-hour game, angering Slade and wounding his pride. That night at Slade's home, he tries to bribe Shooter into cheating in the Kid's favor when the two players meet. Shooter declines, but Slade calls in Shooter's [[IOU|markers]] worth $12,000, and blackmails him by threatening to reveal damaging information about Shooter's sleazy wife, Melba. Shooter agonizes over his decision, having spent the last 25 years building a reputation for integrity.\n\nWith the Kid's girl Christian visiting her parents, Melba tries to seduce him, even though she and Christian are close friends. Out of respect for Shooter, he rebuffs her, and spends the day before the game with Christian at her family's farm.\n\nThe Kid intentionally arrives late to the game. The big game starts with six players, including Howard and the Kid, with Shooter playing as he deals and Lady Fingers relieving him whenever Shooter needs a break. In the first big confrontation between the Kid and Howard, the Kid is short $2,000 and Slade steps in to stake him. Several hours later, Howard busts a player called Pig, perhaps with a bluff, and the remaining players take a break. Following the break, Lady Fingers, who has been delighting in needling Howard all evening, takes over as dealer and continues to needle him.\n\nAs the game wears on, Shooter only deals, and then after another hand when Howard outplays them, two more players, Yeller and Sokal, drop out. That leaves just Howard and the Kid. After a few unlikely wins, the Kid calls for a break and confronts Shooter, who admits to being forced into cheating by Slade. The Kid insists he can win on his own and tells Shooter to deal straight or he will blow the whistle, destroying Shooter's reputation. Before the game resumes, Melba succeeds in seducing the Kid. Christian makes a surprise visit to the room, catches them after the fact and walks out on the Kid.\n\nSlade tells the Kid that Shooter will continue to cheat for him and confronts him with a menacing thug, but the Kid flatly refuses. Back at the game, the Kid maneuvers to have Shooter replaced by Lady Fingers, lying that Shooter is ill. He then wins several major pots from Howard, who is visibly losing confidence.\n\nDuring the final hand Howard beats the Kid with a queen-high straight flush. The Kid turns over his cards to show he has a full house, aces full of tens. This loss devastates the Kid, who not only loses all his money in this final hand, but also an additional $5,000 raise from Howard which the Kid called before Howard showed his hand. Howard then mocks the Kid, telling him that he will always be \"second best\" as long as Howard is around. As the Kid leaves the table, he is ridiculed by both Slade and Melba, and consoled by Shooter.\n\nFollowing the game, the Kid leaves the hotel and loses a [[pitching pennies|penny pitch]] to the shoe shine boy he had beaten at the same game at the film's opening. Around the corner, he runs into Christian and they embrace.\n\n===Alternative versions===\nIn some cuts, the film ends with a [[Freeze-frame shot|freeze-frame]] on Steve McQueen's face following his penny-pitching loss. [[Turner Classic Movies]] and the DVD feature the ending with Christian.

Holden states that the chances of both such hands appearing in one deal are \"a laughable\" 332,220,508,619 to 1 (more than 332 billion to 1 against) and goes on: \"If these two played 50 hands of stud an hour, eight hours a day, five days a week, the situation would arise about once every 443 years.\"  Nevertheless, the nature of probability is that even if something is possible, however unlikely, it nevertheless might happen, and therefore is certainly not an impossibility.  The movie reflects that truth - if something is possible, it may possibly happen whatever the odds. Despite Holden's statement, such a hand is exactly as likely to appear on the first day as it might be in the 222nd day of the 443rd year.\n\n==Release==\nThe world premiere was held at the [[Saenger Theatre (New Orleans)|Saenger Theatre]] in New Orleans on October 15, 1965, with a nationwide release on October 27.

''Kid'' also has a less compelling subplot. Away from the table, McQueen gambles on a blonde (Tuesday Weld) and on the integrity of his dealer pal, Karl Malden. Pressure comes from a conventionally vicious Southern gentleman (Rip Torn), whose pleasures include a Negro mistress, a pistol range adjacent to his parlor, and fixed card games. As Malden's wife, Ann-Margret spells trouble of another kind, though her naive impersonation of a wicked, wicked woman recalls the era when the femme fatale wore breastplates lashed together with spider web. By the time all the bets are in, ''Cincinnati Kid'' appears to hold a losing hand.</blockquote>\n\nA retrospective review published by the New York State Writers Institute of the [[University at Albany]] also noted the similarities the film had to ''The Hustler'', but in contrast said ''The Cincinnati Kid''{{-'}}s \"stylized realism, dreamlike color, and detailed subplots give [the film] a dramatic complexity and self-awareness that ''The Hustler'' lacks.\"<ref name=\"fn98n8\"/>\n\nBlondell was singled out for her performance as Lady Fingers with an award from the [[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]] and a [[23rd Golden Globe Awards#Best Supporting Actress|Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress]].
