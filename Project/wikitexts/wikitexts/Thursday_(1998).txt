It won the Special Jury Prize at the [[Festival du Film Policier de Cognac|Cognac Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn Monday night, Nick, Dallas, and Billy Hill argue with a [[Los Angeles]] convenience store cashier, resulting in Dallas shooting her dead. They conceal the killing from a police officer until he sees blood on the floor, at which point they kill him.\n\nEarly Thursday morning, in [[Texas]], Casey receives a call from his old drug dealing partner Nick asking to stay a couple of days. Since they parted ways several years previously, Casey has cleaned up, married, and is hoping to adopt a child. Nick borrows Casey's car, and Casey finds Nick's suitcase to be full of [[heroin]]. Furious, he calls Nick and gives an [[ultimatum]] in which Nick either leaves or Casey calls the cops. Nick promises he'll be along once he has finished some business. Casey puts the heroin down his [[garbage disposal unit]].\n\nAt 11:55, Casey answers the door to hitman Ice. Casey asks that they smoke some [[cannabis (drug)|ganja]] together before he dies, then takes advantage of a distraction. Ice ends up gagged and bound in Casey's garage just as Dr. Jarvis, the adoption agent, rings the doorbell. Casey, stoned, rushes to clear away the drug paraphernalia before letting Jarvis in to discuss his suitability to adopt. Jarvis expresses curiosity about what Casey did when he lived in Los Angeles, as there is no account of his time there. Casey tries his best to cover up his past as well as his recent encounter with Ice.\n\nDuring the interview, Dallas shows up at Casey's house, believing that Nick has left some money with Casey along with the heroin. She scares Jarvis away by telling a story about Casey's criminal past. When left alone with Casey, Dallas questions him about the money. Angry that he cannot help her, she decides to kill him, but not before she ties him to a chair, [[fellatio|fellates]] him to force an erection, then proceeds to [[rape]] him. Dallas says she will not kill Casey until he [[orgasm]]s and plans to continue until he does so. She orgasms multiple times, but gets no results from Casey. While Dallas reaches a third orgasm, Billy breaks in and shoots her.\n\nBilly believes Casey when told that he has not taken the heroin, but plans on torturing him anyway with a saw and a [[blowtorch]]. Billy is interrupted by cops raiding the house next door. As Billy is distracted, Casey is able to loosen the tape around his wrists and grabs a frying pan before he sits back down. When Billy returns, Casey catches him off guard, overpowers him, and leaves him in the garage.\n\nNick calls Casey from a [[payphone]], apologizes for everything, and admits he had stolen the heroin and money from the police. After he hangs up, it is revealed that Nick has been shot and is dying from blood loss. Finally, corrupt cop Kasarov arrives with a bag which contains Nick's head. He gives Casey until 7 p.m. to find the money, but says that he does not care about the heroin. Upon seeing Dallas's body and Ice and Billy in the garage, Kasarov unloads his gun into the latter two. He tells Casey to throw them out, as it is garbage day.\n\nCasey calls Ice's boss and tells him that the heroin is being auctioned off at 7 p.m. at his house, setting up a gun battle between a Jamaican gang and Kasarov's corrupt cops. Casey recalls Nick's earlier words, which lead him to find the money and a wedding present in the spare tire of his car. He takes them, puts them in Dallas's [[Lamborghini]], and leaves to pick his wife up at the airport.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Thomas Jane]] as Casey Wells\n* [[Aaron Eckhart]] as Nick\n* [[Paulina Porizkova]] as Dallas\n* [[James LeGros]] as Billy Hill\n* [[Paula Marshall]] as Christine\n* [[Michael Jeter]] as Dr. Jarvis\n* [[Glenn Plummer]] as Ice\n* [[Mickey Rourke]] as Detective Kasarov\n* [[Shawn Michael Howard]] as Jimmy\n* [[Gary Dourdan]] as Lester \"Ball-peen\" James\n* Luck Hari as Cashier\n* Bari K.

[[Roger Ebert]] of the Chicago Sun-Times detested both the film and the director, dismissing it as \"a series of geek-show sequences in which characters are tortured, raped, murdered and dismembered in between passages of sexist and racist language\", and stating that \"watching it, I felt outrage. I saw a movie so reprehensible I couldn't rationalize it using the standard critical language about style, genre, or irony. The people associated with it should be ashamed of themselves.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/festivals-and-awards/thursday-director-thinks-its-hip-to-offend|title='Thursday' director thinks it's hip to offend &#124; Festivals & Awards &#124; Roger Ebert}}</ref> On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] it has a 43% approval rating, based on 7 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/thursday/ |title=Thursday |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher= |access-date=May 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\nAt the '''[[Cognac Festival du Film Policier]]''' the film won the 1999 Special Jury Prize (tied with ''[[A Simple Plan (film)|A Simple Plan]]'').\n\nIt was nominated for an '''[[Artios Award]]''' in the category of Best Casting of an Independent Feature Film.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0124901|title=Thursday}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=thursday|title=Thursday}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071224070345/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/173819/Thursday/trailers ''Thursday trailer''] at [[NY Times]]\n\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:PolyGram Filmed Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:1998 crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:1990s black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Skip Woods]]\n[[Category:1998 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1998 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
