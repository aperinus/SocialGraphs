This was the first of many films that Segal has filmed with former ''SNL'' castmates. It tells the story of a socially and emotionally immature man (Farley) who learns lessons about friendship and self-worth, following the sudden death of his industrialist father.\n\nThe film was shot primarily in [[Toronto]] and [[Los Angeles]] under the working title \"Rocky Road\". ''Tommy Boy'' grossed $32.7 million on a budget of $20 million. The film received mixed reviews from critics.<ref name=\"tomatoes\" /> Since its release, ''Tommy Boy'' has become a [[cult film|cult classic]] and been successful on home video.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdfile.com/reviews/blurayreviews/24591-tommy-boy-bd |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120730220402/http://www.dvdfile.com/reviews/blurayreviews/24591-tommy-boy-bd |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 30, 2012 |title=Tommy Boy \u2013 BD |access-date=September 7, 2011 |work=DVDFile.com |first=Dan |last=Ramer}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/12/23/tommy-boy-blu-ray-review |title=Tommy Boy Blu-ray Review |access-date=April 10, 2018 |work=[[IGN]] |first=Jenna |last=Busch |date=December 23, 2008 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}</ref>\n\n''Tommy Boy'' and the 1994 horror film ''[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare]]'' are dedicated to Gregg Fonseca (1952\u20131994), who died eight months before the release of ''Tommy Boy''. While Fonseca did not work on either film, he served as production designer on the first two ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (film series)|Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' films, as well as ''[[Coneheads]]'' and both ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]] films'' which, like ''Tommy Boy'', were produced by Lorne Michaels.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter seven years at college, Thomas R. \"Tommy\" Callahan III barely graduates from [[Marquette University]] and returns to his hometown of [[Sandusky, Ohio]]. His father, industrialist and widower Thomas R. \"Big Tom\" Callahan Jr., gives him an executive job at the family's auto parts plant, Callahan Auto. In addition to the new job and office, Big Tom reveals that he plans to marry Beverly Barrish-Burns, a woman he had met at a [[Weight loss camp|fat farm]], and that her son, Paul, will become Tommy's new stepbrother. However, Big Tom dies from a sudden [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] during the wedding reception. After the funeral, doubting the future of the company without Big Tom, the bank reneges on promises of a loan for a new [[brake pad]] division and seeks immediate payment of Callahan Auto's debts. Tommy suggests a deal: he will let the bank hold his few inherited shares and house in exchange for the bank giving time to sell enough brake pads to prove the new division's viability. If enough brake pads are sold by the deadline, the bank will grant the loan. Tommy then sets out on a cross-country sales trip with Big Tom's scornful assistant, Richard Hayden, a childhood acquaintance who is not only annoyed over Tommy's immaturity and poor work ethic, but believes it was he, Richard, who should have replaced Big Tom as corporate head.\n\nMeanwhile, Beverly and Paul are shown kissing romantically. They are revealed to be not mother and son, but rather married [[confidence trick|con artist]]s with criminal records. Instead of eventually suing for divorce and taking half of Big Tom's estate, Beverly has inherited controlling interest in the company. To turn that into cash, she seeks a quick sale to self-described \"auto parts king\" Ray Zalinsky. On the road, Tommy's [[social anxiety]] and [[hyperactivity]] alienate several potential buyers. The lack of any progress leads to tension between Tommy and Richard. When all hope seems lost, Tommy persuades a surly waitress to serve him after the kitchen has closed and Richard suggests he use his skill at reading people to make sales. The two make amends and quickly reach their sales goal. However, Paul sabotages the company's computers, causing sales posted by sales manager Michelle Brock to be either lost or rerouted. With half of the sales now canceled, the bank (now backed by Beverly and Paul) decides to sell Callahan Auto to Zalinsky. Hoping that they can persuade Zalinsky to reconsider, Tommy and Richard board a plane to [[Chicago]] posing as flight attendants. In Chicago, they get a brief meeting with Zalinsky, but he tells them he wants only the reputation connected with the Callahan brand and will close down the company and lay off its workers.\n\nTommy and Richard are denied entrance to the Zalinsky board room since Tommy has no standing. As they wallow on the curb in [[self-pity]], Michelle arrives with Paul and Beverly's police records. Tommy devises a plan: dressed as a [[suicide bomber]] by using road flares, he attracts the attention of a live television news crew and then, along with Michelle and Richard, forces his way back into the board room. Back in Sandusky, Callahan workers watch the drama on [[television]]. In a final move of pure persuasion, Tommy quotes Zalinsky's own advertising slogan, that he is on the side of the \"American working man.\" As the television audience watches, Zalinsky signs Tommy's purchase order for 500,000 brake pads. Although Zalinsky says that the purchase order is meaningless as he will soon own Callahan Auto, Michelle shows the police records, which includes Paul's [[Warrant (law)|outstanding warrants]] for [[fraud]]. Since Beverly is still married to Paul, her marriage to Big Tom was [[bigamy|bigamous]] and therefore never legal. Thus, all of Big Tom's controlling shares actually belong to Tommy, the rightful heir. Since Tommy does not want to sell the shares, the deal with Zalinsky is off, and since Tommy still holds Zalinsky's purchase order, the company is saved. Paul attempts to escape but is arrested. Zalinsky admits that Tommy outplayed him and invites Beverly to dinner. Tommy is appointed the president of Callahan Auto, becomes friends with Richard, and starts a romance with Michelle.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Chris Farley]] as Thomas \"Tommy\" Callahan III\n** Clinton Turnbull as Young Tommy\n* [[David Spade]] as Richard Hayden\n** [[Ryder Britton]] as Young Richard\n* [[Bo Derek]] as Beverly Burns-Barrish, Tommy's stepmother\n* [[Julie Warner]] as Michelle Brock\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Ray Zalinsky\n* [[Brian Dennehy]] as Thomas \"Big Tom\" Callahan Jr., Tommy's father\n* [[Sean McCann (actor)|Sean McCann]] as Frank Rittenhauer\n* [[Zach Grenier]] as Ted Reilly\n* [[James Blendick]] as Ron Gilmore\n* [[Rob Lowe]] as Paul Barrish, Tommy's older stepbrother (uncredited)\n* [[William Patterson Dunlop]] as R.T.\n* [[David Hemblen]] as Archer\n* [[Maria Vacratsis]] as Helen\n* [[Colin Fox (actor)|Colin Fox]] as Ted Nelson\n* [[Jonathan Wilson (actor)|Jonathan Wilson]] as Marty\n* [[Lorri Bagley]] as Woman in Pool\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Tommy Boy'' opened on March 31, 1995, and grossed $8 million in its opening weekend, finishing first at the box office.
