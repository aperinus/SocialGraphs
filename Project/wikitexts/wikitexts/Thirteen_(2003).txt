Loosely based on Reed's life from ages 12 to 13, the film's plot follows Tracy, a seventh grade student in [[Los Angeles]] who begins dabbling in substance abuse, sex and crime after being befriended by a troubled classmate. It features [[Brady Corbet]], [[Deborah Kara Unger]], [[Kip Pardue]] and [[Vanessa Hudgens]] (in her film debut) in supporting roles.\n\nThe screenplay for ''Thirteen'' was written over a period of six days by Hardwicke and the then-14-year-old Reed; Hardwicke, a former production designer, independently raised funds herself for the production. Filming took place on location in Los Angeles in 2002, largely shot with [[hand-held camera]]s.\n\nUpon the film's debut at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2003, Hardwicke won the Sundance Directing (Drama) for the film. [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] subsequently acquired ''Thirteen'' for distribution, giving the film a limited release in the United States beginning on August 20, 2003; the release would expand in September 2003 and the film went on to gross a total of $4.6 million at the U.S. box office.\n\nThough it received numerous favorable reviews from critics, ''Thirteen'' generated some controversy for its depiction of youth drug use (including [[inhalant]]s, [[marijuana]], [[LSD]] and [[Alcohol abuse|alcohol]]), [[Child sexuality|underage sexual behavior]], and [[self-harm]].<ref name=\"cnn\">{{cite web |author=Leopold, Todd |date=August 25, 2003 |title=Director: 'Thirteen' is 'one kid's story' |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Movies/08/25/sprj.cas03.qa.hardwicke/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210828153846/http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Movies/08/25/sprj.cas03.qa.hardwicke/ |archive-date=August 28, 2021 |access-date=April 24, 2018 |work=[[CNN]]}}</ref> The film earned Hunter an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] and [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] nominations for Hunter and Wood for Best Supporting Actress and Best Actress in a Drama, respectively.\n\n==Plot==\n13-year-old Tracy Freeland begins her school year as a smart and mild-mannered [[honors student]] at a middle school in [[Los Angeles]]. Her divorced mother Melanie is a recovering [[alcoholic]], who struggles to support Tracy and her older brother Mason by working as a hairdresser. Tracy feels ignored by her mother, who is too busy with her fellow ex-addict boyfriend Brady to address Tracy's increasing depression. On the first day of 7th grade, Tracy encounters Evie Zamora, the most popular girl in Tracy\u2019s class. After being teased by Evie\u2019s crew for her \"[[Cabbage Patch Kids|Cabbage Patch]]\" clothes, Tracy is mortified and decides to shed her \"little girl\" image. At a store (owned by Melanie\u2019s friend), Tracy happily finds trendier clothes as Melanie offers a few dollars in change as payment.  \n\nThe following day Tracy wears one of her new outfits to school. At lunch she sits near and observes Evie, eventually seeing Evie leave for the bathroom and following her. Evie, seemingly realizing Tracy is following her, compliments Tracy\u2019s new outfit. Tracy in turn compliments Evie. After a quick once over, Evie invites Tracy to go shopping on [[Melrose Avenue]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], writing her phone number down on an address pad Tracy provides.\n\nExcited and hopeful, Tracy calls the number after school, but after two attempts realizes that Evie gave her a fake phone number to prank her. Nevertheless, Tracy determinedly shows up on Melrose Avenue and meets with Evie and her friend Astrid. Evie and Astrid seem surprised and amused that Tracy showed up, laughing at her as soon as she arrives. Tracy witnesses the two shoplifting and excuses herself from the store. She sits outside on a bench and moments later a distracted woman sits next to her. The woman's purse falls open, revealing her wallet, which Tracy takes. She finds Evie and Astrid and, elated, the three go on a shopping spree with the stolen money.\n\nAfter, Tracy returns home and realizes that Melanie has invited Brady over for dinner that night. A flashback shows Brady violently withdrawing from drugs, a scene that traumatized Tracy.\n\nTracy and Evie become inseparable. Evie introduces Tracy to her world of sex, drugs, and crime, much to Tracy's delight. Evie tells Melanie that Brooke, her adult cousin and guardian, is out of town for two weeks, and Melanie agrees to let her stay at her home with Tracy. While staying there, Evie discovers that Tracy regularly [[Self-mutilation|cuts herself]] to cope with stress. Although Melanie is concerned about the change in Tracy's behavior and worries about the extent of Evie's influence, she cannot find a way to intervene. Melanie attempts to send Evie home, but reluctantly lets her stay after Evie claims her guardian's boyfriend is physically abusive. As Tracy and Evie become closer, Tracy shuts Melanie further out of her life.\n\nEvie and Tracy get increasingly out of control, each egging the other on. The pair attempt to seduce Tracy's neighbor Luke, a lifeguard in his early twenties, and ditch a family movie night to get high on the streets in Hollywood. Mason is shocked when he bumps into Tracy wearing sexualized clothing, including [[thong]] underwear, but Tracy dismisses his concerns. Later on, the girls take turns [[Inhalant abuse|inhaling]] from a can of [[gas duster]] for electronics and become so intoxicated that they start hitting and punching each other.\n\nMelanie attempts to break the girls' friendship by sending Tracy to live with her father, a preoccupied businessman, but he refuses. After Evie's stay extends over two weeks, Melanie unsuccessfully attempts to contact Brooke, and then visits Brooke's home with Evie and Tracy. They find that Brooke was hiding because of a botched plastic surgery. Evie asks Melanie to formally adopt her but Melanie refuses. Tracy meekly supports her mother's decision. Angry and hurt, a tearful Evie storms off. Later at school, Evie turns her friends against Tracy, and Tracy slowly begins to realize the negative effects of her lifestyle when she is told that she will have to repeat the seventh grade.\n\nWhile walking home from school, Brady offers Tracy a ride and takes her home where Melanie, Evie, and Brooke are sitting quietly in the living room waiting for her. Brooke confronts Tracy about her drug use and stealing, having been convinced that Tracy was the bad influence on Evie. Outraged, Tracy insists that Evie was the instigator, but the skeptical Brooke refuses to listen and announces that she is moving Evie to [[Ojai, California|Ojai]] to keep her away from Tracy. Melanie defends Tracy's innocence but then Brooke pulls Tracy's sleeve up to show Melanie Tracy's self-harm scars. After a screaming match, Brooke and Evie leave. Tracy weeps in Melanie's arms and attempts to fight against her mother's embrace. She tearfully pleads with Melanie to let go, but Melanie persists and the two fall asleep together on Tracy's bed. The last scene shows a dream sequence of Tracy spinning alone and screaming on a park [[merry-go-round]] during the daytime.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Tracy Freeland\n* [[Nikki Reed]] as Evie Zamora\n* [[Holly Hunter]] as Melanie Freeland\n* [[Jeremy Sisto]] as Brady\n* [[Brady Corbet]] as Mason Freeland\n* [[Deborah Kara Unger]] as Brooke LaLaine\n* [[Sarah Clarke]] as Birdie\n* [[Vanessa Hudgens]] as Noel\n* [[Kip Pardue]] as Luke\n* [[D.

It's extremely raw, it was not a filled-in picture. It felt more like a feeling than anything else. And that's unusual for a script to communicate like that.

The Freeland home scenes were shot at a rented house in the [[San Fernando Valley]]. The outdoor school scenes were shot at [[Portola Middle School (Tarzana)|Portola Middle School]] in [[Tarzana, Los Angeles|Tarzana, California]].\n\nSome scenes in the film were carefully and colorfully lit, while others were shot only with whatever daylight could be had. Due to [[Child labour law|child labor laws]], the underage performers were only allowed to work a regulated number of hours per day.<ref name=cheng/> This made for a frenetic production atmosphere, which cast and crew later said matched the script and added to the film's fast and emotionally taut pace. The film stock was transferred to the digital domain wherein the colors and saturation were highly manipulated for some segments.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> The beginning of the film was very slightly desaturated in the scenes before Tracy became friends with Evie. Once they became friends, the saturation was increased to a \"glowy\" effect, according to Hardwicke. After the scene where Evie and Tracy make out with Luke, the saturation slowly becomes less and less until the end of the film, especially after Evie is told that she can't live with Tracy anymore and Tracy is abandoned by the popular group.\n\nThe wardrobe worn by the girls was mostly their own. As filming progressed, the girls began dressing similarly without being asked to do so. The girls did not take any dangerous substances during the film. They are shown smoking cigarettes, but these were filled mostly with [[catnip]]. The crushed pills they are shown snorting from the cover of a children's book were harmless dietary supplements.\n\nAll of the scenes in which Tracy cut herself were shot in a single day; Wood recalled running to her brother for emotional support between some takes. Wood later described the shooting of the two make out scenes with Javi and Luke as \"awkward\" because her family was watching behind the scenes. Wood's mother requested that in the scenes with Tracy's bra exposed, that the front of her not be seen on camera. The whole scene with Luke was rendered in a single, long and uncut take with Wood, Reed and Pardue, but was tightly choreographed with several crew members, social workers and parents also in the small room, carefully staying either hidden or behind the camera as it panned more than 200\u00b0, showing all four walls.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Thirteen'' was picked up by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] after production was completed.<ref name=\"lee\">{{cite web |author=Lee, Linda |date=August 24, 2003 |title='Thirteen' as Therapy With an Upright Couch |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/24/style/thirteen-as-therapy-with-an-upright-couch.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308124945/https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/24/style/thirteen-as-therapy-with-an-upright-couch.html |archive-date=March 8, 2021 |access-date=April 23, 2018 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> The film debuted at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 17, 2003.<ref name=rochlin/><ref>{{cite web|work=[[Getty Images]]|url=https://www.gettyimages.fr/detail/photo-d'actualit\u00e9/actress-holly-hunter-arriving-at-the-screening-for-photo-dactualit\u00e9/2335781#actress-holly-hunter-arriving-at-the-screening-for-thirteen-at-the-picture-id2335781|access-date=April 23, 2018|title=2003 Sundance Film Festival - 'Thirteen' Screening|date=January 17, 2003}}</ref> In the United States, it was given a limited release on August 20, 2003 in New York City, followed by its Los Angeles premiere on August 22.<ref name=afi>{{cite web|work=[[American Film Institute]]|title=Thirteen (2003)|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/62919|access-date=December 28, 2017}}</ref> At the film's premiere screenings in [[Manhattan]], brochures for [[Drug Abuse Resistance Education]] (D.A.R.E.) were distributed.<ref name=lee/>\n\nDuring its opening weekend, the film earned $116,260 at the U.S. box office, showing on 5 screens.<ref name=bom>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=thirteen.htm|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|title=Thirteen (2003)|access-date=April 24, 2018}}</ref> Its release expanded to 243 theaters on September 19, 2003, and it went on to gross a total of $4,601,043 in the United States before concluding its theatrical run on December 18, 2003.<ref name=bom/> In international markets, it grossed a further $5,527,917, making for a worldwide gross of $10.1 million.<ref name=bom/>\n\n===Critical response===\nFilm critic [[Roger Ebert]] awarded the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, writing: \"Who is this movie for?
