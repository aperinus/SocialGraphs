It grossed $86&nbsp;million worldwide against a production budget of {{no wrap|$20\u201330 million}}. A sequel, ''[[John Wick: Chapter 2]]'', was released in 2017, and was met with comparable critical and commercial success.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nAfter losing his wife, Helen, to a terminal illness, [[John Wick (character)|John Wick]] receives a [[beagle]] puppy named Daisy that Helen had arranged to send before she died, to help him cope with his grief. Despite John's stoic demeanor, he bonds with the puppy and they spend the day driving around in his vintage 1969 [[Ford Mustang Mach 1]]. At a gas station, he encounters a trio of Russian gangsters whose leader Iosef insists on buying his car, which John refuses to sell or be cowed by Iosef's attempts at intimidation. That evening, the gangsters break into John's home, knock him unconscious, kill Daisy, and steal his car. Iosef takes the Mustang to a [[chop shop]] to have the [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN]] changed. Aurelio, the shop's owner, recognizing the car and knowing who it was stolen from, punches Iosef and ejects him from the facility. John visits Aurelio, who identifies Iosef as the son of Viggo Tarasov, the head of the [[Russian mafia]] in [[New York City]].\n\nAurelio relays Iosef's activities to Viggo, who attacks and berates Iosef before explaining to him that John Wick was formerly in Viggo's employ as an [[Contract killing|enforcer]] nicknamed \"[[Baba Yaga]].\" When John wanted to retire and marry Helen, Viggo gave him an \"impossible task,\" implied to involve multiple high-level assassinations in a short period of time. To Viggo's surprise, John succeeded, and his efforts were key in establishing the Tarasov syndicate. After warning Iosef of his impending doom, Viggo tries to talk John out of seeking retribution, but John refuses to talk. Viggo sends a team of hitmen to John's house, but John kills all of them and enlists an [[Fixer (crime)|underworld cleaning service]] to dispose of the bodies and evidence. Unsurprised, Viggo places a $2 million [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] on John's head and personally offers the contract to John's mentor, Marcus, who accepts. John seeks assistance from the New York Continental Hotel, which caters exclusively to the criminal underworld and permits no assassinations (termed \"business\" in their language) on its premises. Viggo doubles the bounty for those willing to break this rule to kill John.\n\nWinston, the Continental's manager, informs John that Viggo has Iosef under guard at his Red Circle [[nightclub]]. John enters the Red Circle and kills a horde of Viggo's men to reach Iosef, who narrowly escapes after Viggo's lieutenant Kirill thwarts his attempt and incapacitates John. John retreats to the Continental to have his injuries treated. Ms. Perkins, an assassin and acquaintance, sneaks into John's room to kill him. Marcus alerts John with a warning shot, allowing him to subdue Perkins, who reveals the location of Viggo's [[front organization|front]]. He knocks her unconscious and leaves her with Harry, a fellow assassin, to await punishment, but she later frees herself and kills Harry. John travels to a church in [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn|Little Russia]], which serves as Viggo's front and destroys his cache of money and [[blackmail]] material. When Viggo and his henchmen arrive, John ambushes them, but is subdued and captured.\n\nIgnoring John\u2019s demands to surrender Iosef, Viggo taunts John for thinking that he would be able to leave his old life behind. Before John can be killed, Marcus intervenes again, allowing John to free himself, strangle Kirill to death, and accost Viggo, who reveals Iosef's location. John then travels to Iosef's [[Brooklyn]] [[safe house]] and kills him and his [[bodyguard]]s. Perkins learns that John and Marcus have been in contact and informs Viggo, who has Marcus beaten and tortured briefly before killing him in his home. Viggo calls John to report this, planning to have Perkins ambush him. While waiting for John, Perkins is summoned to a meeting with Winston, who has her executed for breaking the Continental's rules. Winston calls John to inform him that Viggo is planning to escape by helicopter. John races to [[New York Harbor]], where he kills Viggo's remaining [[henchmen]] before battling Viggo on the dock. Viggo brandishes a knife, and John allows himself to be stabbed before disarming and wounding Viggo, leaving him to die. John breaks into an animal clinic to treat his wounds and releases a [[pit bull]] puppy scheduled to be euthanized. John and the dog walk home along the [[boardwalk]] where he had his final date with Helen.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[John Wick (character)|Jardani Jovanovich / Johnathan \"John\" Wick]]:<br /> A former hitman who returns to the underworld he fought to leave behind.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.yahoo.com/movies/mess-with-keanus-puppy-at-your-peril-in-blazing-97633834091.html|title=Mess With Keanu Reeves' Puppy At Your Peril In Blazing John Wick Trailer|publisher=[[Yahoo]]|access-date=September 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140919232713/https://uk.yahoo.com/movies/mess-with-keanus-puppy-at-your-peril-in-blazing-97633834091.html|archive-date=September 19, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"lionsgate-productionnotes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lionsgatepublicity.com/uploads/assets/JOHN%20WICK%20FINAL%20Production%20Notes.pdf |title=John Wick PRODUCTION NOTES |publisher=[[Lionsgate]] |access-date=October 22, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129041940/http://www.lionsgatepublicity.com/uploads/assets/JOHN%20WICK%20FINAL%20Production%20Notes.pdf |archive-date=November 29, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> On accepting the role of Wick, Reeves explained, \"Basil and Peter Lawson of Thunder Road brought the script to me with the idea that I would be a part of such a great collaboration.
