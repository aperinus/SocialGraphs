However, Aniston's dramatic performance received positive reviews and brought her a nomination at the [[Golden Globe Awards]] and another at the [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|film|date=April 2020}}\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nA year after surviving a car accident that killed her son, former attorney Claire Bennett struggles with chronic pain, making her angry. Silvana, her housekeeper, caretaker and chauffeur, looks after all of her needs. Since the accident, Claire rides lying down while Silvana drives her everywhere.\n\nHer pain medication abuse stems from not accepting her son's death (for which she feels responsible), and the [[suicide]] of Nina, a member of her chronic pain support group. Claire distances herself from her husband Jason, eventually asking him to move out. She leaves the support group after describing Nina's suicide in detail. Addicted to alcohol and to the [[opioid]]s [[percocet]] and [[oxycontin]], she eventually has to resort to buying the drugs illegally in [[Tijuana]]. She dreams vividly and hallucinates about Nina.\n\nAt her pool [[physical therapy]] Claire is uncooperative; her physical therapist informs the doctor she hasn't improved in six months, meaning her pain medication could get cut off. After her session, Claire jumps into the pool with body weights, seemingly to kill herself. She stays on the bottom for a long time before rising to the surface.\n \nAt the threat of a lawsuit, Annette (the support group leader) gives Claire Nina's home address. Claire goes to the house, telling the occupant a lie about having lived there as a child.  Nina's husband Roy, however, was tipped off by Annette and confronts her as she is leaving. She asks him what he would say to his wife now. He responds that he hates Nina for ruining his life and that of their son Casey. Bonding over their loss and isolation, Claire and Roy go to Nina's grave, where he hangs a [[wind chime]]. A few nights later Claire surprises him at home and takes Nina's leftover Percocet. Nina returns in Claire's dreams, chastising her for using people.\n\nDuring lunch with Roy and Casey, the man responsible for Claire's car accident shows up at her house to apologize, racked with guilt. She physically attacks him, releasing some of her pent-up anger. Afterwards, she inadvertently overdoses on the pain medication; realizing what has happened, she forces herself to vomit before passing out. Taken to the hospital, she dreams of Nina presenting her with a birthday cake with six lit candles, explaining that she feels guilty about not being able to make a homemade birthday cake for her son.\n\nClaire is discharged from the hospital and struggles to remain drug free.  She asks Silvana to drive her to [[Riverside, California|Riverside]] drive-in, where she had her first date with Jason. Wandering away, she lies down on the nearby railroad tracks and hallucinates a conversation with Nina, who gets Claire to admit she was a good mother. Claire hears Silvana calling her and when she gets up, Nina vanishes. Silvana, in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], loudly criticizes Claire for abusing everyone and pushing away Jason, who is also suffering the loss of their son. She is interrupted when Claire notices the car has been stolen, forcing them to stay in a motel and get a rental to return to LA the next day.\n\nThe next day Becky, a girl from [[Idaho]] on her way to LA, tries to steal Claire's purse. Claire brings her home to make her a homemade cake. Silvana later wakes Claire when she sees Becky has in fact stolen the purse, but has left a beautiful cake. Claire takes it to Roy for his son's birthday, as a way of thanking Nina. She and Silvana go to visit her son's grave, where Silvana hangs a wind chime in a nearby tree. On the ride home, Claire finally sits upright in the car.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n\n* [[Jennifer Aniston]] as Claire Bennett\n* [[Adriana Barraza]] as Silvana\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Nina Collins\n* [[Sam Worthington]] as Roy Collins\n* [[Mamie Gummer]] as Bonnie\n* [[Felicity Huffman]] as Annette\n* [[William H.
