It stars [[Alec Baldwin]], supported by [[John Lone]], [[Penelope Ann Miller]], [[Peter Boyle]], [[Ian McKellen]], [[Jonathan Winters]], and [[Tim Curry]]. The film is based on [[The Shadow|the pulp fiction character of the same name]] created in 1931 by [[Walter B. Gibson]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Baldwin's 'Shadow' Achieves Pale Silhouette Of Its Potential |publisher= [[Orlando Sentinel]]|url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-07-01/entertainment/9406300802_1_shiwan-khan-david-koepp-shadow|access-date=January 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe film was released to theaters on July 1, 1994, received mixed reviews, and was a commercial failure.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing the [[World War I|First World War]], Lamont Cranston sets himself up as a drug kingpin and warlord in Tibet. The [[Tulku]], a holy man who exhibits otherworldly powers, abducts Cranston and offers him a chance to become a force for good. Cranston initially refuses and is attacked by the Tulku's [[Phurba]], a mystical flying dagger. Ultimately, Cranston becomes the Tulku's student and learns how to [[Hypnosis|hypnotize]] others and bend their perceptions so that he becomes invisible, save for his shadow.\n\nCranston returns to [[New York City]] seven years later and resumes his former life as a wealthy playboy, while secretly operating as The Shadow\u2014a vigilante who terrorizes the city's underworld. He recruits some of those he saves from criminals to act as his agents, providing him with information and specialist knowledge. His identity is largely unknown, especially to his Uncle Wainwright, who happens to be the Police Commissioner of New York, who he has to regularly hypnotize in order to keep the police from interfering with him. Cranston's secret identity is endangered upon meeting [[Margo Lane]], a socialite who is also [[Telepathy|telepathic]].\n\nShiwan Khan, a powerful rogue prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the Tulku, arrives in New York inside [[Genghis Khan]]'s [[sarcophagus]]. As Khan's last descendant, Shiwan plans to fulfill his ancestor's ambitions of world domination. He proposes an alliance to Cranston, who refuses. After acquiring a rare coin from Khan, Cranston learns that it is made of bronzium, a metal that could be used for nuclear fission, and that Margo's father Reinhardt\u2014a scientist working on energy research for the [[United States Department of War|War Department]]\u2014has become uncharacteristically reclusive and aloof. Cranston deduces that Khan has compelled Reinhardt to create an [[atomic bomb]].\n\nKhan hypnotizes Margo and commands her to kill The Shadow. Cranston breaks Khan's hypnotic hold on her, but she learns his secret identity. Reinhardt's assistant Farley Claymore allies with Khan to produce a working bomb, which Khan uses to hold New York at ransom. The Shadow eventually discovers Khan's location: the luxurious Hotel Monolith, a building that Khan has rendered forgotten and invisible to the city's inhabitants. Entering the hotel for a showdown with Khan, The Shadow is subdued by the Phurba before he turns it against Khan, disrupting Khan's hypnotic control over Reinhardt and the city. While Margo and Reinhardt disarm the bomb, The Shadow pursues Khan through the hotel and defeats him by hurling a broken shard of glass into his [[frontal lobe]].\n\nKhan awakens in the padded cell of a mental hospital. One of the doctors tells Khan that they were able to save his life by removing a part of his brain, nullifying Khan's psychic abilities. Cranston and Margo begin a relationship and join forces to fight the criminal underworld.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as [[The Shadow|Lamont Cranston / The Shadow]],<ref>{{cite news|title= What Humor Lurks In 'The Shadow'?

And I decided that perhaps it was because he was uncomfortably familiar with the evil in his own heart.'<ref name=\"Schwager\"/> For Koepp, the film then became 'a story of guilt and atonement'.<ref name=\"Schwager\"/> He picked Shiwan Khan as the film\u2019s villain because 'he was bold and he knew what he was doing \u2013 he wanted to conquer the world. That was very simple, maybe a little ambitious, but he knew exactly what he wanted.'<ref name=\"Peterson, Don\"/> He had always been a fan of Alec Baldwin and wrote the script with him in mind: 'He has the eyes and the voice; he had so much of what I pictured Cranston being.'<ref name=\"Schwager\"/> Koepp also sat in on rehearsals and incorporated a lot of the actor\u2019s humor into the script.<ref name=\"Schwager\"/>\n\n[[Stephen H.

Among the [[leitmotif]]s of his score are a romantically dark, yet lush heroic melodic main [[Theme (music)|theme]] for the protagonist, which is accompanied by several secondary themes. For the antagonist, rather than a fully developed theme, Goldsmith used a musical effect in horns and synthesizers imitating a howling sound, a technique that would later echo in his scores for ''[[The Ghost and the Darkness]]'' (1996) and ''[[The Edge (1997 film)|The Edge]]'' (1997).\n\nFor the album and end credits, [[Jim Steinman]] composed the pop-song \"Original Sin\", performed by [[Taylor Dayne]]. This had originally appeared on  [[Original Sin (Pandora's Box album)|the album of the same name]], recorded by the female group [[Pandora's Box (band)|Pandora's Box]]. [[Diane Warren]] also composed a period-style big-band piece, \"Some Kind of Mystery\", performed by Sinoa during the film's first nightclub scene.\n\nThe [[Arista Records]] label released the soundtrack album in 1994.
