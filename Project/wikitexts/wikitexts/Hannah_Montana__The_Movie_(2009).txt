The film achieved commercial success, grossing $155 million in worldwide box office revenue against a $30 million budget. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Cyrus' acting but noted that it failed to differentiate itself as a feature film.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nMiley Stewart and her best friend Lilly Truscott arrive at a concert and race backstage just in time for Miley to perform as her secret [[alter ego]]: superstar pop singer Hannah Montana. After filming a music video for her song \u201c[[The Best of Both Worlds (song)|The Best of Both Worlds]]\u201d, Miley \u2013 as Hannah \u2013 is confronted by Oswald Granger, an unscrupulous tabloid reporter. Hannah\u2019s manager Vita sends Oswald away, but he manages to record her alluding to Hannah\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d, which he becomes determined to uncover.\n\nWhile shopping as Hannah, Miley fights with [[Tyra Banks]] over a pair of shoes, making her late for Lilly\u2019s birthday party. Oswald records the incident and follows her to the party, forcing Miley to attend as Hannah in order to prevent him from learning her secret. Her arrival as Hannah steals the entire party\u2019s attention, as does her performance of \u201c[[Let's Get Crazy (Hannah Montana song)|Let\u2019s Get Crazy]]\u201d. Hurt, Lilly leaves and is questioned by Oswald. She tells him that Hannah is from Crowley Corners, [[Tennessee]].\n\nAlready upset with Miley for prioritizing her celebrity life as Hannah over her family and friends, her father Robby is infuriated when her fight with Tyra makes headlines. He allows Vita to book a private jet for Miley to attend an awards show as Hannah, but instead flies her to Crowley Corners to spend two weeks there for her grandmother Ruby\u2019s birthday. Miley is eager to return to life as Hannah, but Ruby chastises her for seeming to prefer being Hannah over spending time with her family.\n\nMiley gradually reconnects with small-town life, her grandmother, and her childhood friend Travis Brody, while Robby is drawn to a local woman named Lorelai. Oswald arrives, and Miley is forced to misdirect him by claiming to know Hannah. The town holds a fundraiser to prevent developer Mr. Bradley from turning local land into a shopping mall, organizing a barn party where Miley performs \u201c[[Hoedown Throwdown]]\u201d as herself. When Mr. Bradley tells the crowd they will never raise enough money, Travis suggests Miley ask Hannah to hold a concert.\n\nLilly arrives disguised as Hannah to throw off Oswald and reconciles with Miley. Travis asks Miley out on a date, but she has already been invited by Lorelai to a dinner as Hannah with the town\u2019s mayor. Miley tries to run back and forth between both dinners, but Travis catches her mid-change and deduces her secret before angrily leaving. Miley then overhears Robby rejecting Lorelai to protect Miley's double-life. Miley finishes writing \u201c[[Butterfly Fly Away]]\u201d, which she and her father sing together. She stays up all night to complete the chicken coop she and Travis were building; touched by this, he rides to the concert.\n\nAs the town prepares for the concert, Miley receives her late mother\u2019s necklace from Ruby. The concert begins, but Miley stops mid-song when she sees Travis and Lorelai in the audience. Explaining that she can no longer live a lie, Miley removes her blonde wig, revealing her true identity to the crowd. She sings \u201c[[The Climb (song)|The Climb]]\", and the crowd pleads with her to continue being Hannah, promising to keep her secret. Oswald takes a picture of Miley, and is confronted by her friends and family. Before he can send it, his daughters arrive \u2013 flown to the concert by Vita \u2013 and their enthusiasm for Hannah convinces him not to sell the story; instead, he rebukes his editor Lucinda and quits. Miley reconciles with and kisses Travis and returns to the stage to finish the concert with \"[[You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home]]\", as Lorelai and Robby reunite. During the credits, the cast dances to \u201cHoedown Throwdown\u201d.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- The following is a cast list as credited in the movie.

Like the Hannah Montana's theme song says, \"You get the best of both worlds.\" Ten minutes before the movie started, the two rows of what looked to be 14-year-old girls started singing the TV show theme song. Over and over again. The little 6-to-10-year-old girls that filled the rest of the theater were singing along and dancing in their seats. My 16-year-old daughter said with a big smile on her face, 'Isn't this fun?' I said, with as much of a smile as I could muster, 'A little bit.'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicpopcorn.net/hannah-montanathe-movie-review|title=Hannah Montana: The Movie Review|author=Southernfury|work=Atomic Popcorn|date=April 10, 2009|access-date=October 23, 2009}}</ref> ''[[Blogcritics]]'' noted: \"This movie definitely hit the target audience mark with the best opening day for a live action, G-rated movie.
