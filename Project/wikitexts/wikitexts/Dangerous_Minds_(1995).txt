Smith]] and produced by [[Don Simpson]] and [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]. It is based on the autobiography ''My Posse Don't Do Homework'' by retired [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] [[LouAnne Johnson]], who in 1989 took up a teaching position at [[Carlmont High School]] in [[Belmont, California]], where most of her students were [[African Americans|African-American]] and [[Latino (demonym)|Latino]] teenagers from [[East Palo Alto]], a racially segregated and economically deprived city. [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] stars as Johnson.  The critical consensus on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] calls it \"rife with stereotypes\".<ref name=rt/> The film grossed $179.5 million and led to the creation of a short-lived [[Dangerous Minds (TV series)|television series]] and received mixed to negative reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nLouanne Johnson, a former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]], applies for a teaching job in high school, and is surprised and pleased to be offered the position with immediate effect. Showing up the next day to begin teaching, however, she finds herself confronted with a classroom of tough, sullen teenagers, all from low-income working-class backgrounds, involved in gang warfare and drug pushing, flatly refusing to engage with anything.\n\nThey immediately coin the nickname \"White Bread\" for Louanne, due to her race and apparent lack of authority, to which Louanne responds by returning the next day in a leather jacket and teaching them karate. The students show some interest in such activities, but withdraw when Louanne tries to teach the curriculum.\n\nDesperate to reach the students, Louanne devises classroom exercises that teach similar principles to the prescribed work but using themes and language that appeal to the students. She also tries to motivate them by giving them all an A grade from the beginning of the year, and arguing that the only thing required of them is that they maintain it.\n\nIn order to introduce them to poetry, Louanne uses the lyrics of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]\" to teach symbolism and metaphor; once this is achieved, she progresses on to [[Dylan Thomas]]'s \"[[Do not go gentle into that good night]]\". Louanne rewards the students liberally, using candy bars, reward incentives, and a trip to a theme park. Her methods draw the attention of the school authorities, George Grandey and Carla Nichols, who try to force her to remain within the curriculum.\n\nA few particular students attract Louanne's interest for their personal problems. Raul Sanchero is a boy who is frequently involved in gang warfare and street crime. Louanne tries to encourage him to focus by paying a special visit to his family to congratulate him on his work, and going to dinner with him as a way of instilling confidence and self-respect.\n\nEmilio Ramirez is her most troublesome personal \"project\", as he believes strongly in a sense of personal honor that prevents him from asking for help. When Louanne discovers that his life is in danger because of a personal grudge held by a recently released thug, she advises him to seek help from Principal Grandey. The next day, Emilio visits Grandey, but Grandey (not realizing that Emilio is in serious danger) instantly dismisses him because he neglected to knock on the door before entering his office.\n\nFeeling rejected, Emilio leaves the school and is subsequently killed by his rival. Heartbroken by her failure to protect Emilio and angry at the indifferent school system for contributing to his death, Louanne announces to the class her intention to leave the school at the end of the academic year. The students immediately break down, begging her not to leave. Overwhelmed by their unbridled display of emotion, she decides to stay.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as [[LouAnne Johnson]]\n* [[George Dzundza]] as Hal Griffith\n* [[Courtney B.
