The [[Rashomon effect]] is named after the film.\n\n==Plot==\n\n=== Prologue ===\nThe plot begins in [[Heian period|Heian era]] [[Heian-ky\u014d|Kyoto]]. A woodcutter and a priest are sitting beneath the [[Raj\u014dmon|Rash\u014dmon city gate]] to stay dry in a downpour when a commoner joins them and they begin recounting a very disturbing story about an assault and murder that took place. Neither the woodcutter nor the priest understand how everyone involved could have given radically different accounts of the same event, with all three of the people involved indicating that they, and they alone, committed the murder.\n\nThe woodcutter claims he found the body of a murdered samurai while looking for wood in the forest, three days earlier. He first found a woman's hat (which belonged to the samurai's wife), then a samurai cap (which belonged to her husband), then cut rope (which had been used to bind the husband), then an amulet. Finally, he discovered the body, upon which he fled to notify the authorities. The priest claims he saw the samurai traveling with his wife the same day the murder happened. Both men were summoned to testify in court, where a fellow witness presented a captured bandit, who claimed to have followed the couple after coveting the woman when he glimpsed her in the forest.\n\n===The bandit's story===\nTaj\u014dmaru, the bandit and a notorious outlaw, claims that he tricked the samurai to step off the mountain trail with him to look at a cache of ancient swords he had discovered. In the grove, he tied the samurai to a tree, then brought the samurai's wife there with the intention of assaulting her. She initially tried to defend herself with a dagger but was overpowered and then seduced by the bandit. The wife, ashamed, begged Taj\u014dmaru to duel her husband to the death, to save her from the guilt and shame of having two men know her dishonor. Taj\u014dmaru honorably set the samurai free and dueled with him. They fought skillfully and fiercely, with Taj\u014dmaru praising the samurai's swordsmanship. In the end, Taj\u014dmaru killed the samurai, causing the wife to flee in terror. At the end of his testimony, he is asked about the expensive dagger used by the samurai's wife. Taj\u014dmaru claims he forgot about it in the confusion after the fight, and laments leaving it behind, as the dagger's pearl inlay made it very valuable.\n\n===The wife's story===\nThe wife's testimony tells a different story. She claims that Taj\u014dmaru left immediately after assaulting her. Once he was gone, she begged her husband for forgiveness, but he simply stared at her coldly. She freed him and begged him to kill her so that she would be at peace, but he continued to stare at her with loathing. His contempt distressed her so greatly, she fainted while standing over her husband, with the dagger in her hands. She awoke to find her husband dead, the dagger in his chest. In shock, she wandered through the forest until she came upon a pond. She attempted to drown herself, but failed.\n\n===The samurai's story===\nLastly, the court hears the story from the perspective of the samurai, as told through a [[Mediumship|medium]]. The samurai claims that after the assault, Taj\u014dmaru asked the wife to travel with him. She accepted, but asked Taj\u014dmaru to first kill her husband so that she would not feel the guilt of belonging to two men. Shocked, Taj\u014dmaru grabbed her and gave the samurai the choice: let her go or kill her. The wife broke free and fled, with Taj\u014dmaru giving chase. Taj\u014dmaru failed to recapture her, gave up, and returned to set the samurai free. Taj\u014dmaru apologized, and then departed. Humiliated, the samurai [[seppuku|killed himself]] with his wife's dagger. Later, he felt someone remove the dagger from his chest, but could not tell who.\n\n===The woodcutter's story===\nBack at Rash\u014dmon (after the trial), the woodcutter claims that all three stories are falsehoods. The woodcutter says he witnessed the assault and murder, but declined the opportunity to testify because he did not want to get involved. According to the woodcutter, after the assault, Taj\u014dmaru begged the samurai's wife to marry him. Instead, she freed her husband, hoping that he would kill Taj\u014dmaru. However, the samurai refused to fight, explaining to Taj\u014dmaru that he would not risk his life for a spoiled woman. The wife criticizes both men, calling them cowards: Taj\u014dmaru because he would not kill the samurai to have her, the samurai because he would not kill Taj\u014dmaru to avenge his own honor. She urges them to fight, claiming that real men fight for a woman's love. The two men fight, but it is a clumsy, terrified, and pitiful duel, nothing like what Taj\u014dmaru describes in his testimony. Ultimately, Taj\u014dmaru won through a stroke of luck. The wife fled after the duel, and Taj\u014dmaru could not catch her due to a minor injury. He took the samurai's sword, and limped away.\n\n===Epilogue===\nAt Rash\u014dmon gate, the woodcutter, the priest, and the commoner are interrupted by the sound of a crying baby. They find a baby abandoned in a basket, with a kimono and an amulet. The commoner steals the kimono and amulet. The woodcutter reproaches the commoner for stealing from an orphaned child and attempts to stop him. The commoner overpowers the woodcutter, and chastises him as a hypocrite: the commoner correctly deduces that the true reason the woodcutter declined to testify is because he's the one who stole the valuable dagger. The commoner leaves Rash\u014dmon gate, explaining that all men are motivated only by [[psychological egoism|self-interest]].\n\nMeanwhile, the priest has been attempting to soothe the baby. After the commoner departs, the woodcutter attempts to take the baby. The priest violently recoils: his experiences at the trial and at Rash\u014dmon gate have destroyed the priest's faith in humanity. The woodcutter explains that he intends to raise the child; he already has six of his own. This revelation recasts the woodcutter's story and motivations, restoring the priest's faith in humanity. As the woodcutter prepares to leave with the child, the rain stops and the clouds part, revealing the sun.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Takashi Shimura]] as Kikori, the woodcutter\n* [[Minoru Chiaki]] as Tabi H\u014dshi, the priest\n* Kichijiro Ueda as the commoner\n* [[Toshiro Mifune]] as Taj\u014dmaru, the bandit\n* [[Machiko Ky\u014d]] as the Samurai's wife\n* [[Masayuki Mori (actor)|Masayuki Mori]] as the Samurai\n* [[Noriko Honma]] as [[Miko]], the medium\n* [[Daisuke Kat\u014d]] as Houben, the policeman\n\n==Production==\nThe name of the film refers to the enormous, former [[Raj\u014dmon|city gate \"between modern-day Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]\", on Suzaka Avenue's end to the south.<ref>Richie, ''Rashomon'', p 113.</ref>\n\n===Development===\nKurosawa felt that sound cinema multiplies the complexity of a film: <blockquote>Cinematic sound is never merely accompaniment, never merely what the sound machine caught while you took the scene. Real sound does not merely add to the images, it multiplies it.</blockquote> Regarding ''Rashomon'', Kurosawa said, <blockquote>I like silent pictures and I always have... I wanted to restore some of this beauty. I thought of it, I remember in this way: one of the techniques of modern art is simplification, and that I must therefore simplify this film.\"<ref>[[Donald Richie]], ''The Films of Akira Kurosawa''.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccordingly, there are only three settings in the film: [[Raj\u014dmon|Rash\u014dmon]] gate, the woods, and the [[courtyard]]. The gate and the courtyard are very simply constructed and the [[woodland]] is real. This is partly due to the low budget that Kurosawa gained from Daiei.\n\n===Casting===\nWhen Kurosawa shot ''Rashomon'', the actors and the staff lived together, a system Kurosawa found beneficial. He recalls, <blockquote>We were a very small group and it was as though I was directing ''Rashomon'' every minute of the day and night. At times like this, you can talk everything over and get very close indeed.<ref>Qtd. in Richie, ''Films''.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Filming===\nThe [[cinematographer]], [[Kazuo Miyagawa]], contributed numerous ideas, technical skill, and expertise in support for what would be an experimental and influential approach to cinematography. For example, in one sequence, there is a series of single close-ups of the bandit, then the wife, and then the husband, which then repeats to emphasize the triangular relationship between them.<ref>''The World of Kazuo Miyagawa'' (original title: ''The Camera Also Acts: Movie Cameraman Miyagawa Kazuo'') director unknown. NHK, year unknown. Television/Criterion blu-ray</ref>\n\nThe use of contrasting shots is another example of the film techniques used in ''Rashomon''. According to [[Donald Richie]], the length of time of the shots of the wife and of the bandit are the same when the bandit is acting barbarically and the wife is hysterically crazy.<ref>Richie, ''Films''.</ref>\n\n''Rashomon'' had camera shots that were directly into the sun. Kurosawa wanted to use natural light, but it was too weak; they solved the problem by using a mirror to reflect the natural light. The result makes the strong sunlight look as though it has traveled through the branches, hitting the actors. The rain in the scenes at the gate had to be tinted with black ink because camera lenses could not capture the water pumped through the hoses.<ref name=kurosawa>{{cite web|title=Akira Kurosawa on Rashomon|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/196-akira-kurosawa-on-rashomon|access-date=May 2, 2022|author=Akira Kurosawa |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128061133/http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/196-akira-kurosawa-on-rashomon |archive-date=November 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |quote=when the camera was aimed upward at the cloudy sky over the gate, the sprinkle of the rain couldn\u2019t be seen against it, so we made rainfall with black ink in it. }}</ref>\n\n===Lighting===\n[[Robert Altman]] compliments Kurosawa's use of \"dappled\" light throughout the film, which gives the characters and settings further ambiguity.<ref>Altman, Robert. One typical example from the movie which shows the ambiguity of the characters is when the bandit and the wife talk to each other in the woods, the light falls on the person who is not talking and shows the amused expressions, this represents the ambiguity present. \"Altman Introduction to Rashomon,\" Criterion Collection DVD, Rashomon.</ref> In his essay \"Rashomon,\" [[Tadao Sato]] suggests that the film (unusually) uses sunlight to symbolize evil and sin in the film, arguing that the wife gives in to the bandit's desires when she sees the sun. However, Professor Keiko I. McDonald opposes Sato's idea in her essay \"The Dialectic of Light and Darkness in Kurosawa's ''Rashomon''.\" McDonald says the film conventionally uses light to symbolize \"good\" or \"reason\" and darkness to symbolize \"bad\" or \"impulse.\" She interprets the scene mentioned by Sato differently, pointing out that the wife gives herself to the bandit when the sun slowly fades out. McDonald also reveals that Kurosawa was waiting for a big cloud to appear over Rashomon gate to shoot the final scene in which the woodcutter takes the abandoned baby home; Kurosawa wanted to show that there might be another dark rain any time soon, even though the sky is clear at this moment. Unfortunately, the final scene appears optimistic because it was too sunny and clear to produce the effects of an overcast sky.\n\n===Editing===\n[[Stanley Kauffmann]] writes in ''The Impact of Rashomon'' that Kurosawa often shot a scene with several cameras at the same time, so that he could \"cut the film freely and splice together the pieces which have caught the action forcefully as if flying from one piece to another.\" Despite this, he also used short shots edited together that trick the audience into seeing one shot; [[Donald Richie]] says in his essay that \"there are 407 separate shots in the body of the film ... This is more than twice the number in the usual film, and yet these shots never call attention to themselves.\"\n\n===Music===\nThe film was scored by [[Fumio Hayasaka]], who is among the most respected of Japanese composers.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3406802357.html |title=Hayasaka, Fumio&nbsp;\u2013 Dictionary definition of Hayasaka, Fumio &#124; Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com |access-date=2011-10-21}}</ref> At the director's request, he included a [[Bolero (Spanish dance)|bolero]] during the woman's story.<ref name=kurosawa />\n\nDue to setbacks and some lost audio, the crew took the urgent step of bringing Mifune back to the studio after filming to record another line. Recording engineer [[Iwao \u014ctani]] added it to the film along with the music, using a different microphone.<ref>Teruyo Nogami, ''Waiting on the Weather: Making Movies with Akira Kurosawa'', Stone Bridge Press, Inc., 1 September 2006, p. 90, {{ISBN|1933330090}}.</ref>\n\n==Allegorical and symbolic content==\n{{See also|Rashomon effect}}\n\nThe film depicts the rape of a woman and the murder of her [[samurai]] husband through the widely differing accounts of four [[witness]]es, including the bandit-rapist, the wife, the dead man (speaking through a medium), and lastly the woodcutter, the one witness who seems the most objective and least biased. The stories are [[Unreliable narrator|mutually contradictory]] and even the final version may be seen as motivated by factors of ego and saving face. The actors kept approaching Kurosawa wanting to know the truth, and he claimed the point of the film was to be an exploration of multiple realities rather than an exposition of a particular truth. Later film and television use of the \"[[Rashomon effect]]\" focuses on revealing \"the truth\" in a now conventional technique that presents the final version of a story as the truth, an approach that only matches Kurosawa's film on the surface.\n\nDue to its emphasis on the subjectivity of truth and the uncertainty of factual accuracy, ''Rashomon'' has been read by some as an allegory of the defeat of Japan at the end of World War II. James F. Davidson's article, \"Memory of Defeat in Japan: A Reappraisal of ''Rashomon''\" in the December 1954 issue of the ''Antioch Review'', is an early analysis of the World War II defeat elements.<ref>The article has since appeared in some subsequent ''Rashomon'' anthologies, including ''Focus on Rashomon'' [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0137529724] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221101033706/https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0137529724 |date=November 1, 2022 }} in 1972 and ''Rashomon (Rutgers Film in Print)'' [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0813511798] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221101033711/https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0813511798 |date=November 1, 2022 }} in 1987.

It also briefly mentions James Goodwin's view on the influence of post-war events on the film. However, \"[[In a Grove]]\" (the short story by Akutagawa that the film is based on) was published already in 1922, so any postwar allegory would have been the result of Kurosawa's editing rather than the story about the conflicting accounts. Historian and critic David Conrad has noted that the use of rape as a plot point came at a time when American [[occupation of Japan|occupation]] authorities had recently stopped censoring Japanese media and belated accounts of rapes by occupation troops began to appear in Japanese newspapers. Moreover, Kurosawa and other filmmakers had not been allowed to make ''[[jidaigeki]]'' during the early part of the occupation, so setting a film in the distant past was a way to reassert domestic control over cinema.<ref>{{cite book| last=Conrad|first=David A.|title=Akira Kurosawa and Modern Japan|year=2022|pages=81\u201384|publisher=McFarland & Co.|isbn=978-1-4766-8674-5}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Rashomon poster.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Original release poster for ''Rashomon'']]\n\n===Theatrical===\n''Rashomon'' was released in Japan on August 24, 1950.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1994|p=309}} It was released theatrically in the United States by [[RKO Radio Pictures]] with English subtitles on December 26, 1951.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1994|p=309}}\n\n===Home media===\n''Rashomon'' has been released multiple times on DVD.

However, [[Kadokawa Pictures|Daiei Motion Picture Company]] (a producer of popular features at the time) and the Japanese government had disagreed with the choice of Kurosawa's work on the grounds that it was \"not [representative enough] of the Japanese movie industry\" and felt that a work of [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]] would have been more illustrative of excellence in Japanese cinema. Despite these reservations, the film was screened at the festival.\n\nBefore it was screened at the Venice festival, the film initially drew little attention and had low expectations at the festival, as [[Japanese cinema]] was not yet taken seriously in the West at the time. But once it had been screened, ''Rashomon'' drew an overwhelmingly positive response from festival audiences, praising the originality of the film and its techniques while making many question the nature of [[truth]].<ref name=\"Emporia\">{{cite news |title=A Religion of Film |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/12877901/ |access-date=19 April 2022 |work=[[The Emporia Gazette]] |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |date=20 September 1963 |page=4 |url-access=subscription |quote=The historians of the new cinema, searching out its origins, go back to another festival, the one at Venice in 1951. That year the least promising item on the cinemenu was a Japanese picture called Rashomon. Japanese pictures, as all film experts knew, were just a bunch of chrysanthemums. So the judges sat down yawning. They got up dazed. Rashomon was a cinematic thunderbolt that violently ripped open the dark heart of man to prove that the truth was not in it. In technique the picture was traumatically original; in spirit it was big, strong, male. It was obviously the work of a genius, and that genius was Akira Kurosawa, the easliest herald of the new era in cinema.}}</ref> The film won both the Italian Critics Award and the [[Golden Lion]] award\u2014introducing Western audiences, including Western directors, more noticeably to both Kurosawa's films and techniques, such as shooting directly into the sun and using mirrors to reflect sunlight onto the actor's faces.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on December 26, 1951, by [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] in both subtitled and dubbed versions, and it won an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1952 for being \"the most outstanding foreign language film released in the United States during 1951\" (the current [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] wasn't introduced until 1956). The following year, when it was eligible for consideration in other Academy Award categories, it was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction for a Black-and-White Film]].\n\nUpon release in North America, [[Ed Sullivan]] gave the film a positive review in ''[[Hollywood Citizen-News]]'', calling it \"an exciting evening, because the direction, the photography and the performances will jar open your eyes.\" He praised Akutagawa's original plot, Kurosawa's impactful direction and screenplay, Mifune's \"magnificent\" villainous performance, and Miyagawa's \"spellbinding\" cinematography that achieves \"visual dimensions that I've never seen in Hollywood photography\" such as being \"shot through a relentless rainstorm that heightens the mood of the somber drama.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sullivan |first1=Ed |author1-link=Ed Sullivan |title=Behind the Scenes |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/683939225/ |access-date=19 April 2022 |work=[[Hollywood Citizen-News]] |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |date=22 January 1952 |page=12 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> In the early 1960s, film historians credited ''Rashomon'' as the start of the international [[New Wave cinema]] movement, which gained popularity during the late 1950s to early 1960s.<ref name=\"Emporia\"/>\n\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 98% of 52 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; with an average rating of 9.3/10.
