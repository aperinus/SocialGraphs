[[Peter Hyams]] and [[Rob Cohen]] served as executive producers. It was released by [[TriStar Pictures]] on August 14, 1987. The film features [[pastiche]]s of the [[Universal Classic Monsters|Universal Monsters]], led by [[Count Dracula]]. They are confronted by a group of savvy kids out to keep them from controlling the world.\n\nWhile being financially unsuccessful during its theatrical run and receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film has gained a positive reception from audiences and has become a [[cult following|cult classic]] in the years since its release.\n\n==Plot==\nThe Monster Squad is a club of [[Preadolescence|pre-teens]] who idolize [[Universal Classic Monsters|classic monster movies]] and their non-human stars. Club leader Sean Crenshaw ([[Andre Gower]]), whose younger sister, Phoebe (Ashley Bank), desperately wants to join the club, is given the diary of legendary monster hunter [[Abraham Van Helsing|Dr. Abraham Van Helsing]] ([[Jack Gwillim]]), but his excitement abates when he finds it is written in German. Sean and the rest of the Monster Squad{{snd}}his best friend and second in command Patrick Rhodes (Robby Kiger), clumsy overweight Horace (Brent Chalem), tough older kid Rudy Holloran (Ryan Lambert) and little Eugene (Michael Faustino), {{snd}}go to visit an elderly man, known as the \"Scary German Guy\" ([[Leonardo Cimino]]), actually a kind gentleman and a former [[Concentration camp|concentration camp prisoner]], to translate the diary.\n\nThe diary describes, in great detail, an amulet that is composed of concentrated good. One day out of every century, as the forces of good and evil reach a balance, the otherwise indestructible amulet becomes vulnerable to destruction. With the next day of balance happening within a few days, at the stroke of midnight, the kids realize they must gain possession of the amulet and use it{{snd}}with an incantation from Van Helsing's diary{{snd}}to open a wormhole in the universe and cast the monsters into [[Limbo]]. As shown in the film's prelude, Van Helsing had unsuccessfully attempted this one hundred years ago in order to defeat his old adversary [[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Count Dracula]] ([[Duncan Regehr]]); his apprentices then emigrated to the United States to hide the amulet, where it was out of Dracula's immediate reach.\n\nNevertheless, Dracula seeks to obtain the amulet so that he can take over the world and plunge it into darkness. To this end, he assembles several of his most dangerous and monstrous allies: [[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]] (Michael MacKay), the [[Gill-man]] ([[Tom Woodruff Jr.]]), [[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]] (Carl Thibault), and in addition, three school girls (Mary Albee, Joan-Carrol Baron, and Julie Merrill) whom the Count transforms into his [[Brides of Dracula|vampiric consorts]]. Dracula then steals a crate from a [[B-25 Mitchell]] in flight, containing [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein's monster]] ([[Tom Noonan]]), thus completing his army. However, Frankenstein's monster is reluctant to aid Dracula, and wanders into the forest where he encounters Phoebe. Rather than being afraid, she shows him the kindness he has always sought, and they become friends. After Phoebe proves to the Monster Squad that Frankenstein's monster is not evil, he chooses to help the boys instead of Dracula. The Wolfman, when reverting to human form ([[Jonathan Gries]]), is a recalcitrant follower of Dracula, and has been making calls to the police about the forthcoming carnage, which are dismissed as prank calls.\n\nThe amulet is buried in a stone room beneath a house that Dracula and the other monsters now occupy and where Van Helsing's diary was found. The secret room is littered with wards which prevent the monsters from taking it. The Monster Squad break into the house and acquire the amulet and narrowly escape Dracula's grasp. They confer with The Scary German Guy who informs them that the incantation must be read by a female virgin. As midnight approaches, the Squad makes their way to a local cathedral to make their last stand. Meanwhile, Dracula destroys their clubhouse with dynamite, drawing the attention of Sean's father, Police Detective Del ([[Stephen Macht]]), who has been charged with investigating the strange occurrences in town (as caused by Dracula's cohorts), but remains quite skeptical about their supernatural causes until he sees Dracula in person.\n\nUnfortunately, the doors to the cathedral are locked, so the incantation must be read on the stoop, leaving the Squad vulnerable. They enlist Patrick's beautiful elder sister Lisa ([[Lisa Fuller]]) to help them, as she is the only virgin they know. However, the incantation fails since Lisa is actually not a virgin anymore. As the monsters close in, the Squad deduces that Phoebe must complete the task of opening the portal, and the German Guy attempts to help her read the incantation as the rest of the Squad fends off the monsters.\n\nIn the ensuing battle, Dracula's consorts, the Mummy, the Gill-man, and the Wolfman are defeated. Dracula arrives to destroy the amulet when Frankenstein's monster intervenes, impaling him on a wrought-iron cross. Phoebe finishes the incantation, opening the portal which begins to consume the bodies of the monsters. Dracula, still alive, attempts to drag Sean in with him. Sean impales Dracula with a wooden stake as Patrick grabs Sean before he can be sucked into the portal. Having briefly escaped from Limbo, Van Helsing appears, gives a thumbs up to Sean on a job well done, and pulls Dracula to his doom. As Frankenstein's monster is drawn into the portal, Phoebe holds onto him and pleads for him to stay. Knowing he doesn't belong on Earth, Frankenstein's monster lets go of Phoebe's hand, but accepts her gift of a stuffed animal to remember her by. The portal then closes, ensuring the world's safety.\n\nIn the aftermath, the United States Army arrives on the scene, having received a letter from Eugene earlier on asking for their help against the monsters. When the confused general fails to make sense of the situation, Sean steps forward and presents the man with his business card, identifying himself and his friends as \"The Monster Squad\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Andre Gower]] as Sean Crenshaw\n* Robby Kiger as Patrick Rhodes\n* [[Stephen Macht]] as Detective Del Crenshaw\n* [[Duncan Regehr]] as [[Count Dracula]]\n* [[Tom Noonan]] as [[Frankenstein's monster]]\n* Brent Chalem as Horace \n* Ryan Lambert as Rudy Holloran\n* Ashley Bank as Phoebe Crenshaw\n* Michael Faustino as Eugene\n* [[Jonathan Gries]] as [[Larry Talbot|Desperate Man]] / [[Werewolf|The Wolf Man]]\n* [[Mary Ellen Trainor]] as Emily Crenshaw\n* [[Leonardo Cimino]] as Scary German Guy\n* [[Stan Shaw]] as Detective Rich Sapir\n* [[Lisa Fuller]] as Lisa Rhodes\n* Carl Thibault as [[Werewolf|The Wolf Man]]\n* [[Tom Woodruff Jr.]] as [[Gill-man]]\n* Michael Reid MacKay as [[Mummy (undead)|Mummy]]\n* [[Jack Gwillim]] as [[Abraham Van Helsing]]\n* Adam Carl as Derek\n* [[Jason Hervey]] as E.J.\n* [[David Proval]] as Pilot\n* [[Daryl Anderson]] as Co-Pilot\n* Mary Albee as [[Brides of Dracula|Vampire Bride #1]]\n* Brynn Baron as [[Brides of Dracula|Vampire Bride #2]]\n* Julie Merrill as [[Brides of Dracula|Vampire Bride #3]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=July 2015}}\nThough the film was a financial failure on its initial release, it subsequently developed a [[cult film|cult following]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.metroactive.com/metro/05.24.06/cult-0621.html|title=Cult Leader {{!}} The Monster Squad|last=Palopoli|first=Steve|work=[[Metro Silicon Valley|Metroactive]]|date=2006-05-24|access-date=2014-11-07}}</ref>  [[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 62% of 26 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 5.88/10 With the site's consensus stating, \"A fun 80's adventure with a slightly scary twist, ''The Monster Squad'' offers tween-friendly horror with just enough of a kick\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rottentomatoes.com/m/monster_squad/|title=The Monster Squad (1987)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=2014-11-07}}</ref>  Kevin Thomas of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that it is \"fun for the kid in all of us\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-14/entertainment/ca-755_1_monster-squad|title=Movie Review : 'Monster Squad' Is Fun For The Kid In All Of Us|last=Thomas|first=Kevin|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1987-08-14|access-date=2014-11-07}}</ref>  [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it \"a feature-length commercial for a joke store that sells not-great, rubber monster masks\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DE2DF1E3FF937A2575BC0A961948260&pagewanted=all|title=The Monster Squad (1987)|last=Canby|first=Vincent|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1987-08-14|access-date=2014-11-07}}</ref>\n\n==Home video==\n''The Monster Squad'' was first issued by [[Vestron Video]] in 1988 on [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]].
