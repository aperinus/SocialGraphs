Based on the books ''[[The Snowden Files]]'' (2014) by [[Luke Harding (journalist)|Luke Harding]] and ''Time of the Octopus'' (2015) by [[Anatoly Kucherena]], the film stars [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as [[Edward Snowden]], a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) subcontractor and [[whistleblower]] who copied and [[News leak|leaked]] [[Classified information in the United States|highly classified information]] from the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) beginning [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013\u2013present)|in 2013]]. In addition to Gordon-Levitt, the film features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Shailene Woodley]], [[Melissa Leo]], [[Zachary Quinto]], [[Tom Wilkinson]], [[Scott Eastwood]], [[Logan Marshall-Green]], [[Timothy Olyphant]], [[Ben Schnetzer]], [[Keith Stanfield|LaKeith Lee Stanfield]], [[Rhys Ifans]] and [[Nicolas Cage]]. An international co-production of Germany, France, and the United States, [[principal photography]] began on February 16, 2015 in [[Munich]].\n\n''Snowden'' screened at [[San Diego Comic-Con]] on July 21, 2016, before premiering at the [[2016 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 9, 2016. The film was theatrically released in the United States on September 16, 2016, by [[Open Road Films]] and on September 22 in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/07/emma-roberts-dave-franco-nerve-star-trek-beyond-sausage-party-comic-con-1201788479/ |title=Emma Roberts-Dave Franco Thriller 'Nerve' To Sneak At Comic-Con |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=July 19, 2016|access-date=July 18, 2016}}</ref> It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Gordon-Levitt's performance but criticized the direction. It was also a [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]], grossing $37.3 million worldwide against its $40 million budget.<ref name=\"BOM\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2013, [[Edward Snowden]] arranges a clandestine meeting in [[Hong Kong]] with [[Documentary film|documentarian]] [[Laura Poitras]] and [[journalist]] [[Glenn Greenwald]]. They discuss releasing the classified information in the former\u2019s possession regarding illegal [[mass surveillance]] conducted by the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). Poitras later released a documentary about this meeting titled ''[[Citizenfour]]'', this in turn was used in a scene within the film ''Snowden''.\n\nIn 2004, Snowden is undergoing basic training, having enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] with intentions of matriculating to the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]]. He eventually fractures his [[tibia]], and is informed that he will be receiving an administrative discharge and that he may serve his country in other ways.\n\nSnowden applies for a position at the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) and subsequently undergoes the screening process. {{anchor|Corbin O'Brian}}Initially, his answers to the screening questions are insufficient, but [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director]] Corbin O'Brian decides to take a chance on him, given the demands of such extraordinary times. Snowden is then brought to \"The Hill\" where he is educated and tested on [[cyberwarfare]]. He learns about the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]], which circumvents the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights of U.S. citizens by allowing warrant requests to be approved by a panel of judges that were appointed by the [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]]. Snowden and his peers are each tasked with building a covert communications network in their hometown, deleting it, and then rebuilding it in eight hours or less, with five hours being the average time taken. Snowden impresses O'Brian when he completes the exercise in 38 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, Snowden meets [[Lindsay Mills]] via a dating website. The two bond, despite sharply contrasting political ideologies. Snowden acquires his first post abroad working with diplomatic cover in [[Geneva]] in 2007, taking Mills with him. He meets Gabriel Sol, who has ample experience in electronic surveillance. Snowden begins questioning the ethical implications of their assignment. After his superior decides to set up their target on a [[Driving under the influence|DUI]] charge in order to coerce information from him, Snowden resigns from the CIA.\n\nSnowden later takes a position with the NSA in [[Japan]], initially under the pretense of building a program that would allow the government to back up all critical data from the [[Middle East]] in an emergency, a program which he names \"Epic Shelter\". Snowden learns of the practices the NSA and other U.S. government agencies are using not just in Japan, but in most countries which the U.S. is currently allied with, which include planting [[malware]] in different computers that manage government, infrastructure and financial sectors so that, in the event that any allies turn against the US, that country can effectively be shut down in retaliation. The stress associated with the job results in the end of his relationship with Mills, who moves back with her family in [[Maryland]].\n\nThree months later, Snowden has left his post with the NSA and returned to Maryland where he and Mills resume their relationship and he takes a position consulting for the CIA. During a hunting trip, O'Brian reveals an operation in [[Oahu]] that revolves around counterattacking [[China|Chinese]] hackers. After Snowden is diagnosed with [[epilepsy]], Mills agrees that he should join the operation for she believes the environment in [[Hawaii]] may be beneficial for his health. Upon beginning his new job in \"[[Hawaii Cryptologic Center|The Tunnel]]\", an underground [[World War II]] bunker that has been re-purposed for massive electronic surveillance and [[Signals Intelligence|SIGINT]] operations, Snowden learns that Epic Shelter is actually providing real-time data that assists U.S. [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|drone]] pilots in launching lethal strikes against terror suspects in [[Pakistan]].\n\nSnowden ultimately becomes disillusioned with what he is a part of. It culminates in Snowden smuggling a [[Secure Digital|microSD]] card into his office by way of a [[Rubik's Cube]], and loading all relevant data. He then tells his colleagues he is feeling ill and departs. He advises Mills to fly home to Maryland, after which he contacts Poitras and Greenwald to schedule the meeting.\n\nWith the help of journalist [[Ewen MacAskill]], the information is disseminated to the press on June 5, 2013, with additional leaks published in the following days. In the aftermath, with the help of MacAskill, Greenwald and Poitras, Snowden is smuggled out of Hong Kong on a flight bound for [[Latin America]] by way of [[Russia]]. However, the U.S. government revokes his [[US Passport|passport]], forcing him to remain in [[Moscow]] indefinitely. He is eventually granted [[right of asylum|asylum]] for three years, with Mills joining him at a later date. Snowden continues his [[activism]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as [[Edward Snowden]]\n** Edward Snowden briefly portrays himself in a cameo\n* [[Shailene Woodley]] as [[Lindsay Mills]]\n* [[Melissa Leo]] as [[Laura Poitras]]\n* [[Zachary Quinto]] as [[Glenn Greenwald]]\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as [[Ewen MacAskill]]\n* [[Scott Eastwood]] as Trevor James\n* [[Logan Marshall-Green]] as Male Drone Pilot/\"Catfish\"\n* [[Timothy Olyphant]] as [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer Geneva\n* [[Ben Schnetzer]] as Gabriel Sol\n* [[Keith Stanfield|LaKeith Lee Stanfield]] as Patrick Haynes\n* [[Rhys Ifans]] as Corbin O\u2019Brian\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Hank Forrester\n* [[Joely Richardson]] as [[Janine Gibson]]\n* Robert Firth as Dr. Stillwell\n* [[Ben Chaplin]] as Robert Tibbo\n{{div col end}}\n[[Anatoly Kucherena]], Snowden's Russian attorney and the author of the novel ''Time of the Octopus'', on which the screenplay is said to be partly based, plays a Russian diplomat in one of the Geneva scenes.\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Edward Snowden 2013-10-9 (1) (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Oliver Stone]] met [[Edward Snowden]] multiple times in [[Moscow]] and spent time researching what happened to him.]]\n\nWhen [[Oliver Stone]] was first approached to helm the film, he was hesitant.
