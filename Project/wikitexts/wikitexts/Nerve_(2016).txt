The film stars [[Emma Roberts]], [[Dave Franco]] and [[Juliette Lewis]], and revolves around an online [[truth or dare]] game, which allows people to enlist as \"players\" or \"watchers\" and  as the game progresses further, the players are contacted and invited to participate in more dangerous and risky dares than their prior ones.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[School of Visual Arts|SVA Theater]] on July 12, 2016<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Photos/Nerve-premieres-in-New-York-City/10392/|title='Nerve' premieres in New York City (NYC) - Photos|date=July 13, 2016|work=[[United Press International]]|access-date=July 16, 2016}}</ref> and was theatrically released on July 27, 2016, by [[Lionsgate]].

Her friend Sydney becomes popular in ''Nerve'': an online reality game where people either enlist as \"players\" or pay to watch as \"watchers\". Players accept dares voted on by watchers, try to become the winner of that day, and receive monetary rewards.\n\nSydney chastises Vee's unadventurous nature so Vee signs up as a player on ''Nerve''. She learns that all dares must be recorded on the player's phone, earned money will be revoked if a player fails or bails on a dare, and that \"snitches get stitches.\"\n\nVee's first dare is to kiss a stranger at a [[diner]]. At the diner she kisses Ian, who dances and sings to Vee, revealing he's another player on a dare. The watchers dare Ian to take her into [[Manhattan]] on his motorcycle.\n\nIn Manhattan they are dared to try on expensive [[formal attire]]. Their street clothes are stolen and the watchers dare them to leave the store, so they flee in their [[undergarments]]. They return to Ian's motorbike where they find the expensive clothes paid for by the watchers.\n\nVee is dared to get a [[tattoo]] chosen by Ian, and Ian is dared to ride his motorbike through the city blindfolded at 60&nbsp;mph, using Vee to steer his body; once completed, the two kiss. Vee and Ian become among ''Nerve\u2019''s top players.\n\nJealous of Vee's rise of popularity on ''Nerve'', Sydney accepts a dare at a party to cross a ladder between two buildings, but she bails and is eliminated from the game. Vee catches Sydney making out with J.P., a boy Vee likes. After Vee and Sydney argue, Vee\u2019s hacker friend, Tommy reveals that Ian was dared into making them argue. Vee breaks up her partnership with Ian, and then completes the ladder dare. Realising how dangerous ''Nerve'' is, Vee attempts to report the game to the police, but is disbelieved. As a result, Vee\u2019s identity is removed. Popular player, Ty knocks Vee out to keep her in the game.\n\nVee wakes up in a [[Intermodal container|shipping container]] with \"snitches get stitches\" on the walls. She escapes and finds Ian, who confesses that he and Ty were players whose friend was killed in a dare. When they tried to alert the authorities, their families' jobs, bank accounts, and identities were confiscated. Vee has now joined them in the secret third category of the game: \"prisoners\". If a prisoner can reach and win the day\u2019s final round, they regain everything.\n\nSydney decides to help Tommy's hacker friends disable ''Nerve'' by altering the game's online code, but it is impossible to simply shut down ''Nerve'', as all the watchers phones and profiles act as a [[Distributed computing|distributed server]].\n\nVee and Ian earn the two spots in the final dare, which takes place at [[Battery Weed]]. The winner will be whoever shoots the other with the handguns they\u2019ve been given. Ian offers her the win, but when she also refuses to shoot, Ty jumps from the audience and takes Ian's place. He tells the watchers to vote wherever or not he should shoot Vee. The watchers vote for Ty to shoot Vee, so he shoots her in the stomach.\n\nJust then, Tommy and his hackers modify ''Nerve\u2019''s source code to decrypt the watcher's code names into their real names as well as sending them a message: \"You are an accessory to murder\". The watchers immediately all log out, closing all the servers and ending the game. Despondent over Vee's apparent death, Ian aims his gun at Ty, but Vee suddenly sits up, revealing that she and Ty had staged her murder to scare the watchers into disbanding ''Nerve'', shutting it down and becomes offline. Tommy's hacker friends restore the stolen money and identities.\n\nA few months later, Vee and Sydney have reconciled, Vee and Ian are a couple, and Vee is attending California Arts. Ian reveals his real name to be Sam whilst another person is secretly recording them on their phone.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n<!--order, names, character names per closing credits-->\n* [[Emma Roberts]] as Vee, a player of ''Nerve''.\n* [[Dave Franco]] as Ian / Sam, Vee's fellow player.\n* [[Emily Meade]] as Sydney, Vee's best friend.\n* [[Miles Heizer]] as Tommy, one of Vee's friends who has an unrequited crush on her.\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Nancy, Vee's mother.\n* [[Kimiko Glenn]] as Liv, one of Vee's friends.\n* [[Marc John Jefferies]] as Wes, one of Vee's friends.\n* [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Colson Baker]] as Ty, Vee's main opponent in the game.\n* Brian Marc as J.P.
