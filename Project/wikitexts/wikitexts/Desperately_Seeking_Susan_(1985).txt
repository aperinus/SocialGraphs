Set in New York City, the plot involves the interaction between two women \u2013 a bored housewife and a bohemian drifter \u2013 linked by various messages in the personals section of a newspaper.\n\nThe film was Madonna's first major screen role and also provided early roles for a number of other well-known performers, such as [[John Turturro]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]], [[Laurie Metcalf]] and [[Steven Wright]]. The screenplay was written by Leora Barish, and is said to have been given an uncredited rewrite by [[Craig Bolotin]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=March 1985: Madonna Goes Hollywood with 'Desperately Seeking Susan' |url=https://totally80s.com/article/march-1985-madonna-goes-hollywood-desperately-seeking-susan |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=Totally 80's |language=en}}</ref> ''Desperately Seeking Susan'' was a commercial success and ended as the fifth-highest grossing film of the year grossing $27.3 million in the United States.<ref name=\"Rettenmund\"/> The film received predominantly positive reviews,<ref name=\"Rettenmund\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopdia-madonnica/page/87/mode/2up?q=copies|title=Desperately Seeking Susan|work=Encyclopedia Madonnica|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|access-date=January 16, 2022|date=1995|page=48|first=Matthew|last=Rettenmund|author-link=Matthew Rettenmund}}</ref> and both Arquette and Madonna's acting were critically acclaimed.<ref name=\"King\">{{cite book|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/madonnabook00king/page/98/mode/2up?q=acclaim|title=The Wannabes|chapter=10|work=Madonna|publisher=[[William Morrow and Company]]|access-date=January 17, 2022|date=1991|page=103|first=Norman|last=King}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' named it one of the ten best films of 1985.\n\n== Plot ==\nRoberta Glass, an unfulfilled housewife in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]], is fascinated by messages between lovers Susan Thomas and Jim Dandy in the [[Personal advertisement|personals section]] of a [[New York City]] tabloid, particularly a column from Jim with the headline \u201cDesperately Seeking Susan\u201d, seeking a rendezvous in [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]]. In an [[Atlantic City]] hotel, the itinerant Susan reads the column after a tryst with mobster Bruce Meeker. She steals a pair of ornate [[Egypt]]ian earrings from his coat before departing; the sinister Wayne Nolan notices Susan's embellished [[Black tie|tuxedo]] jacket as she leaves. Arriving in New York City, Susan dons one of the earrings, stashing the other in her suitcase in a [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|Port Authority]] locker. She asks to stay with her friend Crystal, a magician's assistant at the Magic Club, and learns Meeker was killed at the hotel.\n\nHoping to spot the lovers, Roberta goes to Battery Park and sees Jim reunite with Susan before leaving with his band for [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. Roberta follows Susan to a vintage store, watching her trade in her jacket before losing sight of her, and buys the jacket. Finding Susan's locker key in the pocket of the jacket, she posts another \u201cDesperately Seeking Susan\u201d column to meet with her to return it. Concerned about the column and Susan's connection to Meeker's death, Jim asks his best friend Dez to check on her.\n\nWaiting for Susan at Battery Park and wearing her jacket, Roberta is accosted by Nolan, mistaking her for Susan because she's blonde and wearing the distinctive jacket. Susan spots Roberta, but can't reach her as police chase her for not paying her taxicab fare. Dez arrives on a moped and rescues Roberta, who falls and hits her head, losing her memory and her bag. Dez believes she is Susan and, finding the locker key, he takes her to the Port Authority to collect Susan's suitcase. She finds the other earring, and Dez says she can stay at his apartment for one night.\n\nBelieving she must be Susan, Roberta retraces Susan's steps with Nolan in pursuit. She arrives at the Magic Club \u2013 narrowly missing Susan, who has been released from jail and discovered her suitcase gone \u2013 and is hired as Crystal's replacement. After Roberta's disastrous first performance, Nolan attacks her, demanding the earrings, but he escapes as the police arrive. Roberta hits her head again, regaining her memory, but is mistaken for a prostitute and arrested.\n\nMeanwhile, searching for Roberta, her husband Gary, who is revealed to be in the midst of a casual affair, finds his way to the vintage store and is put in touch with Susan, who believes Roberta and Dez are connected to Meeker's death and want to frame her. Susan arranges to meet Gary at a dance club and accompanies him home, where they get high. Roberta calls from jail, but hangs up when Susan and Gary answer. After calling Dez to bail her out, they find his apartment ransacked by Nolan, and sleep together.\n\nAt Gary's house, Susan sees a television report about Meeker and Nolan having stolen the earrings, once belonging to [[Nefertiti]]. She realizes the truth from Roberta's diary, and posts a column to meet her at the Magic Club. Dez attacks an intruder in his apartment who turns out to be Jim, and confesses to his relationship with \u201cSusan\u201d as Roberta slips away. She reads the column, as do Jim and Dez; they arrive at the Magic Club, along with Gary, his sister Leslie, and Nolan. During her act, Roberta recognizes Nolan, who escapes backstage. Dez leaves as Roberta tries to explain the events of her disappearance to Gary, finally voicing her unhappiness and ending their marriage. Nolan threatens Susan at gunpoint, but is knocked out by Roberta. There, Roberta and Susan finally meet each other for the first time.\n\nLater, Roberta finds Dez in a projection booth at the movie theater where he works. She introduces herself once again and they kiss, as Jim and Susan reunite in the theater below. The closing frames show Roberta and Susan celebrated as heroes in the newspaper and credited with returning the stolen earrings.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Rosanna Arquette]] as Roberta Glass\n* [[Aidan Quinn]] as Dez\n* [[Robert Joy]] as Jim Dandy, Susan's boyfriend\n* [[Mark Blum]] as Gary Glass, Roberta's husband\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as Leslie Glass, Roberta's sister-in-law\n* [[Will Patton]] as Wayne Nolan\n* [[Madonna]] as Susan Thomas\n* [[Anna Thomson|Anna Levine]] as Crystal\n* [[Peter Maloney (actor)|Peter Maloney]] as Ian, a magician\n* [[Steven Wright]] as Larry Stillman D.D.S.\n* [[John Turturro]] as Ray, the master of ceremonies at the Magic Club\n* [[Anne Carlisle]] as Victoria\n* Jos\u00e9 Angel Santana (as Jose Santana) as Boutique Owner\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as Street Vendor\n* [[Richard Hell]] as Bruce Meeker\n\nSeidelman employed a wide range of artists in small appearances, including comedian [[Rockets Redglare]] as a taxi driver; former member of [[the Shirts]] [[Annie Golden]] as a band singer; performance artist [[Ann Magnuson]] as a cigarette girl; musician and painter [[John Lurie]] as the neighbor saxophonist;  La Mama and Living Theatre member [[Shirley Stoler]] as a jail matron; [[Ambitious Lovers]] member [[Arto Lindsay]] as the newspaper clerk who places the \"seeking\" ads; and future [[Seinfeld]]-writer [[Carol Leifer]] as a party guest. Other notable appearances include actors [[Richard Edson]] as a man with newspapers, [[Victor Argo]] as Sgt. Taskal, [[Kim Chan]] as a park bum, and [[Michael Badalucco]] as a guy from Brooklyn. Triplets [[Three Identical Strangers|Eddy, David and Robert]] make an uncredited cameo as themselves.\n\n== Production ==\nThe filmmakers initially wanted [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Goldie Hawn]] to play Roberta and Susan, but the director decided to cast newcomers Arquette and Madonna instead and the studio wanted the movie to have younger actors in order to appeal to younger filmgoers. [[Bruce Willis]] was up for the role of Dez and [[Melanie Griffith]] was up for the role of Susan. Madonna barely obtained the role over [[Ellen Barkin]] and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]. [[Suzanne Vega]] also auditioned for the role.\n\nThe [[Statue of Liberty]] can be seen in the movie when it was still covered in scaffolding during its two-year renovation. Costume designer [[Santo Loquasto]] designed Susan's distinctive jacket (supposedly first worn by [[Jimi Hendrix]]), basis of the plot of mistaken identity.\n\nThe movie was inspired in part by the movie ''[[Celine and Julie Go Boating|C\u00e9line et Julie vont en bateau]]'' (''C\u00e9line and Julie Go Boating'') (1974).<ref>{{cite book|first=Guy|last=Austin|date=2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Bbxa3q3ZZAC&q=C%C3%A9line+et+Julie+vont+en+bateau&pg=PA64|title=Contemporary French Cinema: An Introduction By Guy Austin|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|location=New York City|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-7190-4610-0|page=64|via=[[Google Books]]|access-date=February 4, 2015}}</ref> It also has an alternate ending included on the DVD, in which Susan and Roberta are invited to Egypt after helping return the earrings. They are depicted next to the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] on camels. Seidelman cut this scene, saying that it was unnecessary and audiences at the test screenings thought the film should have already ended much earlier (as explained on the DVD). The science fiction film ''[[The Time Travelers (1964 film)|The Time Travelers]]'' (1964) is playing in scenes 6 and 23 (melts at the movie's ending). All the scenes featuring Dez working as a projectionist were filmed at [[Bleecker Street Cinema]]. The scene with Roberta and Gary in their kitchen shows Roberta watching [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940).\n\nThe movie was filmed during the late summer and early fall of 1984, early in Madonna's rise to popularity, and was intended to be an [[Motion Picture Association film rating system|R-rated]] feature. After the success of her 1984\u201385 hits \"[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]\" and \"[[Material Girl]]\" from her ''[[Like a Virgin (album)|Like a Virgin]]'' album, the movie was trimmed in content by [[Orion Pictures]] to get a PG-13 rating in order to also market the film to Madonna's teenage fanbase.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ybUBAAAAMBAJ&q=%22desperately%20seeking%20susan%22&pg=PA111|title=Brief Reviews|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=[[New York Media]]|location=New York Media|date=May 27, 1985|page=111}}</ref>\n\nThe interior and exterior shots of The Magic Club were filmed at the [[Audubon Ballroom]] in Harlem.<ref>{{cite AV media |last1=Peyser|first1=Michael|title=Desperately Seeking Susan 25: Sarah Pillsbury & Michael Peyser on the Magic Club|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIglclqwVm0 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309062048/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIglclqwVm0 |archive-date=2016-03-09 |url-status=dead|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=September 24, 2010}}</ref> Some scenes were filmed at [[Danceteria]], a club that Madonna frequented and which gave her a start in the music business.\n\nSeparated-at-birth triplets [[Three Identical Strangers|Robert Shafran, Eddy Galland and David Kellman]] have a cameo role, reportedly at Madonna's personal invitation.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stewart|first1=Sara|title=These Triplets Were Separated at Birth for a Sick Scientific Experiment|url=https://nypost.com/2018/01/23/these-triplets-were-separated-at-birth-for-a-sick-scientific-experiment/|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[New York Media]]|location=New York City|date=January 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe soundtrack was released on both vinyl and CD together with the soundtrack to the film ''[[Making Mr. Right]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Thomas-Newman-Chaz-Jankel-Desperately-Seeking-Susan-Making-Mr-Right-The-Films-Of-Susan-Seidelman-Ori/release/11691870|website=Discogs|title= Thomas Newman / Chaz Jankel* \u2013 Desperately Seeking Susan / Making Mr. Right (The Films of Susan Seidelman: Original Motion Picture Soundtracks) }}</ref> The soundtrack does not feature any of the other songs in the film including Madonna's \"[[Into the Groove]]\", which can be found on the European 1985 re-release of ''[[Like a Virgin (album)|Like a Virgin]]''. The film captures the feel of the underground Bohemian/[[New wave music|new wave]] scene of the early to mid-1980s New York City, a scene that helped Madonna get her big break in the music business. Madonna recorded a song for the movie, titled \"Desperately Seeking Susan\". It ended up not being used in the film, and a demo she just finished at the time called \"Into the Groove\" was used instead. The demo version can only be heard in the movie. The song was a huge commercial success but was not included on the film's soundtrack, despite being heard in the film, because licensing restrictions involving Madonna's record label prohibited her songs from being mixed in with other artists. The video for \"Into the Groove\" consists of clips from the film compiled by Doug Dowdle of Parallax Productions.\n\n{{track listing\n| headline  = '''Desperately Seeking Susan''' \n| all_music = [[Thomas Newman]]\n| title1    = Leave Atlantic City!\n| length1   = 2:33\n| title2    = Port Authority by Night\n| length2   = 1:14\n| title3    = New York City by Day\n| length3   = 1:06\n| title4    = Through the Viewscope\n| length4   = 0:40\n| title5    = St. Mark's Place\n| length5   = 1:30\n| title6    = A Key and a Picture Of\n| length6   = 1:22\n| title7    = Battery Park / Amnesia\n| length7   = 1:06\n| title8    = Jail / Port Authority by Day\n| length8   = 2:22\n| title9    = Rain\n| length9   = 0:51\n| title10   = Running With Birds in Cages\n| length10  = 1:11\n| title11   = Trouble Almost\n| length11  = 0:43\n}}\n\n== Critical reception ==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has rating of 84% based on 31 reviews.
