It stars an [[ensemble cast]] that consists of [[Will Smith]], [[Bill Pullman]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Mary McDonnell]], [[Judd Hirsch]], [[Margaret Colin]], [[Randy Quaid]], [[Robert Loggia]], [[James Rebhorn]], and [[Harvey Fierstein]]. The film focuses on disparate groups of people who converge in the [[Great Basin Desert|Nevada desert]] in the aftermath of a worldwide attack by a powerful [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial race]]. With the other people of the world, they launch a counterattack on July 4\u2014[[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] in the United States.\n\nWhile promoting ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' in Europe, Emmerich conceived the film while answering a question about his belief in the existence of alien life. Devlin and Emmerich decided to incorporate a large-scale attack having noticed that aliens in most invasion films travel long distances in outer space only to remain hidden when reaching Earth. Shooting began on July 28, 1995, in [[New York City]], and the film was completed on October 8, 1995.\n\nConsidered a significant turning point in the history of the [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], ''Independence Day'' was at the forefront of the large-scale [[disaster film]] and sci-fi resurgence of the mid-late 1990s. It was released worldwide on July 3, 1996, but began showing on July 2 (the same day the film's story begins) in original release as a result of a high level of anticipation among moviegoers. The film received mixed reviews, with praise for the performances, musical score and visual effects but criticism for its characters. It grossed over $817.4&nbsp;million worldwide,<ref name=\"BOM\" /> becoming the [[1996 in film|highest-grossing film of 1996]] and the [[List of highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film ever at the time]]<!-- Peak position only. -->, behind ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993). The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Academy Award for Best Sound]].\n\nThe sequel, ''[[Independence Day: Resurgence]]'', was released 20 years later on June 24, 2016, as part of a planned [[Independence Day (franchise)|series of films]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be between 400-700 words. -->\nOn July 2, 1996, an enormous extraterrestrial [[mothership]] enters Earth's orbit and deploys multiple saucers, each {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} wide, over major cities worldwide, including [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[Washington, D.C.]].\n\n[[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] Captain Steven Hiller and his unit, the [[VMFA-314|Black Knights fighter squadron]] out of [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro|MCAS El Toro]], are called-back from [[Independence Day (United States)|fourth of July]] [[Shore leave|liberty]] to defend [[Los Angeles]]; his girlfriend, Jasmine Dubrow, decides to flee the city with her son, Dylan. In [[New York City]], David Levinson, an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal embedded within global satellite transmissions, realizing it is the aliens' countdown for a coordinated attack. With help from his ex-wife, [[White House Communications Director]] Constance Spano, David and his father Julius reach the [[Oval Office]] and alert [[President of the United States|President]] Thomas Whitmore.\n\nWhitmore orders evacuations of the targeted cities in the US, but it is too late. Each saucer fires a [[directed-energy weapons|destructive beam]], incinerating all of the targeted cities, killing millions. Whitmore, the Levinsons and a few others escape aboard [[Air Force One]] while Jasmine, Dylan, and their dog Boomer take shelter in a tunnel's inspection alcove, emerging once the destruction is over.\n\nOn July 3, counterattacks against the invaders are thwarted by the alien warships' [[Force field (fiction)|force fields]]. Each saucer launches a swarm of shielded fighters which decimate the human fighter squadrons and military bases. Captain Hiller's entire squadron is wiped-out, including his best friend and wingman Jimmy. Hiller lures an enemy fighter into the [[Grand Canyon]] before ejecting from his plane, bringing down the alien fighter using his parachute and causing the fighter to crash in the [[Mojave Desert]]. He subdues the downed alien and flags down a convoy of refugees, transporting the alien to [[Area 51]], where Whitmore's group has landed.\n\n[[United States Secretary of Defense|Defense Secretary]] Albert Nimzicki reveals that a government faction has been involved in a [[UFO conspiracy theory|UFO conspiracy]] since 1947 when one of the invaders' fighters crashed in [[Roswell UFO incident|Roswell]]. Area 51 houses the now-refurbished ship and three alien corpses recovered from the crash. As chief scientist Dr. Brackish Okun examines the alien captured by Steven, it awakens, [[Telepathy|telepathically]] invades Okun's mind and launches a [[psychic]] attack against Whitmore before it is killed by [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents and military personnel. Whitmore reveals what he learned when they were linked: the invaders plan to annihilate Earth's inhabitants and steal their natural resources, as they have done to other planets before them.\n\nWhitmore reluctantly authorizes a trial nuclear attack against a saucer above [[Houston]], but the ship survives. Jasmine and Dylan commandeer a highway maintenance truck and rescue a handful of survivors, including a critically injured [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] Marilyn Whitmore. Though they are found by Hiller and taken to Area 51, Marilyn dies shortly after being reunited with her family.\n\nOn [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]], taking inspiration from his father, David writes a [[computer virus]] from his [[PowerBook 5300|laptop]] to disrupt the aliens' shields' [[operating system]] and devises a plan to upload it into the mothership from the refurbished alien fighter, which Hiller volunteers to pilot. The [[U.S. military]] contacts surviving airborne squadrons around the world through [[Morse code]] to organize a united counter-offensive. Lacking pilots, Whitmore and General William Grey enlist volunteers with flight experience, including retired combat pilot Russell Casse from the refugee camp at the base, to fly the remaining jets at Area 51; Whitmore leads an attack on a saucer bearing down on the base, overseen by Grey.\n\nHiller marries Jasmine with David and Constance in attendance before Hiller and David leave on the mission. Entering the mothership, they upload the virus and deploy a nuclear missile, destroying it and the aliens' reinforcements. With the aliens' shields deactivated, Whitmore's squadron combat the enemy fighters, but exhaust their ammunition before they can destroy the saucer. As the saucer prepares to fire on the base, Russell's last missile is unable to fire; he sacrifices himself by crashing into the saucer's weapon, destroying the warship. Military forces worldwide are notified of the alien ships' critical weakness and destroy the others. As humanity rejoices, Hiller and Levinson reunite with their families.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Please do not change the order of the cast listing, as shown in the film's end credits.
