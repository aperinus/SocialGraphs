Ward]], that stars [[Tom Berenger]], [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Wesley Snipes]], [[James Gammon]], [[Bob Uecker]], [[Rene Russo]], [[Margaret Whitton]], [[Dennis Haysbert]], and [[Corbin Bernsen]].\n\nMade for $11 million, ''Major League'' grossed $75 million worldwide. ''Major League'' deals with the exploits of a fictionalized version of the [[Cleveland Guardians|Cleveland Indians]] baseball team. It is the first installment in the ''Major League'' film series and spawned two sequels (''[[Major League II]]'' and ''[[Major League: Back to the Minors]]''), neither of which repeated the success of the original film.\n\n==Plot==\nFormer [[Las Vegas]] [[showgirl]] Rachel Phelps inherits the [[Cleveland Indians]] baseball team from her deceased husband. She hates [[Cleveland]] and intends to move the team to Miami by exploiting an [[escape clause]] in their contract if their season attendance remains low. She instructs general manager Charlie Donovan to fire the entire team and replace them with ageing and rookie players to make the worst team in the [[Major League Baseball|major leagues]]. Donovan brings on Lou Brown, the manager of the [[Toledo Mud Hens]] as coach. \n\n[[Spring training]] begins in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. Brown asks former Indians catcher, Jake Taylor, to lead the team despite his bad knees. Among other players include third baseman Roger Dorn, a [[prima donna]] star player; veteran pitcher Eddie Harris, who has resorted to [[Cheating in baseball#Doctoring the baseball|doctoring the baseball]]; outfielder Pedro Cerrano, a power-hitter who struggles to hit [[curveball]]s; outfielder Willie Mays Hayes, who can easily steal bases but has little batting power, and pitcher Rick Vaughn who has a wicked fastball but with no apparent control, earning him the nickname \"Wild Thing\".\n\nEarly on, the team struggles with their own interpersonal relationships but manage to win a few games. Brown and Taylor help to put the players' own troubles aside as the season progresses. Brown discovers Vaughn has poor eyesight and once fitted with glasses, he becomes a dominant pitcher. As team morale and performance improve, Phelps removes several amenities for the team, but they continue to soldier on. Meanwhile, Taylor discovers his old girlfriend Lynn and tries to rekindle their relationship. While they have a one-night stand, he learns she is engaged to be married soon.\n\nWith the Indians having a chance to win the division title, attendance has grown and Phelps' plan is in jeopardy. She informs Donovan that she will just fire the team, break contract, and move the team to Miami under a lucrative deal the city has offered her. Donovan relays this to Brown, who tells the team. They all agree that they only way to save their careers is to win the division. To encourage the team, Brown provides a cardboard cutout of Phelps from her showgirl days, with one piece of her clothing to be removed for each win.\n\nThe team succeeds in tying with the [[New York Yankees]] for first place in the [[American League East]] division, leading to a [[one-game playoff]] to determine the division championship. The Yankees take a 2-0 lead in the seventh inning, but Cerrano finally connects on a curveball and hits a 2-run homer to tie the game. Vaughn relieves Harris after the Yankees load the bases in the top of the ninth inning, and is able to strike out the Yankees' best hitter for the first time, maintaining the tie.\n\nThe Indians lose two outs in their half of the inning, but Hayes is able to get a single and then later steals second as Taylor is at bat. Taylor points to the outfield, mimicking [[Babe Ruth's called shot|Babe Ruth's famous called shot]], luring the Yankees to play deep in the field. Taylor bunts the ball, hurting his knees but safely making it to first base, giving Hayes the time to reach home for the winning run. As the team celebrates with fans, Taylor sees Lynn in the stands, no longer with her engagement ring, and she joins him in the celebration on the field.\n\n===Alternate ending===\nThe theatrical release includes added scenes of Rachel Phelps showing dismay with the team's success. An alternate scene included on the \"Wild Thing Edition\" DVD shows a very different characterization of Phelps. Lou Brown confronts Phelps over her plan to sabotage the team and announces his resignation. Phelps then reveals the threatened move to Miami was merely a ruse to motivate the team, as the Indians were on the verge of bankruptcy when she inherited them and she could not afford to hire star players or maintain standard amenities. She also tells Lou that she felt he was the right manager to bring the ragtag group together. Lou does not resign, but Phelps reasserts her authority by saying that if he shares any part of their conversation with anyone, she will fire him.<ref name=\"latimes altending\">{{cite web | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2010/07/sports-legend-revealed-the-movie-major-league-originally-had-a-twist-ending.html | title = The film Major League originally had a dramatic twist at the end involving the team's owner. | first = Brian | last = Cronin | date = July 20, 2010 | access-date = August 10, 2015 | website = [[Los Angeles Times]] }}</ref>\n\nThe film's producers said that while the twist ending worked as a resolution of the plot, they scrapped it because [[test screening|test audiences]] preferred the Phelps character as a villain.<ref name=\"latimes altending\"/>\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tom Berenger]] as Jake Taylor, a veteran [[catcher]] with bad knees.

The production used members of the [[University of Arizona]] Wildcats baseball team as extras.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tucson.com/entertainment/movies/modern-movies-that-were-filmed-in-tucson/collection_b9eceffe-63c5-11e5-80d6-8312ff318885.html#1|title = 5 'modern movies' that were filmed in Tucson}}</ref>\n\nDespite being set in Cleveland, the film was principally shot in Milwaukee because it was cheaper and the producers were unable to work around the schedules of the Cleveland Indians and [[Cleveland Browns]]. [[Milwaukee County Stadium]], then the home of the Brewers (and three [[Green Bay Packers]] games per season), doubles as [[Cleveland Stadium]] for the film, although several exterior shots of Cleveland Stadium were used, including some aerial shots taken during an Indians game. In fact, the sign for the television station atop the scoreboard is for [[WTMJ-TV]], the NBC affiliate for Milwaukee. One of the ending scenes of the movie is in West Milwaukee's legendary restaurant, 4th Base which showcases their unique horseshoe bar that is shown in the celebration scenes.  Another restaurant scene, at the then Gritz's Pzazz on Milwaukee's north side, is no longer open for business. County Stadium has since been [[demolition|demolished]]: the former playing field is now a [[Little League]] baseball field known as [[Helfaer Field]], while the rest of the former site is now a parking lot for the Brewers' current home, [[American Family Field]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Major League - Wild Thing Edition|work= [[DVD Talk]]|url= https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/27363/major-league-wild-thing-edition/|access-date=May 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nThe film was notable for featuring several actors who would go on to stardom: Snipes and Russo were relative unknowns before the movie was released, while Haysbert remained best known as Pedro Cerrano until he portrayed [[David Palmer (24 character)|U.S. President David Palmer]] on the television series ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' and the spokesperson for [[Allstate|Allstate Insurance]].  The longshoreman who is occasionally seen commenting and is shown in the final celebration inside a bar is [[Neil Flynn]], who later achieved fame playing the Janitor in ''[[Scrubs (TV Show)|Scrubs]]'' and then the father Mike in ''[[The Middle (TV series)|The Middle]]''.  This is Flynn's first credited movie role.\n\nThe film also featured former Major League players, including 1982 American League [[Cy Young Award]] winner [[Pete Vuckovich]] as Yankees' first baseman Clu Haywood, former [[Milwaukee Brewers]] pitcher [[Willie Mueller]] as the Yankees pitcher Duke Simpson, known as \"The Duke\", and former [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] catcher [[Steve Yeager]] as third-base coach Duke Temple.  Former catcher and longtime Brewers broadcaster [[Bob Uecker]] played the Indians' broadcaster, Harry Doyle. The names of several crewmembers were also used for peripheral players.\n\nSheen himself was a pitcher on his high school's baseball team. At the time of filming ''Major League'', his own fastball topped out at 88 miles per hour. In 2011, Sheen said that he had used [[Anabolic steroid|steroids]] for nearly two months to improve his athletic abilities in the film.<ref>{{cite news |author=Marianne Garvey |work=msnbc.com |title=Charlie Sheen used steroids during 'Major League'|date=June 29, 2011 |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/43578656/ns/today-entertainment/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701215740/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/43578656/ns/today-entertainment/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 1, 2011 |access-date=June 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film debuted at number 1 at the US box office<ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office: 'Major League' Wins Season Opener|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 11, 1989|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-11/entertainment/ca-1546_1_weeks-movie-million-weekend-box-office|access-date=May 15, 2012|first=Nina J.|last=Easton}}</ref> and received generally positive reviews.<ref>{{cite news|title= Movie Reviews : 'Major League' in a League by Itself|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 7, 1989|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-07/entertainment/ca-1041_1_major-league|access-date=May 14, 2012|first=Kevin|last=Thomas}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Reviews/Film; Idiocies and Idiosyncrasies Of Bungling Ballplayers|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=April 7, 1989|url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DE3D81539F934A35757C0A96F948260|access-date=May 14, 2012|first=Caryn|last=James}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Cinema: Don't Run: One Hit, One Error|work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=April 24, 1989|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957509,00.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101022073330/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957509,00.html|url-status= dead|archive-date= October 22, 2010|access-date=May 14, 2012|first=Richard|last=Corliss}}</ref> It grossed almost $50 million in the United States and Canada and $25 million internationally for a worldwide total of $75 million.<ref name=\"boxoffice\">{{cite web | title=Major League | website=Box Office Mojo | url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=majorleague.htm | access-date=May 27, 2006}}</ref><ref name=ww/>\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10.

She took over ownership and control of the Rams upon the death of her husband in 1979, and eventually moved the team to her hometown of [[St. Louis, Missouri]] in 1995. The Rams (at the time owned by [[Stan Kroenke]], who bought them from Frontiere's family after her own death) returned to Los Angeles in 2016.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}\n\nWhen he joined the Cubs in 1989 (the same year the film was released), pitcher [[Mitch Williams]]' extravagant wind-up and release, and his frequent wild pitches, earned him the nickname \"Wild Thing.\" As with Rick Vaughn's character, the [[Wrigley Field]] organist played \"[[Wild Thing (The Troggs song)|Wild Thing]]\" as Williams came out of the bullpen; this was changed to the rock recording from the film after he was traded to the Phillies. A few years later, in 1993 with the Phillies, Williams started wearing the number 99 on his jersey, the same number that Vaughn wears in the film.<ref>Although, according to an interview on ''[[The Dan Patrick Show]]'' (October 22, 2008), Williams' number change had nothing to do with the ''Major League'' film. Williams said he had wanted the number 99 for years because of his admiration for the football player [[Mark Gastineau]], who also wore number 99. Williams said that he did not change his number until 1993 because that was his first chance to do it.</ref>\n\nIn the years since its release ''Major League'' has become a beloved film of many professional baseball players and announcers, and is often referenced during game broadcasts.

A possible third sequel, ''Major League 3'' (which was to ignore ''Back to the Minors''), was reported in 2010 to be in development by original writer and producer [[David S. Ward]]. [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Tom Berenger]], and Snipes would return, with the plot revolving around Ricky Vaughn coming out of retirement to work with a young player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a232046/sheen-returning-for-third-major-league.html?rss |title=Sheen returning for third 'Major League'? - Movies News |website=Digital Spy |date=June 23, 2010 |access-date=July 8, 2012}}</ref> In 2015, [[Morgan Creek Productions]] announced that the sequel was still in the works.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jagernauth|first=Kevin|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/remakes-of-ace-ventura-pet-detective-the-exorcist-and-major-league-in-the-works-20150924|title=Remakes Of ''Ace Ventura: Pet Detective'', ''The Exorcist'', and ''Major League'' In the Works|work=[[Indiewire]]|date=September 24, 2015|access-date=May 15, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225154712/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/remakes-of-ace-ventura-pet-detective-the-exorcist-and-major-league-in-the-works-20150924|archive-date=December 25, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Reboot===\nIn 2017, Morgan Creek announced plans to reboot their classic films from the 1980s and 1990s as television series or movies following the success of [[The Exorcist (TV series)|''The Exorcist'']] television series.
