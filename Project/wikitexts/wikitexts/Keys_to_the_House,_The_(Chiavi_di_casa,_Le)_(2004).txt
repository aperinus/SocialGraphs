The film was [[Film director|directed]] by [[Gianni Amelio]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nGianni ([[Kim Rossi Stuart]]) has left his handicapped son Paolo ([[Andrea Rossi (actor)|Andrea Rossi]]) in the care of others since his birth. He has not been able to cope with Paolo\u2019s mother\u2019s death in childbirth or that Paolo has not developed like other children because of his handicap. Paolo is now fifteen and is about to meet his father for the first time. Gianni has been asked by his son's caretakers to bring him to a [[Berlin]] hospital for yearly tests and check-ups. According to their doctor, the \"shock\" of meeting his father could help Paolo in his treatment. \n \nWhen Gianni boards the night train on which Paolo is already travelling, it is Gianni who is in for a shock. Paolo does not seem particularly impressed nor disturbed by this first meeting with his biological father. He seems more interested in his Game Boy instead. Gianni and Nicole ([[Charlotte Rampling]]) meet accidentally in the Berlin hospital and, even though he feels awkward and almost ashamed at being seen as having fathered \"such a child\", they connect. Nicole has spent her life caring for her daughter and could teach Gianni something if only he were willing to listen. Through a series of chance encounters aided by a book left behind by Nicole (''Born Twice'' Italian title: ''Nati due volte'', incidentally the book on which the film is based), they meet several times and get talking.\n\n==Awards==\nThe film has won nine awards and fourteen nominations.\n\n===2004===\nIn the same year of its release (2004) it won four awards and one nomination in the [[Venice Film Festival]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
