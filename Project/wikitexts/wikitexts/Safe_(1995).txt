Set in 1987, it follows a suburban housewife in [[Los Angeles]] whose monotonous life is abruptly changed when she becomes sick with a mysterious illness caused by the environment around her.\n\nThe film topped the \"best film of the 1990s\" poll by ''The Village Voice'',<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOzFilLNcgrGzAeECAbUFCQ|title=\"Todd Haynes Q&A {{!}} Safe\", Retrospective of Todd Haynes films|date=25 November 2015|website=Film at Lincoln Center, YouTube|access-date=30 October 2019}}</ref><ref>[https://www.criterion.com/films/28548-safe Criterion Collection]</ref> and was described by critics as \"the scariest film of the year\",<ref name=\":13\" /> \"a mesmerizing horror movie\",<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/saferkempley_c026c9.htm|title=Safe|last=Kempley|first=Rita|date=4 August 1995|work=The Washington Post|access-date=30 October 2019}}</ref> and \"a work of [[feminist cinema|feminist]] counter-cinema\".<ref>Geller, Theresa L. \"The Hardest, The Most Difficult Film: Todd Haynes\u2019 Safe as Feminist Film Praxis or what the fuck is this\u201d or \u201cAn Indelible Mark: Women and the Work of Todd Haynes\u201d, a presentation, Grinnell College, 2013. page 6.</ref> 20 years after the film's release, Haynes said its themes\u2014disease and immunity in a post-industrial landscape and how recovery is a burden often put on victims of illness\u2014were even more relevant than they were when the film was released.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\n==Plot==\nCarol White is a housewife living in an affluent suburb of [[Los Angeles]]. She passes her days with activities like gardening, aerobics, and seeing friends. Her marriage and family life appear stable but sterile, and her friends are polite but distant. Following the renovation of the family's home, Carol suddenly starts experiencing physical symptoms when she is around certain everyday chemicals: she coughs uncontrollably when breathing exhaust fumes from a nearby truck while driving, has breathing difficulties at a baby shower, and suffers from a nosebleed while getting a perm at a hair salon. As her symptoms worsen, the chemicals that are triggering them seem ubiquitous. Finally, she has a complete collapse while at her dry cleaners that is being fumigated with pesticides.\n\nDoctors have no idea how to cure or help Carol. She attends some [[psychotherapy]] sessions, but her symptoms are not alleviated. She finds that she is very alone with her disease when her community behaves indifferently towards her. Accepting that she can no longer function in her current life, she leaves her home, possessions, and life behind. Without her husband, she moves to Wrenwood, an eerie new-age desert community for people with environmental illnesses. Wrenwood, which has cult-like aspects, is led by a man whose relentless motivational talks amount to \"psychological fascism\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=2255|title=''Safe'' (1995)|last=Gonsalves|first=Rob|date=21 May 2006|website=E-Film Critic|access-date=6 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nEven in a community of people with similar health issues, Carol seems to become more isolated. She moves into an igloo separated from the rest of the community.
