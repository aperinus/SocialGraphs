It was produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution Company]].\n\nIt was one of several films made by Disney using the setting of Medfield College, first used in the 1961 Disney film ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]'' and its sequel ''[[Son of Flubber]]''. Both sequels to ''The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes'', ''[[Now You See Him, Now You Don't]]'' and ''[[The Strongest Man in the World]]'', were also set at Medfield.\n\n== Plot ==\nDexter Reilly ([[Kurt Russell]]) and his friends attend small, private Medfield College, which cannot afford to buy a computer. The students persuade wealthy businessman A. J. Arno ([[Cesar Romero]]) to donate an old computer to the college. Arno is secretly the head of a large illegal gambling ring which used the computer for its operations.\n\nWhile installing a replacement computer part during a thunderstorm, Reilly receives an electric shock and becomes a [[human computer]]. He now has superhuman mathematical talent, can [[speed reading|read]] and [[eidetic memory|remember the contents]] of an encyclopedia volume in a few minutes, and can [[multilingualism|speak a language fluently]] after reading one textbook. His new abilities make him a worldwide celebrity and Medfield's best chance to win a televised [[Quiz bowl|quiz tournament]] with a [[United States dollar|$]]100,000 prize.\n\nReilly single-handedly leads Medfield's team in victories against other colleges. During the tournament, on live television, a trigger word (\"[[Applejack (drink)|applejack]]\") causes him to unknowingly recite details of Arno's gambling ring. Arno's [[henchmen]] kidnap Reilly and plan to kill him, but his friends help him escape by locating the house in which he is being kept, posing as house painters to gain access, and sneaking him out in a large trunk.  During the escape, he suffers a [[concussion]] which, during the tournament final against rival Springfield State, gradually returns his mental abilities to normal; however, one of his friends, Schuyler, is able to answer the final question (\"A small Midwest city is located exactly on an area designated as the [[geographic center of the contiguous United States|geographic center of the United States]].  For 10 points and $100,000, can you tell us the name of that city?\" with the answer \"[[Lebanon, Kansas]]\"). Medfield wins the $100,000 prize. Arno and his henchmen are arrested when they attempt to escape the TV studio and crash head-on into a police car.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as Dexter Reilly\n* [[Cesar Romero]] as A.
