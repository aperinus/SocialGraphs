It grossed $141.3 million against a budget of $19 million, becoming [[List of highest-grossing R-rated films#Highest-grossing R-rated animated films|the highest-grossing R-rated animated film]] at the time until it was surpassed by ''[[Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 The Movie: Mugen Train|Demon Slayer: Mugen Train]]'' in 2020.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nUnbeknownst to humans, a supermarket called Shopwell's is filled with [[anthropomorphic]] grocery items that believe that the human shoppers are gods who take purchased groceries to a [[utopia]] known as the \"Great Beyond\". Among the store's groceries is a sausage named Frank, who dreams of living in the Great Beyond with his hot dog bun girlfriend Brenda and his friends Carl and Barry.\n\nFrank and Brenda's packages are purchased by a female shopper. On their way out of the store, a returned jar of honey mustard tries to warn the groceries that the Great Beyond is not what it is said to be, but nobody listens except Frank. Before committing suicide by falling onto the shop floor, Honey Mustard tells Frank to seek out a bottle of liquor named Firewater. Honey Mustard's suicide creates an accidental cart collision that causes Frank, Brenda and several groceries to fall out of the cart, including a Jewish [[bagel]] named Sammy Bagel Jr., a Middle-Eastern [[lavash]] named Kareem Abdul Lavash and an nasty aggressive [[douche]] who, after his nozzle is bent on impact, swears revenge on Frank and Brenda.\n\nSeeking to verify Honey Mustard's warning, Frank leads Brenda, Sammy and Lavash to the store's liquor aisle. There, he meets Firewater and learns that Firewater and his colleagues, the Non-Perishables, created the [[white lie]] of the Great Beyond to assuage the inhabitants' fear of being eaten. Frank vows to reveal the truth and is encouraged to travel beyond the store's freezer section to find proof, while Brenda, Sammy and Lavash are brought to the Mexican food aisle by a bottle of tequila, who is secretly working for Douche, until a lesbian [[taco]] named Teresa del Taco, who develops a crush on Brenda, helps them escape Douche.\n\nMeanwhile, at the shopper\u2019s house, Carl and Barry are horrified to see the shopper eat all of the foods. Carl spots a nearby open window but he is killed from being stabbed and sliced upwards by the shopper, leaving Barry to escape alone.\n\nBarry then encounters a human drug addict, who becomes able to communicate with his groceries, one of them being [[Chewing gum|Gum]], a [[Stephen Hawking]]-like wad of chewing gum, after injecting himself with [[Bath salts (drug)|bath salts]]. However, the bath salts soon wear off and the addict prepares to cook Barry. The Addict accidentally burns himself and Barry yanks his shoelaces, making him slip and causing an axe to fall and decapitate him.\n\nFrank's friends disapprove of his skepticism of the Great Beyond. He discovers a cookbook beyond the freezer section and reveals its contents to the store's inhabitants. They panic at first, but then shortly refuse to believe Frank until Barry, Gum, and the other groceries from the addict's home return with the addict's severed head, proving that the humans can be killed. The group drugs the human shoppers and employees with toothpicks laced with bath salts, whereupon an epic battle begins. Several humans are gruesomely killed while Douche takes control of Darren, the store manager (parody of [[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]). He confronts Frank about becoming a god now that he is in control of Darren and takes a bite out of Frank's torso. Brenda saves Frank as Barry and the other groceries catch Douche and Darren in a garbage pail strapped to propane tanks. They are then launched out of the store as the tanks explode, killing them both.\n\nThe inhabitants celebrate their victory with a massive [[orgy]]. Later, Frank and his friends visit Firewater, who had a [[psychedelic experience]] and discovered that [[Fourth wall|their world is not what they think]]; they are merely animated characters voiced by famous actors in [[Parallel universes in fiction|another dimension]]. Gum has constructed a [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] to this dimension, and the group decide to travel there to confront their creators.\n\n==Voice cast==\n<!-- poster billing -->\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Frank, a sausage who sets out to discover and expose the truth about the \"Great Beyond\".<ref name=\"ColliderPixarApart\">{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Matt|title=Writer Evan Goldberg and Executive Producer James Weaver Talk R-Rated Animated Film SAUSAGE PARTY; Pixar Movies Will Get \"Ripped Apart\"|url=https://collider.com/sausage-party-story-details-evan-goldberg/|publisher=Collider.com|access-date=June 1, 2014|date=May 6, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"announces\" /><ref name=\"ColliderRogenNeighbors\">{{cite web|last=Wintraub|first=Steve|title=Seth Rogen Talks ''Neighbors'', Expanding Rose Byrne's Role, the R-rated Animated Comedy ''Sausage Party'', ''The Interview'', ''Preacher'', and More|url=https://collider.com/the-interview-seth-rogen-preacher-neighbors/|publisher=Collider.com|access-date=May 8, 2014|date=May 7, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Michael Cera]] as Barry, a deformed sausage who is one of Frank's friends.<ref name=\"ColliderPixarApart\" /><ref name=\"ColliderRogenNeighbors\" /><ref name=\"thewrap-casting\" />\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Brenda, a hot dog bun who is Frank's love interest.<ref name=\"ColliderRogenNeighbors\" /><ref name=\"thewrap-casting\" />\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Sammy Bagel Jr., a neurotic Jewish bagel who has an on-and-off rivalry with Lavash.<ref name=\"ColliderPixarApart\" /><ref name=\"ColliderRogenNeighbors\" /><ref name=\"thewrap-casting\" />\n* [[David Krumholtz]] as Kareem Abdul Lavash, a Middle Eastern lavash who has an on-and-off rivalry with Sammy.
