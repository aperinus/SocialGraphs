The experiments give Jobe superhuman abilities, but also increases his aggression, turning him into a man obsessed with evolving into a digital being.\n\nThis film was adapted from an original screenplay entitled \"CyberGod\". The title comes from a [[The Lawnmower Man|1975 short story]] by [[Stephen King]]. Both stories involved a gardener who operates a lawnmower, but the film has little similarity to King's story, which involves a [[satyr]] who makes human sacrifices to the Greek god [[Pan (god)|Pan]]. Originally titled ''Stephen King's The Lawnmower Man'', King successfully sued to have his name removed from the credits. He won further damages when his name was included in the title of the home video release.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stephen King wins lawsuit|url=https://ew.com/article/1994/04/22/stephen-king-wins-lawsuit/|access-date=9 May 2022|website=Ew.com}}</ref>\n\nA sequel, ''[[Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace]]'', was released in 1996, with [[Austin O'Brien]] as the only returning actor from the original film.\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Lawrence Angelo works for Virtual Space Industries and runs experiments using [[psychoactive drug]]s and [[virtual reality]] to enhance cognitive performance, using [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s as test subjects, in an experiment labeled \"Project 5\". Angelo has benevolent aims, but VSI is funded by \"The Shop\", a clandestine group hoping to find military applications for Angelo's research. One of the chimpanzees, \"Rosco,\" gifted with new intelligence, warfare training, and increased aggression, escapes, and after being hunted, is executed by the laboratory's security forces. Angelo consequently decides to recruit [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] [[gardener]] Jobe Smith as a test subject, telling the man he will become smarter. Angelo redesigns the intelligence-boosting treatments to remove the \"aggression factors\" used in the chimpanzee experiments. Not only is Jobe's intelligence enhanced, but he also develops [[psychokinesis]] and [[telepathy]]. He continues training at the lab until an accident forces Angelo to abort the experiment.\n\nThe project director, Sebastian Timms, keeps tabs on the progress of the experiment and secretly swaps Angelo's new medications with the old Project 5 supply. When Jobe invites his new lover Marnie to the lab to engage in [[cybersex]], he accidentally lobotomises her. Jobe continues the treatments on his own and begins killing the people who mistreated him in the past, as well as the abusive father of his 10-year-old friend Peter. Angelo learns the drugs have been swapped and confronts Jobe, who captures him and declares his plan to reach an ultimate stage of [[evolution]] by becoming a being of \"pure energy\" existing in the VSI computer [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]], connecting to all computer systems of the world afterward. He promises his \"birth\" will be signaled by every telephone on the planet ringing simultaneously.\n\nThe Shop sends a team to capture Jobe, but with his new abilities he scatters them to pieces. Jobe uses the lab equipment to enter the VSI mainframe and become a digital being, abandoning his physical body. Angelo remotely accesses the VSI computer, [[Encryption|encrypting]] connections to the outside world and trapping Jobe in the mainframe. As Jobe searches for an unencrypted network connection, Angelo sets bombs to destroy the building. Feeling responsible for what happened to Jobe, Angelo enters virtual reality to attempt reasoning with him one last time or die with him. Jobe overpowers Angelo and [[crucifixion|crucifies]] his digital body. Peter runs into the building and Jobe realizes he is in danger from the bombs. Still caring for the boy, he allows Angelo to leave the mainframe in order to rescue Peter. Jobe escapes through a [[backdoor (computing)|maintenance line]] just before the building is destroyed.\n\nAngelo is later at home with Peter and his mother Carla. The telephone rings, followed by the noise of a second telephone ringing elsewhere, followed by all telephones ringing all around the world.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Dr. Lawrence Angelo\n* [[Jeff Fahey]] as Jobe Smith\n* [[Jenny Wright]] as Marnie Burke\n* [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]] as Terry McKeen\n* [[Jeremy Slate]] as Father Francis McKeen\n* [[Dean Norris]] as The Director\n* [[Austin O'Brien]] as Peter Parkette\n* [[Troy Evans (actor)|Troy Evans]] as Lieutenant Goodwin\n* Rosalee Mayeux as Carla Parkette\n* Mark Bringelson as Sebastian Timms\n* Ray Lykins as Harold Parkette\n* Colleen Coffey as Caroline Angelo\n\n==Production==\nThe plot of Stephen King's 1975 short story \"[[The Lawnmower Man]]\" concerns Harold Parkette, who hires \"Pastoral Greenery and Outdoor Services Inc.\" to cut his lawn. Parkette later spies on the serviceman, discovering his lawnmower mows the lawn by itself while he crawls after it, naked, eating the grass. The serviceman is actually a [[satyr]] who worships the Greek god [[Pan (god)|Pan]]. When Parkette tries to call the police, the mower and its owner ritually kill him as a sacrifice to Pan.\n\nThe film's original script, written by director [[Brett Leonard]] and producer [[Gimel Everett]], was written between May and August 1990 under the title ''The Lawnmower Man'', and carried minor elements of King's original story, including the scene where Jobe kills Peter's father with the lawnmower \"Big Red\", and the aftermath in which the police state that they found some of his remains in the birdbath. The addition of a government agency known as \"The Shop\" was drawn from separate works of King's, such as ''[[Firestarter (novel)|Firestarter]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Tommyknockers]]'' (1987).\n\nThe film has several elements in common with the 1959 [[Daniel Keyes]] novel ''[[Flowers for Algernon]]'', which also deals with a mentally disabled man whose intelligence is technologically boosted to genius levels. A similar parallel can be drawn with the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' television series (second pilot) episode of 1966 titled \"[[Where No Man Has Gone Before]]\".\n\nThe [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) was created for the film by [[Rockstar San Diego|Angel Studios]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Ultra 64 'Dream Team'|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=70 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1995|page=138}}</ref> The supervising sound editor was [[Frank Serafine]], who was hired as a result of his sound creation work in the 1982 film ''[[Tron]]''. [[Fuji TV|Fuji Creative]]'s [[Masao Takiyama]] is also credited as a co-producer.\n\n==Release==\n{{expand section|date=July 2016}}\nThe film was tested in Jacksonville, Florida, Fresno, California and Providence, Rhode Island on February 14, 1992<ref name=AFI/> and released in the United States on March 6, in 1,276 theatres.<ref name=\"BOM\"/>\n\nThe film was released in Japan under the title ''Virtual Wars''.\n\n==2017 Director's Cut==\nThe original theatrical release had a large element cut from it involving a chimpanzee. In the film's opening this chimpanzee escapes the lab and is helped by Jobe who then witnesses it shot dead. This then led to several other cuts throughout the film to remove call back to this plot element. In the Director's Cut these elements are noticeable as they have been taken from the film's original negative.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cinapse.co/a-tale-of-two-lawnmower-mans-98dc62a7b5df|title=A Tale of Two LAWNMOWER MANS|work=[[Cinapse]]|date=30 August 2017 |access-date=Aug 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\n{{As of|July 2022}}, the film held a 37% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 41 reviews.

A third [[court order]] was needed to force the studio's compliance. As before, the court upheld the two prior judgments, but it took the extra step of imposing a penalty of $10,000 directly payable to King for every day New Line remained in contempt by defying the order. Additionally, the studio would have to forfeit all profits earned on the film during that same period.\n\nThe film was released on [[Video CD|VCD]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=CD Films/Music|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=12 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=October 1996|page=97}}</ref> The [[DVD]], released in December 1997, contains only the theatrical cut, with scenes from the unrated edition being presented on the DVD as deleted scenes.\n\nIn February 1997, the director's cut was released in widescreen for the first time on double LaserDisc, featuring various special features on the C-side. The transfer used for the LaserDisc left King's name in the opening credits, but removed it from the title screen.\n\nThe director's cut was released on DVD with the inclusion of the sequel ''Lawnmower Man 2'' on October 25, 2010, in the United Kingdom, but this release suffered from poor [[NTSC]] quality transfer with the aspect ratio of 4:3 pan and scan, the extended scenes spliced-in but in the aspect ratio of 16:9.<ref>[http://www.jasonslater.co.uk/2010/10/01/new-release-the-lawnmower-man-directors-cut The Lawnmower Man Director\u2019s Cut] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101094504/http://www.jasonslater.co.uk/2010/10/01/new-release-the-lawnmower-man-directors-cut/ |date=2011-01-01}} at jasonslater.co.uk</ref>\n\nPrior to the US [[Shout!

Factory released ''The Lawnmower Man'' on Blu-ray for the first time in the United States in June 2017. The two-disc set includes new 4k digital restorations of the theatrical and director's cuts, [[audio commentary]] with director [[Brett Leonard]] and producer [[Gimel Everett]], an all-new retrospective documentary featuring Leonard and star [[Jeff Fahey]], and all of the bonus features from the original New Line DVD. For unknown reasons, a line of dialogue from the theatrical release related to the killing of a chimp (which makes no sense in the context of the plot of the director's cut - in that version, the chimp escaped from the VSI lab) was re-introduced to the director's cut.\n\nIn Australia, the only version of the film to be released was the theatrical cut - the director's cut was only available as a UK import. It was never released on DVD until 2008, when Force Entertainment released a budget DVD, containing the theatrical cut and the special features from the US DVD, on its own or as a two-pack with its sequel.\n\n==Sequel and other media==\nA graphic novel adaptation of the film was announced by [[Innovation Comics]] for April 1992 release,<ref>''Innovation Previews'' issue 22</ref> but was never published.\n\nA sequel, ''[[Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace]]'', was released in 1996 with [[Austin O'Brien]] as the only returning actor from the original film. It was retitled ''Lawnmower Man 2: Jobe's War'' for its video release. The film received negative reviews from critics and fans of the first movie.\n\nThe film spawned two video games: ''[[The Lawnmower Man (video game)|The Lawnmower Man]]'' in 1993, and ''[[Cyberwar (video game)|Cyberwar]]'' in 1994.\n\n[[Comic book]] writer [[Grant Morrison]] said in an interview<ref>[http://www.popimage.com/profile/morrison/012501_grant4.html Grant Morrison interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519150305/http://www.popimage.com/profile/morrison/012501_grant4.html |date=2006-05-19}} at popimage.com</ref> that they were contacted by the owners of the ''Lawnmower Man'' in 1995 and asked to write treatments for ''Lawnmower Man 2''. Morrison claims they were asked to \"bend the ''Lawnmower Man'' series in an [[X-Men]] superhero-type direction\". Neither of Morrison's script treatments was used and ''Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace'' was produced without their involvement.\n\nSome of the CGI footage of ''The Lawnmower Man'' was featured in the 1992 CG [[art film]] ''[[Mind's Eye (film series)|Beyond the Mind's Eye]]''.\n\nJaunt VR, a virtual reality studio, attempted to adapt the feature into a virtual reality experience with the original rights holders but ultimately went out of business before realizing its efforts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/lawnmower-man-vr-1201963942/|title=Jaunt to Remake 'Lawnmower Man' as Virtual Reality Series|first=Janko|last=Roettgers|date=19 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Short film==\nAn earlier short film, also titled ''The Lawnmower Man'', was directed by Jim Gonis in 1987.<ref>[http://www.stephen-king.tk/lawnmowerman.htm The Lawnmower Man] at Stephen-King.tk</ref> That film was a direct adaptation of the short story by King.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* [[Transcendence (2014 film)|''Transcendence'']]\n* [[Lucy (2014 film)|''Lucy'']]\n* ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{AFI film|59296}}\n* {{amg title|28590}}\n* {{mojo title|lawnmowerman}}\n* {{IMDb title|0104692}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|lawnmower_man}}\n\n{{Media based on Stephen King works}}\n{{Brett Leonard}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lawnmower Man, The}}\n[[Category:1992 films]]\n[[Category:1992 horror films]]\n[[Category:1990s science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:1992 independent films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:American films about revenge]]\n[[Category:Films about computing]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about consciousness transfer]]\n[[Category:Films about telepresence]]\n[[Category:Films about technological impact]]\n[[Category:Films about intellectual disability]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Brett Leonard]]\n[[Category:Films set in California]]\n[[Category:Films about virtual reality]]\n[[Category:Techno-thriller films]]\n[[Category:Cyberpunk films]]\n[[Category:Techno-horror films]]\n[[Category:Films shot from the first-person perspective]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Stephen King]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
