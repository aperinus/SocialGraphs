[[Ted Post]], who had previously worked with Eastwood on ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' and ''[[Hang 'Em High]]'', directed the film. The screenplay was written by [[John Milius]] and [[Michael Cimino]] (who later worked with Eastwood on ''[[Thunderbolt and Lightfoot]]''). The film score was composed by [[Lalo Schifrin]]. This film features early appearances by [[David Soul]], [[Tim Matheson]], and [[Robert Urich]]. At 122 minutes, it is the longest of the five ''Dirty Harry'' films.\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter being [[Acquittal|acquitted]] of a mass murder on a [[legal technicality]], mobster Carmine Ricca drives away from court in his limousine. While traveling on a city road, the driver is pulled over by a [[San Francisco Police Department]] (SFPD) [[Police officer|motorcycle cop]], who calmly guns down every man in the car. Inspector Harry Callahan visits the crime scene with his new partner, Earlington \"Early\" Smith, despite the fact that the two are supposed to be on stakeout duty. Their superior, Lieutenant Neil Briggs, seems eager to keep him out of the murder investigation.\n\nWhile visiting the airport, Callahan helps deal with two men trying to hijack an airplane. He later meets rookies Phil Sweet, John Davis, Alan \"Red\" Astrachan, and Mike Grimes while visiting the police firing range. Sweet is an ex-[[United States Army Ranger]] and [[Vietnam veteran]] with great marksmanship skills. His friends are not that different. Another motorcycle cop shoots up a pool party, again leaving behind no usable evidence of his crime.\n\nAs Callahan and Early take down criminals at a supermarket, a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] murders a prostitute for withholding money from him. The next day, the pimp is killed by a patrolman. While investigating the scene, Callahan realizes that the culprit is a cop. He assumes him to be his old friend Charlie McCoy, who has become despondent and suicidal after leaving his wife, Carol. Later, a motorcycle cop murders drug kingpin Lou Guzman. The killer, revealed to be Davis, encounters McCoy in the parking garage and guns him down.\n\nAt an annual shooting competition, Callahan learns that Davis was the first officer to arrive after the murders of Guzman and McCoy. Callahan retrieves a slug from Davis' Colt and has ballistics match it to the bullets from the Guzman murder. Callahan begins to suspect that a secret [[death squad]] within the SFPD is responsible for the killings. Briggs insists that Ricca's former associate, Frank Palancio, is the real culprit. Callahan persuades Briggs to assign Davis and Sweet as back up for a raid on Palancio's offices. However, Palancio and his gang are tipped off via a phone call, Sweet is killed by a shotgun blast, and all of Palancio's men die in the ensuing shootout with the police. Palancio attempts to escape, but Callahan jumps on the hood of his car, causing him to lose control and crash into a crane, killing him. Briggs angrily suspends Callahan for the death of Sweet. After returning home, Callahan finds Davis, Astrachan, and Grimes waiting for him, presenting him with an [[ultimatum]] to side with them; Callahan refuses. While checking his mailbox, Callahan discovers a bomb left by the [[Vigilantism|vigilantes]] and manages to defuse it. A second bomb, however, kills Early before Callahan can warn him.\n\nCallahan then learns that Briggs is the secret leader of the death squad. Briggs defends his actions, claiming that he is only doing what the broken legal system cannot. At gunpoint, Briggs orders Callahan to drive to an undisclosed location while being followed by Grimes. Callahan manages to disarm Briggs and force him out of the car before running Grimes over. Davis and Astrachan appear, causing Callahan to flee onto an [[USS Badoeng Strait|old aircraft carrier]] in a [[Ship breaking|shipbreaker's yard]]. Callahan kills Astrachan and takes his motorcycle, leading Davis in a series of jumps [[USS Rabaul|between ships]]. The chase ends with Davis driving off the ship into the [[San Francisco Bay]] and dying on impact. Callahan is then confronted at gunpoint by Briggs. The lieutenant mocks Callahan and threatens to have him prosecuted. As Callahan backs away from the car, he surreptitiously activates the timer on his mailbox bomb and tosses it in the back seat. Briggs is driving off when the bomb detonates, killing him in the explosion. Callahan then proclaims, \"A man's got to know his limitations.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Inspector [[Dirty Harry (character)|\"Dirty\" Harry Callahan]]{{efn|group=note|Harry's surname is spelled \"Calahan\" in the closing credits of ''Magnum Force.''

Eastwood specifically wanted to convey that, despite the 1971 film's perceived politics, Harry was not a complete vigilante. David Soul, Tim Matheson, Robert Urich, and Kip Niven were cast as the young vigilante cops.<ref name=\"McGilligan234\">McGilligan (1999), p.234</ref> Milius was a gun aficionado and political conservative, and the film would extensively feature gun shooting in practice, competition, and on the job.<ref name=\"McGilligan234\" /> Given this strong theme in the film, the title was soon changed from ''Vigilance'' to ''Magnum Force'' in deference to the [[.44 magnum]] that Harry liked to use. Milius thought it was important to remind the audiences of the original film by incorporating the line \"Do ya feel lucky?\" repeated in the opening credits.<ref name=\"McGilligan234\" />\n\nWith Milius committed to filming ''[[Dillinger (1973 film)|Dillinger]]'', [[Michael Cimino]] was later hired to revise the script, overseen by Ted Post, who was to direct. According to Milius, his script did not contain any of the final action sequences (the car chase and climax on the aircraft carriers). His was a \"simple script\".<ref name=\"commentary\">John Milius commentary on Magnum Force Deluxe Edition DVD</ref> The addition of the character Sunny was done at the suggestion of Eastwood, who reportedly received letters from women asking for \"a female to hit on Harry\" (not the other way around).<ref name=\"commentary\" />\n\nMilius later said he did not like the film and wished [[Don Siegel]] had directed it, as originally intended:\n\n{{blockquote|Of all the films I had anything to do with, I like it least. They changed a lot of things in a cheap and distasteful manner. The whole ending is wrong, it wasn't mine at all. All movies had a motorcycle or car chase at the time&nbsp;\u2014 except Westerns. They have a scene where this black girl's pimp forces [[Drano]] down her throat. In the script, they merely went into the morgue and Harry said, \"I don't feel bad for that son of a b****, 'cause two weeks ago one of his girls was in here and he'd poured Drano down her throat.\" I think it's better to hear about it than to see it later; also, it goes right back to the character again; you understand Harry's feelings about it. All the stuff they put in about the Japanese girl - they put in a scene where the star gets to f*** some girl, and it's pretty hard to get it out. My ''Dirty Harry'' scripts never had Harry knowing any girls too well other than hookers, because he was a lonely guy who lived alone and didn't like to associate with people. He could never be close enough to a woman to have any sort of affair. A bitter, lonely man who liked his work<ref name=\"comment\">{{cite news|title=STOKED|last=Thompson|first= Richard|newspaper= Film Comment 12.4|date=July 1976 | pages=10\u201321}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Directing ===\nEastwood himself was initially offered the role of director, but declined. Ted Post, who had previously directed Eastwood in [[Rawhide (TV series)|''Rawhide'']] and ''[[Hang 'Em High]]'', was hired. [[Buddy Van Horn]] was the [[second unit director]]. Both Eastwood and Van Horn went on to direct the final two entries in the series, ''[[Sudden Impact]]'' and ''[[The Dead Pool]]'', respectively.\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Frank Stanley (cinematographer)|Frank Stanley]] was hired as cinematographer. Filming commenced in late April 1973.<ref name=\"McGilligan234\" /> During filming, Eastwood encountered numerous disputes with Post over who was calling the shots in directing the film, and Eastwood refused to authorize two important scenes directed by Post in the film because of time and expenses; one of them was at the climax to the film with a long shot of Eastwood on his motorcycle as he confronts the rogue cops.<ref name=\"McGilligan235\">McGilligan (1999), p.235</ref> As with many of his films, Eastwood was intent on shooting it as smoothly as possible, often refusing to do retakes over certain scenes.  Post later remarked: \"A lot of the things he said were based on pure, selfish ignorance, and showed that he was the man who controlled the power. By ''Magnum Force'', Clint's ego began applying for statehood\".<ref name=\"McGilligan235\" /> Post remained bitter with Eastwood for many years and claims disagreements over the filming affected his career afterwards.<ref name=\"McGilligan236\">McGilligan (1999), p.236</ref> According to second unit director of photography Rexford Metz, \"Eastwood would not take the time to perfect a situation. If you've got 70% of a shot worked out, that's sufficient for him, because he knows his audience will accept it.\"<ref name=\"McGilligan235\" />\n== Music ==\n* Orchestra [[arrangement|arranged]] and [[conducting|conducted]] by [[Lalo Schifrin]] including<ref>{{cite web |title=Magnum Force |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/jots.200017440 |website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n** [[Bud Shank]] - [[Reed (mouthpiece)|reeds]]\n** [[Carol Kaye]] - [[electric bass]]\n** [[Howard Roberts]], [[Dennis Budimir]], [[Tommy Tedesco]] - [[guitar]]\n** [[Max Bennett (musician)|Max Bennett]] - [[double bass]]\n** [[Emil Richards]] - [[percussion]]\n\n== Controversy ==\nThe film received negative publicity in 1974 when it was discovered that the scene where the prostitute is killed with [[drain cleaner]] had allegedly inspired the infamous [[Hi-Fi murders]], with the two killers believing the method would be as efficient as it was portrayed in the film. The killers said that they were looking for a unique murder method when they stumbled upon the film, and had they not seen the movie, would have chosen a method from another film. The drain cleaner reference was repeated in at least two other films, including ''[[Heathers]]'' (1988) and ''[[Urban Legend (film)|Urban Legend]]'' (1998).\nAccording to scriptwriter John Milius, this drain cleaner scene was never meant to be filmed, but was only mentioned in his original script.<ref name=\"commentary\" />\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== Box office ===\nIn the film's opening week, it grossed $6,871,011 from 401 theatres.<ref>Munn, p. 142</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 9, 1974|title=Magnum Force \u2013 Warner Bros.

Part IV, p. 29.</ref> [[Pauline Kael]], a harsh critic of Eastwood's for many years, mocked his performance as Dirty Harry, commenting, \"He isn't an actor, so one could hardly call him a bad actor. He'd have to do something before we could consider him bad at it. And acting isn't required of him in ''Magnum Force''.\"<ref name=\"McGilligan236\" /> Gary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' was positive, praising the film as \"an ingenious and exciting crime thriller\" with \"a less self-righteous message\" than the original ''Dirty Harry''.<ref>Arnold, Gary (January 1, 1974). \"Magnum Force\".

Sure, Harry may be a little trigger-happy, but at least he shoots the right people. The problem, however, one which the film raises but never resolves, is who determines the definition of 'right' people?\"<ref>Crowdus, Gary (1974). \"Magnum Force\".
