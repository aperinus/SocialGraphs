As the story progresses, Pepe is faced with frustrating consequences, with him facing pressure from his sponsors and the wedding of his former girlfriend, Carmen, to his elder brother, \u00c1ngel, coinciding on the same day of the penultimate stage of the bicycle race. Originally is meant to be a backup racer (domestique) whose job is to assist his more prominent teammate to win the race. However he accidentally overhears a conversation in his sponsor's van through his radio com-link which had been negligently left open, in which he finds out, to his shock, that his sponsor intends to fire him after the race. Realizing that he may not find another team for the next season and that he has nothing left to lose, he disregards his instructions and sets out to win the race for himself.\n\n==Influences==\nSome of the teams or riders in the race are influenced by name and/or uniform by actual cycling teams or riders in the early 2000s.

Bazel's team P-Phone, and its sprint train strategy, is comparable to that of the [[HTC-Highroad|Telekom]] team of [[Erik Zabel]], who Bazel is named after. Zabel was one of the most prominent sprinters of all time, winning many stages in the Grand Tours.\n\n==Credits==\n''Nasu: Summer in Andalusia'' was produced by the anime studio, Madhouse, and directed and written by Kitar\u014d K\u014dsaka, the famed animation supervisor of the Oscar-winning anime film, ''Spirited Away'' and ''Princess Mononoke'', and long-time collaborator of Studio Ghibli, and was his theatrical film directorial debut.
