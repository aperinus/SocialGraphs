It is the [[remake]] of the [[Walking Tall (1973 film)|1973 film of the same name]], and stars [[Dwayne Johnson]] (credited as The Rock) and [[Johnny Knoxville]]. The film revolves around a discharged [[United States Army Special Forces|U.S Army soldier]], who returns to his hometown only to become the town's [[Sheriff|sheriff]], when he finds that the town is laced with heinous crimes and corruption.\n\n==Plot==\nHonorably discharged [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Army Special Forces]] Sergeant Chris Vaughn returns to his small home town in [[Kitsap County, Washington]] after a series of combat deployments. Looking for work, he finds the local cedar mill was closed down three years prior by its heir, Jay Hamilton, who opened a new casino that now accounts for the majority of revenue for the local area. Hamilton, who was also Chris' school friend, invites him to a night of fun at the casino. While checking out the VIP lounge, Chris stumbles upon his childhood friend Deni, who is now working as a stripper. Later, he notices the craps dealer using loaded dice and demonstrates this to the patrons by placing a bet and calling out the roll before throwing the dice. When the floorman declares no payout, Chris instigates a fight. Although he beats down most of the security guards, he is subsequently subdued with a cattle prod and knocked unconscious. The security staff take Chris into the basement and Hamilton's right-hand man and head of security, Booth, tortures him by cutting his torso with a utility knife before dumping him on a roadside.\n\nChris is found by a trucker and hospitalized, but recovers quickly. Chris goes to the sheriff, Stan Watkins, to press charges against the guards, but Sheriff Watkins refuses to allow him to do so, stating that because of its position, the casino is considered a \"no fly zone\". Not long after this, Chris learns that his nephew, Pete, experimented with [[methamphetamine|crystal meth]], which was sold to his friends by the casino security guards. Infuriated, Chris arrives at the casino and, using a piece of lumber as a club, begins destroying casino property and brutally beats the security guards when they attempt to stop him. Chris is apprehended by Sheriff Watkins and his deputies as he is driving away from the scene.  \n\nIn the ensuing trial, all of Hamilton's security and staff testify against Chris. When the judge allows Chris to present his defense, he fires his appointed attorney, who is implicitly under Hamilton's employ. After making a civic speech about the town's great former self, Chris tells the jury and the rest of the town that if he is cleared of the charges, he will run for sheriff and clean up the town. To further emphasize his plea, Chris reveals the grotesque scars he received from the attack. He is then acquitted and eventually wins the election. \n\nUpon taking office, Chris summarily dismisses the entire police force and deputizes his friend, Ray Templeton, whom Chris feels he can trust, as well as help Chris learn about [[narcotics]] (Ray revealed earlier that he served time in prison after becoming a drug addict). Chris and Ray crack down on a supply spot where they search Booth and take him into custody. In an attempt to make him reveal information on the town drug operation, they hold him captive in a garage and proceed to strip his truck into pieces in front of him, but he does not talk. Chris assigns Ray to stand watch over his house, as he knows Hamilton will likely target his family. Chris himself remains at the sheriff's office to supervise Booth. He is visited by Deni, stopping by under the pretense of bringing him food and reveals that she quit her job as the casino stripper.  \n\nThe next morning, Watkins and his deputies arrive at the Chris' office where they blow up his truck and fire upon the building with machine guns. Recognizing his dangerous predicament, Booth pleads for Chris to let him out of his cell, prompting Chris to use Booth's perilous situation as leverage for information. Booth reveals that the cedar mill is where the drugs are being produced, but is immediately killed by the indiscriminate fire of the attackers. Chris manages to kill all of the attackers with Deni's help. Chris' parents' house is attacked, but Ray and Chris' father are able to dispatch the gunmen.  \n\nAfter ensuring their safety, Chris heads for the mill where he discovers a meth lab as well as Hamilton, calmly waiting in a control room. Hamilton attempts to kill Chris with the mill equipment by dropping him through a trap door, but Chris drags Hamilton down with him and the two fall through a chute. Chris, whose leg is injured, manages to tend to his injury in a nearby forest before Hamilton attacks him with an axe. The two fight for their lives, with Chris coming out on top by crippling Hamilton, who is then arrested and taken into custody. With Ray's assistance, Chris shuts down the casino and reopens the cedar mill. \n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] (credited as The Rock) as Chris Vaughn Jr, an Army veteran who runs for sheriff in an effort to clean up his hometown\n** Both the character and the story is based off of Sheriff [[Buford Pusser]] and his time as sheriff of [[McNairy County, Tennessee]].
