The storyline was suggested by the bestselling 1953 non-fiction book ''[[Flying Saucers from Outer Space]]'' by Maj. [[Donald Keyhoe]].<ref name=\"Jacobs\">Jacobs [https://books.google.com/books?id=tkqW7YxEH1oC&pg=PA11 2008, pp. 11\u201316].</ref> The film was released as a [[double feature]] with ''[[The Werewolf (1956 film)|The Werewolf]]''.<ref>McGee, Mark Thomas; Robertson, R.J.

With no proof of the encounter other than a tape recording of the ship's sound, Dr. Marvin is hesitant to notify his superiors. He is in charge of Project Skyhook, an American space program that has already launched ten research satellites into orbit. General Hanley, Carol's father, informs Marvin that many of the satellites have since fallen back to Earth. Marvin admits that he has lost contact with all of them and privately suspects [[extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]] involvement. The Marvins then witness the 11th falling from the sky shortly after launch.\n\nWhen a saucer lands at Skyhook the next day, a group of aliens in metallic suits exit, and the infantry guards open fire, killing one alien, while others and the saucer are protected by a [[force field (technology)|force field]]. The aliens proceed to kill everyone at the facility but the Marvins; General Hanley is captured and taken away in the saucer. Too late, Russell discovers and decodes a message on his tape recorder: the aliens wanted to meet with Dr. Marvin and landed in peace at Skyhook for that purpose but they were instead met with violence.\n\nMarvin contacts the aliens by radio and sneaks away to meet them, followed closely by Carol and Major Huglin. They and a pursuing motorcycle patrol officer are taken aboard a saucer, where the aliens extract knowledge directly from the general's brain. The aliens explain that they are the last of their species, having fled from their destroyed solar system. They are extremely aged and are kept alive only by their protective garments. They have shot down all the launched satellites, fearing them as weapons. As proof of their power, the aliens give Dr. Marvin the coordinates of a naval destroyer that opened fire on them, and which they have since destroyed. Horrified by the cold, unempathic nature of the aliens, Carol begins to break down, and the patrol officer, despite an attempt by Marvin to stop him, pulls his revolver and fires on the aliens; the aliens subject him to the same mind control process as General Hanley. The aliens state that they will eventually return Hanley and the patrol officer. As the interaction continues, Carol becomes increasingly irrational, while Marvin tries to remain calm. Major Huglin and the Marvins are released with the message that the aliens want to meet with the world's leaders in 56 days in [[Washington, D.C.]] to negotiate an occupation of Earth.\n\nDr. Marvin's later observations lead to the discovery that the aliens' protective suits are made of solidified electricity and grant them enhanced [[hearing|auditory perception]]. Marvin develops a counter-weapon against their flying saucers, which he later successfully tests against a single saucer. As they escape, the aliens jettison Hanley and the patrol officer, who fall to their deaths. Groups of alien saucers then attack Washington, [[Paris]], [[London]], and [[Moscow]], and resistance by conventional weapons is futile. But they are destroyed by Dr. Marvin's sonic weapon. The defenders also discover that the aliens can be easily killed by [[small arms]] gunfire when they are outside the force fields of their saucers. Upon repelling the attack and no further threats anticipated, Project Skyhook is reestablished with Dr. Marvin once again placed in charge.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hugh Marlowe]] as Dr. Russell A.
