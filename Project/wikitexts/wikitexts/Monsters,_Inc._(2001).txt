The film centers on two monsters, the hairy James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan and his one-eyed partner and best friend [[Mike Wazowski]], who are employed at the titular energy-producing factory ''Monsters, Inc.'', which generates power by scaring human children. However, the monster world believes that the children are toxic, and when a little human girl sneaks into the factory, she must be returned home before it is too late.\n\nDocter began developing the film in 1996, and wrote the story with [[Jill Culton]], [[Jeff Pidgeon]] and [[Ralph Eggleston]]. Stanton wrote the screenplay with screenwriter [[Daniel Gerson]]. The characters went through many incarnations over the film's five-year production process. The technical team and animators found new ways to simulate fur and cloth realistically for the film. [[Randy Newman]], who composed the music for Pixar's three prior films, returned to compose the score for its fourth.\n\nPremiering at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on October 28, ''Monsters, Inc.'' was released in theaters in the United States on November 2, 2001.

Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\nIn a world inhabited by [[monster]]s, the city of Monstropolis harnesses the screams of [[human]] children for energy. At the Monsters, Incorporated factory, skilled monsters employed as \"scarers\" venture into the human world to scare children and harvest their screams, through doors that activate portals to children's bedroom closets. The work is considered dangerous, as human children are believed to be toxic and capable of killing a monster through physical contact. Energy production is declining because children are becoming less easily scared, and the company's CEO, [[Henry J. Waternoose III]], is determined to prevent the company's collapse.\n\nOne evening after work, top-ranking scarer [[James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan]] discovers that an active door has been left in the station of his rival, [[Randall Boggs]]. He inspects the door and accidentally lets a small toddler girl into the factory. Frightened, Sulley unsuccessfully attempts to return the girl, who escapes into Monstropolis, interrupting Sulley's best friend and assistant [[Mike Wazowski]] on a date at a sushi restaurant. Chaos erupts when other monsters see the girl; Sulley and Mike manage to escape with her before the Child Detection Agency (CDA) arrives and quarantines the restaurant. Forced to keep the girl hidden in their apartment for the night, Sulley soon realizes that the girl is not toxic and her laughter is able to generate more energy than screams.\n\nThe next day, Sulley and Mike disguise the girl as a monster and attempt to send her home. While Mike seeks out her door, Sulley grows attached to her and nicknames her \"Boo\". Randall, waiting in ambush for the girl, kidnaps Mike by accident and reveals his plan to revolutionize scaring: He will kidnap children and extract screams from them using a device he invented, the Scream Extractor. Sulley rescues Mike, and they search for Waternoose to alert him of Randall's plan. Boo shows herself to Waternoose, who reveals that he is working with Randall. Waternoose kidnaps Boo and uses a door to exile Mike and Sulley to [[Himalayas|the Himalayas]]. \n\nSulley finds a way to return to the Monster world, but Mike refuses to go with him, blaming Sulley for their situation. Sulley returns to the factory alone and saves Boo from the Scream Extractor, but Randall tries to kill him. Mike returns to reconcile with Sulley, and both search for Boo's door. Randall eventually catches up to them, but Boo attacks him, enabling Sulley and Mike to hurl Randall through a door, which they then destroy. Randall is then beaten with a shovel by two people living in a trailer in the human world.\n\nWhen Mike and Sulley locate Boo's door, Waternoose, accompanied by the CDA, brings it down to the scare floor with the intent of arresting Mike and Sulley. Mike distracts the CDA while Sulley and Boo escape, leading Waternoose into a scare simulation room. There, Sulley tricks Waternoose into revealing his conspiracy with Randall to kidnap thousands of children. Mike records the conversation, exposing him to the CDA, and Waternoose is arrested. Undercover CDA agent Roz allows Sulley to send Boo home, but has her door demolished. Sulley concocts a plan to retool the company's power generation method to harvest children's laughter instead of screams, as laughter is ten times more powerful. With the energy crisis solved, the factory is now focused on making children laugh to collect energy; Mike becomes the company's top comedian and Sulley is named the new CEO. A month later, Mike reveals to Sulley he has rebuilt Boo's door. Sulley enters the door and reunites with Boo.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of Monsters, Inc. characters}}\n* [[John Goodman]] as Sullivan, a huge, furry blue [[bear]]-like monster with horns, a tail, and purple spots.

So when Disney asked us to do some more films, I wanted to tap into a childlike notion that was similar to that. I knew monsters were coming out of my closet when I was a kid. So I said, 'Hey, let's do a film about monsters.{{'\"}}<ref name=\"Monsters Inc, 2002 DVD, commentary\">''Monsters Inc.'', 2002 DVD, commentary</ref>\n\nDocter began work on the film that was to become ''Monsters, Inc.'' in 1996 while others focused on ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' (1998) and ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' (1999). Its code name was ''Hidden City'', named for Docter's favorite restaurant in [[Point Richmond, Richmond, California|Point Richmond]].<ref name=\"PixarTouch195\">Price, p. 195</ref> By early-February 1997, Docter had drafted a treatment together with [[Harley Jessup]], [[Jill Culton]], and [[Jeff Pidgeon]] that bore some resemblance to the final film. Docter pitched the story to Disney with some initial artwork on February 4 that year. He and his story team left with some suggestions in hand and returned to pitch a refined version of the story on May 30. At this pitch meeting, longtime Disney animator [[Joe Grant]]&nbsp;\u2013 whose work stretched back to ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 suggested the title ''Monsters, Inc.'', a play on the title of a gangster film ''[[Murder, Inc.

Sulley's eventual sidekick, Mike Wazowski, had not yet been added.<ref name = \"CultureProductionNotes\"/><ref name=\"PixarTouch196\">Price, p. 196</ref>\n\nBetween 1996 and 2000, the lead monster and child went through radical changes as the story evolved. As the story continued to develop, the child varied in age and gender. Ultimately, the story team decided that a girl would be the best counterpart for a furry, {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} co-star.<ref name = \"CultureProductionNotes\"/> After a girl was settled upon, the character continued to undergo changes, at one point being from Ireland and at another time being an African-American character.<ref name=\"PixarTouch197\"/> Originally, the character of the little girl, known as Mary, became a fearless seven-year-old who has been toughened by years of teasing and pranks from four older brothers.<ref name=\"PixarTouch197\"/> In stark contrast, Johnson is nervous about the possibility of losing his job after the boss at Monsters, Inc. announces a downsizing is on the way. He feels envious because another scarer, Ned (who later became Randall), is the company's top performer.<ref name=\"PixarTouch197\"/> Through various drafts, Johnson's occupation went back-and-forth from being a scarer and from working in another area of the company such as a janitor or a refinery worker, until his final incarnation as the best scarer at Monsters, Inc.<ref name=\"PixarTouch197\"/> Throughout development, Pixar worried that having a main character whose main goal was to scare children would alienate audiences and make them not empathize with him. Docter would later describe that the team \"bent over backwards trying to create a story that still had monsters\" while still attempting to solve the problem.<ref name=\"Entertainment15\"/> A key moment came when the team decided \"Okay, he's the BEST scarer there. He's the star quarterback\" with Docter noting that before that moment \"design after design, we really didn't know what he was about.\"<ref name=\"Entertainment15\"/> Disney noted to Pixar early on that they did not want the character to \"look like a guy in a suit\".<ref name=\"Entertainment15\"/> To this end, Johnson was originally planned to have tentacles for feet; however, this caused many problems in early animation tests. The idea was later largely rejected, as it was thought that audiences would be distracted by the tentacles.<ref name = \"EarlyTests\">Early Tests. Commentary by [[Thomas Porter (Pixar)|Thomas Porter]], Steve May and Michael Fong, ''Monsters Inc''. 2002 DVD.</ref> Mary's age also differed from draft to draft until the writers settled on the age of 3. \"We found that the younger she was, the more dependent she was on Sulley\", Docter said.<ref name=\"Monsters Inc, 2002 DVD, commentary\"/>\n\nEventually, Johnson was renamed Sullivan. Sullivan was also planned to wear glasses throughout the film. However, the creators found it a dangerous idea because the eyes were a perfectly readable and clear way of expressing a character's personality; thus, this idea was also rejected.<ref name = \"EarlyTests\"/>\n\nThe idea of a monster buddy for the lead monster emerged at an April 6, 1998 \"story summit\" in Burbank with employees from Disney and Pixar. A term coined by Lasseter, a \"story summit\" was a crash exercise that would yield a finished story in only two days.<ref name=\"PixarTouch180\">Price, p. 180</ref> Such a character, the group agreed, would give the lead monster someone to talk to about his predicament. Development artist Ricky Nierva drew a concept sketch of a rounded, one-eyed monster as a concept for the character, and everyone was generally receptive to it.<ref name=\"Monsters Inc, 2002 DVD, commentary\"/> Docter named the character Mike for the father of his friend [[Frank Oz]], a director and [[The Muppets|Muppet]] performer.<ref name=\"PixarTouch197\"/> [[Jeff Pidgeon]] and Jason Katz story-boarded a test in which Mike helps Sulley choose a tie for work, and Mike Wazowski soon became a vital character in the film.<ref name=\"Monsters Inc, 2002 DVD, commentary\"/> Originally, Mike had no arms and had to use his legs as appendages; however, due to some technical difficulties, arms were soon added to him.<ref name=\"Monsters Inc, 2002 DVD, commentary\"/>\n\nScreenwriter [[Daniel Gerson]] joined Pixar in 1999 and worked on the film with the filmmakers on a daily basis for almost two years. He considered it his first experience in writing a feature film. He explained, \"I would sit with Pete [Docter] and [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]] and we would talk about a scene and they would tell me what they were looking for. I would make some suggestions and then go off and write the sequence. We'd get together again and review it and then hand it off to a story artist. Here's where the collaborative process really kicked in. The board artist was not beholden to my work and could take liberties here and there. Sometimes, I would suggest an idea about making the joke work better visually.

The company moved from Point Richmond to a much bigger campus in [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], co-designed by Lasseter and [[Steve Jobs]].<ref name=\"PixarTouch198\"/>\n\nIn production, the film differed from earlier Pixar features, as every main character in this movie had its own lead animator \u2013 [[John Kahrs]] on Sulley, Andrew Gordon on Mike, and Dave DeVan on Boo.<ref name=\"PixarTouch199\">Price, p. 199</ref> Kahrs found that the \"bearlike quality\" of Goodman's voice provided an exceptionally good fit with the character. He faced a difficult challenge, however, in dealing with Sulley's sheer mass; traditionally, animators conveyed a figure's heaviness by giving it a slower, more belabored movement, but Kahrs was concerned that such an approach to a central character would give the film a \"sluggish\" feel.<ref name=\"PixarTouch199\"/> Like Goodman, Kahrs came to think of Sulley as a football player, one whose athleticism enabled him to move quickly in spite of his size. To help the animators with Sulley and other large monsters, Pixar arranged for Rodger Kram, a [[University of California, Berkeley]] expert on the locomotion of heavy mammals, to lecture on the subject.<ref name=\"PixarTouch199\"/>\n\nAdding to Sulley's lifelike appearance was an intense effort by the technical team to refine the rendering of fur. Other production houses had tackled realistic fur, most notably [[Rhythm & Hues]] in its 1993 [[polar bear]] commercials for [[Coca-Cola]] and in its talking animals' faces in the 1995 film ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch199\"/> This film, however, required fur on a much larger scale. From the standpoint of Pixar's engineers, the quest for fur posed several significant challenges; one was to figure out how to animate a large number of hairs \u2013 2,320,413 of them on Sulley \u2013 in a reasonably efficient way,<ref name=\"PixarTouch199\"/> and another was to make sure that the hairs cast shadows on other ones. Without [[self-shadowing]], either fur or hair takes on an unrealistic flat-colored look (e.g., in ''Toy Story'', the hair on Andy's toddler sister, as seen in that movie's opening sequence, is hair without self-shadowing).<ref name=\"PixarTouch199\"/>\n\nThe first fur test allowed Sulley to run an [[obstacle course]]. Results were not satisfactory, as such objects caught and stretched out the fur due to the extreme amount of motion. Another similar test was also unsuccessful, because, this time, the fur went ''through'' the objects.<ref name = \"EarlyTests\"/>\n\nPixar then set up a Simulation department and created a new fur simulation program called '''Fizt''' (short for \"physics tool\").<ref name=\"PixarTouch200\"/> After a shot with Sulley in it had been animated, this department took the data for that shot and added Sulley's fur. Fizt allowed the fur to react in a more natural way. Every time when Sulley had to move, his fur (automatically) reacted to his movements, thus taking the effects of wind and gravity into account as well. The Fizt program also controlled the movement of Boo's clothes, which provided another \"breakthrough\".<ref name=\"PixarTouch200\">Price, p. 200</ref> The deceptively simple-sounding task of animating cloth was also a challenge to animate thanks to those hundreds of creases and wrinkles that automatically occurred in the clothing when the wearer moved.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">2002, Monsters Inc, DVD-Behind the Scenes</ref> Also, this meant they had to solve the complex problem of how to keep cloth untangled \u2013 in other words, to keep it from passing through itself when parts of it intersect.<ref name=\"PixarTouch201\">Price, p. 201</ref> Fizt applied the same system to Boo's clothes as to Sulley's fur. First of all, Boo was animated shirtless; the Simulation department then used Fizt to apply the shirt over Boo's body, and every time she moved, her clothes also reacted to her movements in a more natural manner.\n\nTo solve the problem of cloth-to-cloth collisions, Michael Kass, Pixar's senior scientist, was joined on ''Monsters, Inc.'' by David Baraff and Andrew Witkin and developed an [[algorithm]] they called \"global intersection analysis\" to handle the problem. The complexity of the shots in the film, including elaborate sets such as the door vault, required more computing power to render than any of Pixar's earlier efforts combined. The [[render farm]] in place for ''Monsters, Inc.'' was made up of 3500 [[Sun Microsystems]] processors, compared with 1400 for ''Toy Story 2'' and only 200 for ''Toy Story'', both built on Sun's own RISC-based [[SPARC processor architecture]].<ref name=\"PixarTouch201\"/>\n\nThe scene in which the Harryhausen's restaurant was decontaminated was originally going to feature the restaurant being blown up.
