It was shown in 1983 at the [[London Film Festival]] and on Channel 4 and at the 1984 [[Berlin International Film Festival]]. According to the critic [[Michael Coveney]], \"the sapping, debilitating and demeaning state of unemployment, the futile sense of waste, has not been more poignantly, or poetically, expressed in any other film of the period.\"<ref>Michael Coveney, The World according to Mike Leigh, p.174</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film unfolds in brief episodes, detailing the travails of the working-class Pollock family, who live in a shabby flat in a [[tower block]] in [[London]]'s [[East End]]. They are struggling to stay afloat during the [[recession]] under Prime Minister [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher's premiership]]. Only the nagging, put-upon mother Mavis ([[Pam Ferris]]) is working; the bitter, feckless father Frank (Jeff Robert) and the couple's two sons Colin ([[Tim Roth]]), an extremely shy young man, and Mark ([[Phil Daniels]]), his outspoken, headstrong older brother, are on the [[Jobseeker's Allowance|dole]]. Their aimless, querulous existence is contrasted with Mavis's sister Barbara ([[Marion Bailey]]) and her husband John ([[Alfred Molina]]), whose financial and social loftiness in suburban [[Chigwell]] serves as a comfortable facade for their lacklustre marriage.\n\nThe boys spend their time at home, on the street, at friends' flats, in the unemployment office, and at the local pub. Mark is continually scrounging for cash and cadging drinks from his friends, among them Coxy ([[Gary Oldman]] in his screen debut), a crude, impulsive skinhead. Colin has a crush on a sweet-natured girl named Hayley ([[Tilly Vosburgh]]), but he can't bring himself to act upon it. Mark mocks his father, teases Colin by calling him \"Kermit\" and \"Muppet,\" and makes insinuations about Barbara's troubled relationship with her husband. Barbara offers Colin a job helping her redecorate her home, but when Mark shows up, Colin withdraws, refuses to do any work, and finally leaves. When he returns home, he's had his head shaved. There is no resolution to the film, simply a succession of days that present commonplace problems, amusements, conversations, and arguments.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Marion Bailey]] as Barbara\n*[[Phil Daniels]] as Mark \n*[[Tim Roth]] as Colin\n*[[Pam Ferris]] as Mavis\n*Jeffrey Robert as Frank \n*[[Alfred Molina]] as John \n*[[Gary Oldman]] as Coxy\n*[[Tilly Vosburgh]] as Hayley\n*Paul Daly as Rusty\n*Leila Bertrand as Hayley's Friend\n*Hepburn Graham as Boyfriend\n*[[Peter Wight (actor)|Peter Wight]] as Estate Manager\n*[[Eileen Davies]] as Unemployment Benefit Clerk\n*[[Herbert Norville]] as Man in Pub\n*Brian Hoskin as Barman\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Filming locations==\n* Bryant Court (Pollock family flat), Whiston Road, [[London]] [[E postcode area|E2]]\n* Dunston Road (canal scene), [[London]] [[E postcode area|E2]]\n* 10 Gwynne Park Avenue (Barbara and John's house), [[Woodford Bridge]], [[London]] IG8 8AB\n* [[Trafalgar Square]], London\n* [[Chigwell]], north-east London\n* [[Woodford Green]], north-east London\n\n==Notes==\nOne day at the rehearsal space, a factory in [[Homerton]], Roth and Oldman were throwing a milk bottle around. Suddenly Roth threw it up and it hit a fluorescent lighting strip. Leigh saw \"Gary's shaven head erupt into a thousand red blotches; in the film you can see the stitch marks.\" He rushed Oldman to hospital. \"As I drove him there, all done up in his skinhead stuff, covered in blood, Gary said to me, 'For fuck's sake, tell 'em I'm an actor!' He could easily have lost his eyesight in the accident, and I do not know to this day what I would have done if that had happened.\"<ref>Coveney, p.176</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0082727}}\n*[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/515998/index.html ''Meantime''] at [[BFI Screenonline]]\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/4842-meantime-margins-and-centers ''Meantime: Margins and Centers''] an essay by Sean O\u2019Sullivan at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Mike Leigh}}\n\n[[Category:1976 plays]]\n[[Category:Plays by Mike Leigh]]\n[[Category:1983 television films]]\n[[Category:1983 films]]\n[[Category:British comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1983 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mike Leigh]]\n[[Category:Social realism in film]]\n[[Category:Skinhead films]]\n[[Category:1980s gang films]]\n[[Category:1983 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1983 drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s British films]]\n[[Category:British drama television films]]"}]}}}}
