It is based on the 1976 [[Autobiography|semi-autobiographical]] novella ''[[A River Runs Through It (novel)|A River Runs Through It]]'' by [[Norman Maclean]], adapted for the screen by [[Richard Friedenberg]]. Set in and around [[Missoula, Montana]], the story follows two sons of a [[Presbyterian]] minister, one studious and the other rebellious, as they grow up and come of age in the Rocky Mountain region during a span of time from roughly [[World War I]] to the early days of the [[Great Depression]], including part of the [[Prohibition era]].<ref name=wapotbth>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/ariverrunsthroughitpgthompson_a09e82.htm|newspaper=Washington Post|last=Thompson|first=Toby |title=A River Runs Through It |date=October 11, 1992|access-date=April 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe film won the [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]] and was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music, Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. The film grossed over $66 million and received positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=October 2022}}<!--- [[WP:PLOTBLOAT|bloated 900-word \"synopsis\"]] versus 400-700 word norm --->\nThe Maclean brothers, Norman and Paul, grow up in [[Missoula, Montana]], with their mother, Clara, and their father, Rev. [[John Norman Maclean (minister)|John Maclean]], a [[Presbyterian minister]], from whom they learn a love of [[fly fishing]] for trout in the [[Blackfoot River (Montana)|Blackfoot River]]. Norman and Paul are [[homeschooling|home schooled]] under the strict moral and academic code of their father. As young men, the brothers steal a rowboat and navigate a dangerous waterfall. Norman leaves to attend college at [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]]. When he returns six years later during the [[Prohibition era]] and the [[Jazz Age]], he finds that Paul has become a highly skilled fisherman and a hard drinking but fearless [[investigative journalist]] working for a newspaper in [[Helena, Montana|Helena]].\n\nNorman attends a [[Fourth of July]] dance and meets Jessie Burns, a [[flapper]] whose father runs the [[general store]] in [[Wolf Creek, Montana|Wolf Creek]]. Immediately smitten, Norman calls Jessie the next morning and sets up a [[double date]]. Norman and Jessie go on their first date at the Hot Springs [[speakeasy]]. Paul arrives with his date, a similarly hard drinking [[Cheyenne people|Cheyenne]] woman named Mabel, who is deemed inferior by the local white crowd.\n\nSoon after, Norman is called to come bail Paul out of jail after Paul is arrested for hitting a man who insulted Mabel. The Desk Sergeant tells Norman that Paul has angered local criminals by falling behind in his debts from a big poker game at the Lolo speakeasy. A terrified Norman offers to give Paul money if he needs it, but Paul brushes him off.\n\nAfter Norman and Jessie go on several dates, she asks him to try to help her [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] brother Neal, who is visiting from [[Southern California]]. Norman and Paul dislike Neal, but at Jessie's insistence they invite him to go [[fly fishing]]. Neal shows up drunk with Rawhide, a [[prostitute]] whom he met at the only [[speakeasy]] in Wolf Creek the night before. Norman and Paul get separated from Neal but fly fish anyway and return to their car hours later to find that Neal and Rawhide have stolen and drunk all the beer, had sex, and passed out naked in the sun.\n \nA humiliated Norman drives an intoxicated and painfully [[sunburn]]ed Neal home, where Jessie is enraged that the brothers left Neal alone with the beer instead of fishing with him. Norman asks Jessie to take him home as he had brought Neal back in Neal's car, and he tells her that he is falling in love with her. Jessie drives away angry but a week later asks Norman to come to the train station to see Neal off. After the train departs, Jessie laments her failure to save Neal from his [[alcoholism]] and asks in tears why the people who need help the most will not accept it. After saying that he does not know why, Norman shows Jessie a letter from the [[University of Chicago]] offering him a faculty position in the Department of [[English Literature]]. Norman tells Jessie that he does not wish to leave Montana and when it becomes clear that it is because of her, her face lights up and she embraces him.\n\nThat night, a drunken Norman meets up with Paul and announces his love for Jessie. Paul says they should go celebrate but instead he takes Norman to the Lolo speakeasy and tells Norman that he could use some of his luck. Paul tries to get in on the poker game in the backroom but the dealer will not let him play because he already owes so much. When Paul presses the issue, a scuffle ensues. Paul and Norman go back to their car but Paul tells Norman that he isn't leaving since he is feeling lucky and that he will convince the others to let him play. Norman reluctantly drives off after Paul asks him to go fishing the next day.\n\n[[File:Blackfoot.jpg|thumb|[[Blackfoot River (Montana)|Blackfoot River]]|alt=]]\nNorman is relieved when Paul arrives the following morning as he feared for his brother's life. Norman tells his family that he is going to accept the job in Chicago. Norman, Paul, and their father go fly fishing one last time. Norman urges his brother to come with him and Jessie to [[Chicago]]. Paul grins and says he will never leave Montana. Paul hooks a huge [[rainbow trout]] that drags him down the river rapids before he finally lands it. Their father proudly tells Paul that he has become a wonderful fisherman and an artist in the craft, much to Paul's delight. They pose for pictures with the fish.\n\nJust before Norman leaves for Chicago, police inform Norman that Paul was beaten to death and dumped in an alley. Norman goes home and breaks the news to his parents. Years later, Mrs. Maclean, Norman, Jessie, and their two children listen to a sermon being given by Rev. Maclean, soon before his own death. Visibly heartbroken, Rev. Maclean preaches about being unable to help loved ones who are destroying themselves and who will not accept help. All that those who truly care for such a self-destructive person can do, Rev. Maclean concludes, is to give [[unconditional love]], even without understanding the reasons why.\n\nThe closing scene shows an elderly [[Norman Maclean]] fishing on the same river, as director [[Robert Redford]] narrates the final lines from his original [[novella]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per opening stand-alone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Craig Sheffer]] as [[Norman Maclean]]\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Paul Maclean\n* [[Tom Skerritt]] as Reverend Maclean\n* [[Brenda Blethyn]] as Mrs. Maclean\n* [[Emily Lloyd]] as Jessie Burns\n* [[Edie McClurg]] as Mrs. Burns\n* [[Stephen Shellen]] as Neal Burns\n}}\n\nIn addition, [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] and Van Gravage portray the childhood versions of Norman and Paul, respectively, while director [[Robert Redford]] provides the uncredited narration, in the first person voice of a [[Old age|senior]] Norman.\n\n==Production==\n===Filming===\n[[Image:Redeemer Lutheran Church (Livingston, Montana)2.JPG|thumb|The Redeemer Lutheran Church in Livingston, Montana, used for the Presbyterian church scenes.]]\nAlthough both the book and movie are set in Missoula and on the Blackfoot River, it was filmed in late June to early July 1991 in south central Montana in [[Livingston, Montana|Livingston]] and [[Bozeman, Montana|Bozeman]],<ref name=wapotbth/> <!--[[Great Falls, Montana|Great Falls]],<ref>See Wikipedia article Great Falls, Montana (section Motion pictures filmed in Great Falls).
