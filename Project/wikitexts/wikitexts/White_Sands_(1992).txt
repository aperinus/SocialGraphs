Jackson]], and [[Mickey Rourke]]. Written by Daniel Pyne for [[Warner Bros.]], the film is about a U.S. southwestern small-town [[sheriff]] who finds a body in the desert with a suitcase and $500,000. He impersonates the man and stumbles into an [[FBI]] investigation.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plots should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nRay Dolezal, a bored [[Torrance County, New Mexico]] [[Deputy Sheriff]], investigates an apparent suicide in the desert. Alongside the body of Bob Spencer is a suitcase containing $500,000.  During the autopsy, they find a digested piece of paper with a phone number; Dolezal, posing as Spencer, calls the number and goes to a meeting, where he is robbed and instructed to meet Gorman Lennox at a restaurant. [[FBI]] agent Greg Meeker intercepts Dolezal and informs him that Spencer was an undercover agent. Now that Dolezal has lost the money, Meeker suggests he continue posing as Spencer to recover the money or help arrest Lennox.\n\nDolezal meets Lennox and his wealthy associate Lane Bodine and learns the money is to arm left-wing freedom fighters in South America.  The arms dealers demo the guns for Dolezal and Lennox but demand an additional $250,000 due to unforeseen expenses.  Meeker pushes the responsibility on Dolezal, who romances his way into Lane's life so she will attract rich humanitarian donors to fund the deal. Two FBI internal affairs agents suspect Dolezal of killing Spencer and stealing the money. Dolezal is forced to admit to Lane he is not really Spencer, but she agrees to help raise the money because she finds Dolezal a better alternative to the volatile Lennox.\n\nDolezal learns from Noreen, who had an affair with the real Spencer, that he was working with an FBI agent who likely killed him. Noreen runs away at the sight of Meeker, and the internal affairs agents grab Dolezal.  Lennox runs the agents off the road; Dolezal flees and returns to Lane.  He discovers Noreen shot dead and a Polaroid of her with Spencer and Meeker.\n\nDolezal breaks into a surveillance van outside Lane's house and beats up the FBI agent.  He accuses Meeker of killing Spencer and Noreen.  Meeker admits he took the $500,000 without authorization to steal it and capture Lennox at the same time, but Spencer lost his nerve and wanted out.  Meeker confronted him out in the desert and convinced him to shoot himself.  He tells Dolezal the Polaroid proves nothing, and no one will believe his word against that of a minority agent with a spotless record.\n\nLennox meets Dolezal and reveals the two internal affairs agents tied up in the trunk of his car.  They drive into the desert, where Lennox says he knows Dolezal is not Spencer, because Lennox is really a [[CIA]] agent who wants the arms deal to go through, ensuring the survival of the [[military\u2013industrial complex]].  Lennox kills the two agents and informs Dolezal that he has Lane hostage. Dolezal must find where she hid the $250,000 and meet Lennox on a deserted military base in the [[White Sands National Park|White Sands]] desert.\n\nDolezal uncovers the money in a briefcase buried in Lane's horse's stall. He kidnaps Meeker, takes him to White Sands, and handcuffs him to a pipe inside an abandoned building.  Dolezal explains that Lennox is CIA, the FBI will be arriving soon, and Meeker can either face punishment or try to flee.  Dolezal leaves a gun behind, so Meeker grabs it and hides inside a bathroom stall.\n\nLennox arrives and reveals that Lane is waiting at the base entrance. Dolezal placed the briefcase in the abandoned building, but when Lennox walks in, Meeker shoots and kills him.  After disabling Lennox's car, Dolezal picks up Lane. He drops her off at her estate and explains that he needs to return to his family. He hands her the $250,000 she had obtained through her pseudo-fund raising event.\n\nThe FBI arrives in cars and helicopters. Meeker breaks the pipe he was cuffed to and runs through the desert with the briefcase.  Dolezal left the original $500,000 he was originally suspected of stealing so the FBI will stop investigating him, but one of the agents notices footprints going out into White Sands, and they head off in pursuit.  As the FBI catches up with him, Meeker stumbles and drops the briefcase, which contains nothing but sand.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as Ray Dolezal\n* [[Mickey Rourke]] as Gorman Lennox\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]] as Lane Bodine\n* [[Samuel L.
