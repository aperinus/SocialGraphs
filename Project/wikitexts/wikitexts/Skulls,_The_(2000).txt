Its plot is based upon some of the [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] surrounding [[Yale University]]'s [[Skull and Bones]] student society.\n\nThe film was critically panned, but successful enough to spawn two [[direct-to-video]] sequels, ''[[The Skulls II]]'' and ''[[The Skulls III]]'', released in 2002 and 2004, respectively.\n\n== Plot ==\nLuke McNamara is a student aspiring to become a lawyer. An orphaned \"townie\" who grew up on the \"wrong side of the tracks\", he did well enough in school to attend college on a scholarship where he is a champion rower. His best friends at college are his love interest Chloe, and Will. Will is the coxswain of the Bulldog 8's rowing team and Luke is the captain. Luke's friendships become strained when he is invited to join a secret society known as \"The Skulls\". Luke passes the first part of the initiation process by stealing an artifact from a rival secret society. He does this with boxing prodigy Caleb Mandrake, who The Skulls declare his co-conspirator and \"soulmate\". Luke and Caleb are lectured in the secret ritual room by a senior Skull who is standing in front of a wall with the word \"WAR\" engraved into it in huge capital letters. A senior Skull explains that the Skulls require their members to prove themselves in war. Luke has a falling out with Will over Luke becoming a Skull.\n\nLuke strikes up a friendship with Caleb's father, Litten Mandrake. Litten is the current Chairman of the Skulls and a Federal Court Judge who is pushing for a position in the Supreme Court. Litten and his partner, Senator Ames Levritt, take an interest in Luke. Will, who has researched the Skulls for some time, discovers their ritual room.  Will gets caught in the room by Caleb and in the ensuing struggle he is knocked unconscious. Caleb is ordered to leave the room by his father, who then orders Skulls member and the University's [[Provost (education)|provost]] Martin Lombard to break Will's neck. The Skulls make it appear that Will hanged himself in his dorm room.\n\nStricken with grief over Will's death, Luke begins to suspect he was murdered by Caleb. Caleb also believes that he is guilty, suspecting Will died as a direct consequence of Caleb hitting him. Luke enlists his friends from childhood to help solve the mystery. With their help, Luke obtains the Skulls security tapes that prove Lombard committed the murder. In trying to convince Caleb of the truth, Luke realizes how scared Caleb is of his father. Before Luke can show the evidence to police, the Skulls council, who know Luke has the tapes, vote that he is no longer loyal. Ames Levritt is blackmailed into voting against Luke by Litten Mandrake, who has pictures of him with his much younger mistress. When Luke goes to the police, the tape is switched by Detective Sparrow and Luke is confined to a mental hospital.\n\nWith the help of Ames and Chloe, Luke escapes the hospital and he and Chloe survive an attempt on his life by Martin Lombard, who is shot and killed by Detective Sparrow, who is working for Levritt. Luke decides that his only option is to fight the Skulls by their own rules, and \"bring war to them\". He challenges Caleb to a duel at the Skulls' [[Deer Island (Thousand Islands)|private island]], by invoking rule 119. Litten tries to take his son's place in the duel but is denied the opportunity due to another Skull rule. After Luke and Caleb take their ten paces and turn around, Luke drops his gun and tries convincing Caleb of the truth and that he is not responsible for Will's murder. Despite being pressured by Litten to kill Luke, Caleb cannot bring himself to pull the trigger. Litten grabs a pistol and attempts to shoot Luke, but before he can fire, Caleb shoots his father. Mortified at what he has done, Caleb tries to kill himself but is stopped by Luke.\n\nLuke realizes that Senator Levritt manipulated Luke and others to bring about Litten's downfall. Luke becomes disgusted with The Skulls and refuses to participate further, despite Levritt telling him that he will be tracked down and that The Skulls will accept him because he has proven himself in war. As Luke walks away Levritt says to himself, \"Well done son, well done\".\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Joshua Jackson]] as Lucas John \"Luke\" McNamara{{spaced ndash}}The new Skulls member.\n* [[Paul Walker]] as Caleb Mandrake{{spaced ndash}}One of the new Skulls members along with Luke.\n* [[Hill Harper]] as Will Beckford{{spaced ndash}}Luke's classmate and best friend.\n* [[Leslie Bibb]] as Chloe Whitfield{{spaced ndash}}Luke's classmate and love interest.\n* [[Christopher McDonald]] as Martin Lombard{{spaced ndash}}A provost at Yale University.\n* [[Steve Harris (actor)|Steve Harris]] as Detective Sparrow{{spaced ndash}}A police detective who is in charge of investigating Will's death.\n* [[William Petersen]] as Senator Ames Levritt{{spaced ndash}} member of 1972 Skulls class, and one of the leaders of the organization.\n* [[Craig T.

I had gone to Harvard that had the dining clubs but not the skull and bones, the secret societies.\nBut I knew a lot about the secret societies, and I thought this is how the elite functions. This is how the elite knits together these bonds that take them through life and keep them in the elite heights of any society, and I was very excited about portraying that with Paul and Josh and all the cast.\nTo create this secret world of power elites\u2026 that was very exciting to me and I got the cast excited about that idea. It\u2019s interesting how many of the critics missed this and didn't understand it and blowed it off as silly. Skull and bones is a reality and the film got very close to how that reality works at Yale.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=April 7, 2018 |last=Palmer |first=Jason |title=Rob Cohen The Hurricane Heist interview |url=https://entertainment-focus.com/2018/04/07/rob-cohen-the-hurricane-heist-interview/ }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[The Brotherhood of the Bell]]'' (1970 film)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0192614|The Skulls}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|skulls|The Skulls}}\n* {{Amg movie|182469|The Skulls}}\n{{The Skulls}}\n{{Rob Cohen}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Skulls, The}}\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:2000 psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s teen films]]\n[[Category:American thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films about secret societies]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Rob Cohen]]\n[[Category:Films set in Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Hampshire]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Toronto]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Fictional secret societies]]\n[[Category:Skull and Bones Society]]\n[[Category:Original Film films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Randy Edelman]]\n[[Category:Films set in universities and colleges]]\n[[Category:Films about the upper class]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1999]]"}]}}}}
