The film stars [[Ashley Judd]], [[Greg Kinnear]], [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Marisa Tomei]], and [[Ellen Barkin]], and follows a heartbroken woman looking for a reason why she was dumped.\n\n==Plot==\nJane Goodale voices over the images of a scientific experiment where a bull would not mount a cow twice, not even if her scent is changed. Until recently, she believed men are all like the bull, but she discovers it is not always true.\n\nJane is a production assistant for a recently syndicated talk show, so host Diane Roberts who wants to be the best, is always looking for ungettable guests, like [[Fidel Castro]]. Eddie Alden is the producer and a womanizer, much to Jane's amicable critique.\n\nEddie needs a roommate, but disgruntled exes keep damaging his bulletin board posters. Offering Jane the room, she turns down vehemently. Jane is immediately smitten when she meets the new producer of the show, Ray Brown. She tells her friend Liz and discusses her bad luck with men. Meanwhile, her sister goes on fertility treatments. Ray calls Jane, they spend an evening together and end up kissing. The next morning she calls Liz, ecstatic. Liz gives her advice on Ray and his girlfriend Dee (with whom he has trouble). Ray and Jane seem to be very much in love.\n\nThe relationship evolves, and they decide to move in together. Jane puts in notice to her landlord; when Ray tells his girlfriend it is over, he does not mention the new woman in his life. Distancing himself from Jane while she is packing to move, he breaks it off over dinner, leaving her in tears. The next morning in the office Jane takes her revenge by announcing to move in with Eddie. She learns to deal with the many women in Eddie's life and they bond over scotch and leftovers. Reading an article about the old cow syndrome, she starts researching for her theory of men. Liz works at a men's magazine and proposes Jane write a column about her theory, under the pen name Dr. Marie Charles.\n\nThe column, dealing with men's insecurity and dishonesty, is a big hit. Everybody wants to meet Dr. Charles, including Diane. At a Christmas party, Ray tells her he misses her, asking her out for New Year's Eve, but stands her up. When Jane shows up at a party looking for Eddie at midnight, she can't find him and leaves in tears. He spots her across the crowded room, tries to go after her but can't reach her. Back at the office, Ray tries to apologize, but Diane interrupts wearing the shirt Jane bought for Ray.\n\nDiane is \"Dee,\" and Ray is back with her. As the board meeting is about to start, Eddie makes sure Jane isn't crying going in, but she acts strangely, so he covers for her. When Ray gets emotional talking about a [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] movie, Jane spills her guts over his inability to show empathy for her broken heart. After the meeting Diane, unaware of Jane's relationship with Ray, gives her advice on how to win her boyfriend back, telling her how she did it.\n\nAt a bar, Liz follows Dr. Charles's advice and is not going to fall for the same kind of guy anymore. Jane and Eddie argue over Dr. Charles' advice. At home she tells him she has to believe the theory because otherwise she is fears men don't leave women - they leave her. Eddie comforts her saying Ray is not the last man she'll ever love, and they fall asleep together. The next morning he wakes up happy and comfortable while Jane freaks out. He suggests she not overanalyse it, saying he is happy they slept the whole night together without it leading to sex.\n\nJane tells Eddie he will show his true colours and will hurt her soon. He tells her it is not about him, but her attitude is the problem. Jane gets a call from her brother-in-law telling her that her sister had a miscarriage. At the hospital she sees their true love and tells Diane that Dr. Charles will be on her show.\n\nThe interview is meant to be over the telephone, but Jane changes her mind mid-way and goes on the stage. She tells the audience that there is no Dr. Charles (we see Eddie leave at this point) and that the theory is ridiculous because she was hurt and needed to blame men for her pain. By this time Eddie is long gone. Jane goes after him and tells him she found new love. He doesn't answer, but kisses her passionately, to Van Morrison's \"Someone like You\" playing in the background.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Ashley Judd]] as Jane Goodale, a television show producer who researches love and the problems men have with giving it\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as Ray Brown, Jane's ex-boyfriend and the show's executive producer\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as Eddie Alden, Jane's womanizing coworker and roommate\n* [[Marisa Tomei]] as Liz, Jane's best friend\n* [[Ellen Barkin]] as Diane Roberts, the star talent of Jane's show\n* [[Catherine Dent]] as Alice, Jane's sister\n* [[Peter Friedman]] as Stephen, Alice's husband\n* [[Laura Regan]] as Evelyn\n* [[Donna Hanover]] as Mary Lou Corkle\n* [[Nicolle Rochelle|Nicole Leach]] as Nia\n* [[Colleen Camp]] as Realtor\n* [[Julie Kavner]] as Furry Animal (voice)\n* [[Sabine Singh]] as Girl in Bar\n* [[Shuler Hensley]] as Hick Farmer\n* [[Mireille Enos]] as Yoga Instructor #1\n* [[Veronica Webb]] as Herself\n* [[Naomi Judd]] as Makeup Artist\n* [[Hugh Downs]] as Himself (uncredited)\n* [[Tony Goldwyn]] as Narrator on TV (uncredited)\n* [[Chris Kerson]] as New Year's Eve Party Guest (uncredited)\n* [[Krysten Ritter]] as Model (uncredited)\n\n==Reception==\n{{Anchor|Box office}}\nThe film opened at No. 2 at the North American box office earning $10,010,600 in its opening weekend, behind ''[[Spy Kids (film)|Spy Kids]]''.
