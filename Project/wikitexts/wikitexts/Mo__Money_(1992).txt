They switch a computer tape in Ted's car before police arrive.\n\nJohnny Stewart ([[Damon Wayans]]) is a lifelong [[con man]] who performs scams with his younger brother Seymour ([[Marlon Wayans]]). When Johnny meets Amber Evans ([[Stacey Dash]]), he tries to impress her by obtaining an honest job at the company where she works\u2014Dynasty Club, a credit card firm.\n\nHe becomes a mailroom clerk. Chris Fields (Mark Beltzman) trains Johnny how to do the job. Keith threatens Chris in the men's restroom, terrifying Chris. Johnny realizes that he needs money to woo Amber. He develops a scheme to commit [[identity theft]] with the credit card information of deceased cardholders to which he has access due to his mailroom position. He justifies his actions because he knows that he is stealing from only the company and not harming the individual cardholders.\n\nLieutenant Walsh ([[Joe Santos]]), who was once the partner of Johnny's deceased father, asks Chris questions about Keith. Chris is stabbed and killed by Keith's hitman in the subway station. Lt. Walsh investigates Chris's murder and find credit card receipts on him. Keith promotes Johnny from mailroom clerk to supervisor to replace Chris.\n\nWith Seymour's help, Johnny charges large amounts of money to the cards with the intention of impressing Amber. Keith is head of security at Dynasty Club, and he also runs a virtual stolen credit card operation. He records Johnny stealing a returned credit card and pressures him to join the credit card criminal enterprise.\n\nSeymour takes a stolen credit card and attempts to buy a four-fingered ring. However, a security alarm blares, indicating the stolen card. Seymour tries to escape but is caught by mall security and questioned by police.\n\nThe police authorize a [[sting operation]] on Seymour to record Keith's conversation and to capture him. Lt. Walsh becomes furious about the operation. Keith's hitman tries to kill Johnny for blackmail until he shoots Walsh in the arm. Keith kidnaps Seymour, and Johnny goes after him until he escapes. Keith tries to kill Johnny by shooting him in the shoulder. A fight ensues between them until Johnny kills him by hanging him. Seymour and Amber visit Johnny lying in the hospital bed injured and decide to settle down.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Damon Wayans]] as Johnny Stewart / Anton Jackson / Blaine Edwards (cameo)\n*[[Stacey Dash]] as Amber Evans\n*[[Joe Santos]] as Lt.
