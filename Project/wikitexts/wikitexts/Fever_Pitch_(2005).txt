It stars [[Drew Barrymore]] and [[Jimmy Fallon]], and is a remake of the British [[Fever Pitch (1997 film)|1997 film of the same title]]. [[Nick Hornby]], who had written the [[Fever Pitch|original 1992 book]] and the 1997 screenplay adaptation, acted as an executive producer for the American remake.\n\nWhile both the book and the original 1997 film are about [[association football|soccer]], the 2005 adaptation, aimed specifically at the U.S. market, is about [[baseball]]. Both ''Fever Pitch'' films feature real-life dramatic sporting victories, the original focusing on [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal's]] last minute [[Liverpool 0\u20132 Arsenal (26 May 1989)|League title win]] in the final game of the [[1988\u201389 Football League|1988\u20131989 season]], and the remake on the [[Boston Red Sox]]'s long-awaited [[2004 World Series|World Series Championship]] in 2004, unanticipated while the film was in production.\n\nThe film was released on April 8, 2005. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $50 million.\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=February 2021}}\n7-year-old Ben Wrightman has just moved to [[Boston]] with his mother after his parents' divorce. His uncle Carl takes him to a [[Boston Red Sox]] game at [[Fenway Park]] to cheer him up. From that day on, he is a [[Red Sox Nation|die-hard Red Sox fan]] for life.\n\n23 years later, the adult Ben is still in Boston, working as a school teacher, and has inherited his uncle's season tickets. Almost all of his possessions bear the Red Sox logo (except for his toilet paper, which is of the [[New York Yankees]]). On a school trip, Ben meets Lindsey Meeks, a successful, dedicated corporate executive, and they begin dating.\n\nLindsey, who knows little about baseball or the Red Sox, learns about the [[Curse of the Bambino]] from Ben's stadium friends (including Al Waterman, a sponge salesman who also narrates the story). They continue attending the games together, but tension arises when Lindsey is up for a promotion and begins working on her laptop during the game. Lindsey is knocked out by a [[line drive]] foul and recovers but stops going to the games, suggesting Ben will have more fun if he goes with his friends.\n\nThings get worse when Lindsey invites Ben to accompany her to [[Paris]], and he declines because the Red Sox are in the heat of the pennant race. Before leaving, she tells Ben she might be pregnant. She expresses concern that he is more committed to the Red Sox than to her, and days later calls him and confirms she isn't pregnant. To prove he is not obsessed, he misses a game [[Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry|against the Yankees]] to escort Lindsey to her friend's birthday party. Ben and Lindsey enjoy the party, and after making love, he tells her it was one of the best nights of his life. Moments later, he gets an ecstatic call from his friend Troy, who tells him the Sox overcame a seven-run deficit in the bottom of the ninth to pull off one of the greatest comebacks in team history. Ben becomes irate that he missed such an historic Red Sox moment, blaming Lindsey for making him miss the game. She is heartbroken, and they separate.\n\nBen soon misses Lindsey and visits her in a futile attempt to reconcile. To prove she means more to him than the Red Sox, he plans to sell his season tickets. Lindsey finds out during the celebration for her much-anticipated promotion and rushes to stop him. She gets in during the 9th inning of the [[2004 American League Championship Series#Game 4|Red Sox\u2013Yankees playoff game]] when the Red Sox are just three outs away from being swept, and Ben is in the stands about to finalize the ticket sale. Desperate to reach Ben, Lindsey runs across the field and running around players to avoid security. She tears up the contract and tells Ben that if he loves her enough to sell his seats, then she loves him enough not to let him to do it. They reunite and kiss in front of the entire crowd before Lindsey is arrested.\n\nAl narrates the epilogue: the Red Sox won that game and then beat the Yankees three more times to win the [[American League]] [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]], later sweeping the [[National League]] champion [[St. Louis Cardinals]] for their first [[World Series]] title in 86 years. Lindsay and Ben travel to [[Busch Stadium (II)|Busch Stadium]] in St. Louis for the decisive [[2004 World Series|Game 4]]. Eventually they marry, and Lindsey conceives a 'player to be named later'. Al explains that the baby will be named [[Ted Williams]] Wrightman if it's a boy, \"[[Carl Yastrzemski|Carla Yastrzemski]]\" Wrightman if it's a girl, adding, \"Let's all hope for a boy.\" A post-credit scene shows a bunch of kids (presumably Ben & Lindsey's and their friends') chanting \"LET'S GO, RED SOX!\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Jimmy Fallon]] as Ben Wrightman\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Lindsey Meeks\n* [[James Sikking]] as Doug Meeks\n* [[JoBeth Williams]] as Maureen Meeks\n* [[Jason Spevack]] as Ben in 1980\n* [[Jack Kehler]] as Al Waterman (also the narrator)\n* [[Lenny Clarke]] as Uncle Carl\n* [[Ione Skye]] as Molly\n* [[Siobhan Fallon Hogan]] as Lana\n* [[KaDee Strickland]] as Robin\n* [[Marissa Jaret Winokur]] as Sarah\n* [[Evan Helmuth]] as Troy\n* [[Zen Gesner]] as Steve\n* [[Jackie Burroughs]] as Mrs. Warren\n* [[Stephen King]] as Himself\n* [[Kris Williams (investigator)|Kris Williams]] as Herself\n* [[Steve Levy]] as Himself\n* [[Willie Garson]] as Kevin\n* [[Armando Riesco]] as Gerard\n* [[Brett Murphy]] as Ryan\n* [[Andrew Wilson (actor)|Andrew Wilson]] as Grant Wade / Patrick Lyons\n{{div col end}}\n\nSeveral [[Boston Red Sox]] personnel make appearances in the film, including: players [[Johnny Damon]], [[Trot Nixon]], [[Jason Varitek]] and [[Jim Rice]], and announcers [[Joe Castiglione]], [[Don Orsillo]] and [[Dennis Eckersley]].\n\n==Production==\nThe original plot had assumed the [[Boston Red Sox|Red Sox]] would lose in the playoffs. However, the Red Sox stunned the baseball world when they won four straight games to win the [[2004 American League Championship Series|2004 ALCS]] against the rival [[New York Yankees|Yankees]] (becoming the first [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] team to win a seven-game series after losing the first three games) and subsequent [[2004 World Series|World Series]] against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] to break the \"[[Curse of the Bambino]]\". Thus, the ending had to be rewritten. On the day of Game 4, with the Red Sox on the verge of a sweep, The Farrellys decided to bring Barrymore, Fallon, and a film crew to St. Louis hours before the first pitch \u2013 and Barrymore and Fallon attended the game at [[Busch Stadium II|Busch Stadium]] in character. When the Red Sox made the final out to secure a 3\u20130 win over the Cardinals that broke the Curse, Fox cameras on the live broadcast caught Barrymore and Fallon, as Lindsey and Ben, running onto the field and kissing to celebrate.<ref>{{cite magazine |title = Sox Change |url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,767456,00.html |magazine = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | first=Whitney |last=Pastorek |date=November 12, 2004}}</ref> The film, with its updated ending, was also screened at Fenway Park the following August on a screen in center field.<ref>Perry Eaton (July 31, 2015).
