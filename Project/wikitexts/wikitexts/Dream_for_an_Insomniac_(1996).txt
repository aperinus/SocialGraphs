Frankie suffers from [[insomnia]], and has not slept through the night since childhood, when her parents were killed in a car accident. She spends most of her time at night reading. Writer David Shrader (Mackenzie Astin), takes a job at the cafe, and Frankie falls in love with him, while he attempts to cure her insomnia, she reads his writings, and the two take turns reciting philosophical quotes and guessing their source. The film is shot in black and white until Frankie sees David, when the film switches to color and David's eyes are revealed as blue. David breaks Frankie's heart when she finds out that he is engaged to a lawyer, Molly (Leslie Stevens), but he eventually chooses Frankie over his fianc\u00e9, and visits her in [[Los Angeles]], where she has joined Allison, who is exploring an acting career. The film ends with Frankie falling asleep in David's arms. A subplot has Rob ([[Michael Landes]]), the gay son of Leo ([[Seymour Cassel]]), trying to convince his father he is straight, with the help of Allison \"acting\" as his girlfriend. After Allison and Frankie leave, Rob [[Coming out|comes out of the closet]] to his father, who in fact had known and accepted that Rob was gay for many years.<ref>{{cite news|last=Holden |first=Stephen |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F02E5DC1E3DF93AA25755C0A96E958260 |title=''Dream for an Insomniac'' reviewed at New York Times |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date=1998-06-19 |access-date=2013-12-04}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ione Skye]] as Frankie\n* [[Jennifer Aniston]] as Allison\n* [[Mackenzie Astin]] as David Shrader\n* [[Michael Landes]] as Rob\n* [[Seymour Cassel]] as Uncle Leo\n* Sean Blackman as Juice\n* Michael Sterk as B.J.\n* Leslie Stevens as Molly Monday\n* [[Robert Kelker-Kelly]] as Trent \n* [[David Rainey]] as Delivery Man\n\n==Reception==\nThe film earned only $26,000 domestically.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://secure.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=dreamforaninsomniac.htm |title=Dream for an Insomniac (1998) - Box Office Mojo |publisher=Secure.boxofficemojo.com |date=1998-07-14 |access-date=2013-12-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184514/http://secure.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=dreamforaninsomniac.htm |archive-date=2013-10-29 }}</ref> [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave it a cumulative rating of 50%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dream_for_an_insomniac/ |title=''Dream for an Insomniac'' at |publisher=Rottentomatoes.com |date=2007-02-13 |access-date=2013-12-04}}</ref> Jennifer Aniston's performance was praised by critics.
