Freely adapted from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', it tells the story of a thief who falls in love with the daughter of the [[Caliph]] of Baghdad. In 1996, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/T/ThiefOfBagdad1924.html ''The Thief of Bagdad'' at silentera.com database]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=May 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\nFairbanks considered this to be the favorite of his films, according to his son.<ref>Vance, Jeffrey (2008).

Fairbanks biographer [[Jeffrey Vance]] writes, \"An epic romantic fantasy-adventure inspired by several of the Arabian Nights tales, ''The Thief of Bagdad'' is the greatest artistic triumph of Fairbanks's career. The superb visual design, spectacle, imaginative splendor, and visual effects, along with his bravura performance (leading a cast of literally thousands), all contribute to making this his masterpiece.\"<ref>Vance, Jeffrey (2008).

Wandering into a [[mosque]], he tells the holy man he disdains his religion; his philosophy is, \"What I want, I take.\"\n\nThat night, he sneaks into the palace of the caliph using a magic rope he stole during [[Salat|ritual prayers]]. All thoughts of plunder are forgotten when he sees the sleeping princess, the caliph's daughter. The princess's Mongol slave alerts the guards, but he gets away.\n\nWhen his associate Abu reminds the disconsolate Ahmed that a bygone thief once stole another princess during the reign of [[Haroun al-Rashid]], Ahmed sets out to do the same. The next day is the princess's birthday. Three princes arrive, seeking her hand in marriage (and the future inheritance of the city). Another of the princess's slaves foretells that she will marry the man who first touches a rose-tree in her garden. The princess watches anxiously as first the glowering Prince of the Indies, then the obese Prince of Persia and finally the Prince of the Mongols pass by the rose-tree. The mere sight of the Mongol fills the princess with fear, but when Ahmed appears (disguised in stolen garments as a suitor), she is delighted. The Mongol slave tells her countryman of the prophecy, but before he can touch the rose-tree, Ahmed's startled horse tosses its rider into it.\n\nThat night, following ancient custom, the princess chooses Ahmed for her husband. Out of love, Ahmed gives up his plan to abduct her and confesses all to her in private. The Mongol prince learns from his spy, the princess's Mongol slave, that Ahmed is a common thief and informs the caliph. Ahmed is lashed mercilessly, and the caliph orders he be torn apart by a giant ape, but the princess has the guards bribed to let him go.\n\nWhen the caliph insists she select another husband, her loyal slave advises her to delay. She asks that the princes each bring her a gift after \"seven moons\"; she will marry the one who brings her the rarest. In despair, Ahmed turns to the holy man. He tells the thief to become a prince, revealing to him the peril-fraught path to a great treasure.\n\nThe Prince of the Indies obtains a magic [[crystal ball]] from the eye of a giant idol, which shows whatever he wants to see, while the Persian prince buys a [[magic carpet|flying carpet]]. The Mongol prince leaves behind his henchman, telling him to organize the soldiers he will send to Bagdad disguised as porters. (The potentate has sought all along to take the city; the beautiful princess is only an added incentive.) After he lays his hands on a magic apple which has the power to [[panacea (medicine)|cure anything]], even death, he sends word to the Mongol slave to poison the princess. After many adventures, Ahmed gains a [[cloak of invisibility]] and a small chest of magic powder which turns into whatever he wishes when he sprinkles it. He races back to the city.\n\nThe three princes meet as agreed at a caravanserai before returning to Bagdad. The Mongol asks the Indian to check whether the princess has waited for them. They discover that she is near death, and ride the flying carpet to reach her. Then the Mongol uses the apple to cure her. The suitors argue over which gift is rarest, but the princess points out that without any one gift, the remaining two would have been useless in saving her.  Her loyal slave shows her Ahmed in the crystal ball, so the princess convinces her father to deliberate carefully on his future son-in-law. The Mongol prince chooses not to wait, unleashing his secret army that night and capturing Bagdad.\n\nAhmed arrives at the city gate, shut and defended by Mongols. When he conjures up a large army with his powder, the Mongol soldiers flee. The Mongol prince is about to have one of his soldiers kill him when the Mongol slave suggests he escape with the princess on the flying carpet. Ahmed liberates the city and rescues the princess, using his cloak of invisibility to get through the Mongols guarding their prince. In gratitude, the caliph gives his daughter to him in marriage.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Douglas Fairbanks]] as Ahmed, the Thief of Bagdad\n* [[Snitz Edwards]] as His Evil Associate\n* [[Charles Belcher (actor)|Charles Belcher]] as The Holy Man (Imam) / Narrator\n* [[Julanne Johnston]] as The Princess.

Wilson composed leit-motifs for each character and developed them symphonically. He also spent many hours in the editing room working on combining his music with the film. The score has been re-constructed by Mark Fitz-Gerald and recorded.<ref>Mortimer Wilson: [http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2022/May/Wilson-thief-FHR126.htm ''The Thief of Bagdad, Op. 74''], First Hand Records FHR126 (2022) reviewed at ''MusicWeb International''</ref> A 1924 Literary Digest article details Wilson's work on the film (and includes a photo of the composer).<ref>\"A Higher Order of Music for the Movies\", in ''Literary Digest'', 19 July 1924, p. 26-27.</ref> Wilson also wrote the music for Fairbanks\u2019s next two films, ''[[Don Q, Son of Zorro]]'' (1925) and ''[[The Black Pirate]]'' (1926).\n\n==Reception==\n[[Glenn Erickson]] praised the film, writing:\n<blockquote>\nEvery age has its wonder entertainments, and 1924's The Thief of Bagdad transported audiences to a new level of imaginative fantasy. It had the biggest star of the era in a production that dwarfed anything anyone had ever seen ... It has sets bigger than those in Intolerance and costumed crowd scenes to rival the enormous Italian spectacles of the day. What's more, the picture is packed with elaborate special effects, many of which still have the power to impress. ... Some critics prefer Douglas Fairbanks' earlier modern-day adventures to his twenties' costume epics, but this dazzler still takes people's heads off. Simply put, the production's overall design and execution -- sets, costumes, lighting, special effects -- are coordinated so tightly that the illusion of grandeur is complete.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s4109bagd.html |title=The Thief of Bagdad |first=Glenn |last=Erickson |publisher=[[DVD Talk]]}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nDarragh O'Donoghue is of the opinion that:\n<blockquote>\n\"The first reel provides some of the purest joy the silent cinema can offer. ... Where initially there had been a satisfying equivalence between the discrete adventures of Ahmed as a psychologically plausible thief in medieval Mesopotamia and Ahmed as a universal Everyman figure, in the film's latter two-thirds, the former distinctive superstructure gives way to a kind of Pilgrim\u2019s Progress in Orientalist drag. ... Adventure sequences are staged like fairground tableaux and have none of the interest in physical process or emotional investment that made the early reels so exciting. ... After promising a dream, this great but flawed film eventually sends its audience to sleep.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.sensesofcinema.com/2017/cteq/the-thief-of-bagdad/ |title=The Thief of Bagdad (Raoul Walsh, 1924) |first=Darragh |last=O'Donoghue |magazine=[[Senses of Cinema]] |date=September 2017}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Honors==\nIn June 2008, the [[American Film Institute]] revealed its ''[[AFI's 10 Top 10|10 Top 10]]'', the 10 best films in 10 \"classic\" American film genres.
