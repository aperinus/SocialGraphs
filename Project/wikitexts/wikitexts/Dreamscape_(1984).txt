When he was 19 years old, Alex had been the prime subject of a scientific research project documenting his psychic ability but, in the midst of the study, he disappeared. After running afoul of a local [[gangster]]/[[extortion]]ist named Snead ([[Redmond Gleeson]]), Alex evades two of Snead's thugs by allowing himself to be taken by two men: Finch ([[Chris Mulkey]]) and Babcock ([[Peter Jason]]), who identify themselves as being from an academic institution.\n\nAt the institution, Alex is reunited with his former mentor Dr. Paul Novotny ([[Max von Sydow]]) who is now involved in government-funded psychic research. Novotny, aided by fellow scientist Dr. Jane DeVries ([[Kate Capshaw]]), has developed a technique that allows psychics to voluntarily link with the minds of others by projecting themselves into the subconscious during [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]]. Novotny equates the original idea for the dreamscape project to the practice of the [[Senoi]] natives of Malaysia, who believe the dream world is just as real as reality.\n\nThe project was intended for clinical use to diagnose and treat [[sleep disorders]], particularly [[nightmare]]s, but it has been hijacked by Bob Blair ([[Christopher Plummer]]), a powerful government agent. Novotny convinces Alex to join the program in order to investigate Blair's intentions. Alex gains experience with the technique by helping a man who is worried about his wife's infidelity and by treating a young boy named Buddy (Cory Yothers), who is plagued with nightmares so terrible that a previous psychic lost his sanity trying to help him. Buddy's nightmare involves a large sinister \"snake-man.\u201d\n\nA subplot involving Alex and Jane's growing infatuation culminates with him sneaking into Jane's dream to have sex with her. He does this without technological aid\u2014something no one else has been able to achieve. With the help of novelist Charlie Prince ([[George Wendt]]), who has been covertly investigating the project for a new book, Alex learns that Blair intends to use the dream-linking technique for [[assassination]].\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Dreamscape5.jpg|thumbnail|150px|right|Tommy Ray Glatman, dream assassin]] -->\nBlair murders Prince and Novotny to silence them. The [[president of the United States]] ([[Eddie Albert]]) is admitted as a patient due to recurring nightmares. Blair assigns Tommy Ray Glatman ([[David Patrick Kelly]]), a mentally unstable psychic who murdered his own father, to enter the president's nightmare and assassinate him\u2014people who die in their dreams also die in the real world. Blair considers the president's nightmares about [[nuclear holocaust]] as a sign of political weakness, which he deems a liability in the upcoming negotiations for [[nuclear disarmament]].\n\nAlex projects himself into the president's dream\u2014a nightmare of a post nuclear war wasteland\u2014to try and protect him. After a fight in which Tommy rips out a police officer's heart, Tommy attempts to incite a mutant-mob against the president, and he battles Alex in the form of the snake-man from Buddy's dream. Alex assumes the appearance of Tommy's murdered father ([[Eric Gold]]) in order to distract him, allowing the president to impale him with a spear. The president is grateful to Alex but reluctant to confront Blair, who wields considerable political power. To protect himself and Jane, Alex enters Blair's dream and kills him before Blair can retaliate.\n\nThe film ends with Jane and Alex boarding a train to [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]], intent on making their previous dream encounter a reality. They are surprised to meet the ticket collector from Jane's dream, but they decide to ignore it and keep on.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Alex Gardner\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as Dr. Paul Novotny\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Bob Blair\n* [[Kate Capshaw]] as Jane DeVries\n* [[David Patrick Kelly]] as Tommy Ray Glatman\n* [[George Wendt]] as Charlie Prince\n* [[Eddie Albert]] as The President\n* [[Chris Mulkey]] as Gary Finch\n* [[Larry Gelman]] as Mr. Webber\n* Cory Yothers as Buddy\n* [[Redmond Gleeson]] as Snead\n* Eric Gold as Tommy Ray's father\n* [[Peter Jason]] as Roy Babcock\n* Jana Taylor as Mrs. Webber\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=June 2016}}\nAccording to author [[Roger Zelazny]], the film developed from an initial outline that he wrote in 1981, based in part upon his [[novella]] \"He Who Shapes\" and 1966 novel ''[[The Dream Master]]''. He was not involved in the project after [[20th Century Fox]] bought his outline. Because he did not write the film treatment or the script, his name does not appear in the credits; assertions that he removed his name from the credits are unfounded.<ref>\"...And Call Me Roger\": The Literary Life of Roger Zelazny, Part 4, by Christopher S.
