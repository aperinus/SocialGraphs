It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won 10, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] (in addition to a special award for Robbins), becoming the record holder for the most wins for a musical.

The Jets, a group of whites led by Riff, brawl with the Sharks, [[Stateside Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]]s led by Bernardo. Lieutenant Schrank and Officer Krupke arrive and break it up. The Jets challenge the Sharks to a [[Street fighting|rumble]] to be held after an upcoming dance.\n\nRiff wants his best friend Tony, the co-founder and former member of the Jets, to fight at the rumble. Riff invites Tony to the dance, but Tony says he senses something important is coming. Riff suggests it could happen at the dance. Tony finally agrees to go. Meanwhile, Bernardo's younger sister, Maria, tells her best friend and Bernardo's girlfriend, Anita, how excited she is about the dance. At the dance, the two gangs and their girls refuse to intermingle. Tony arrives; he and Maria fall in love instantly, but Bernardo angrily demands that Tony stay away from her. Riff proposes a midnight meeting with Bernardo at Doc's drug store to settle the rules for the rumble.\n\nMaria is sent home; Anita argues that Bernardo is overprotective of Maria, and they compare the advantages of Puerto Rico and the mainland United States. Tony sneaks onto Maria's fire escape where they reaffirm their love. Krupke, who suspects the Jets are planning something, warns them not to cause trouble. The Sharks arrive, and the gangs agree to a showdown the following evening under the highway, with a one-on-one fistfight. When Schrank arrives, the gangs feign friendship. Schrank orders the Sharks out and fails to discover information about the fight.\n\nThe next day at the bridal shop where they work, Anita accidentally tells Maria about the rumble. Tony arrives to see Maria. Anita, shocked, warns them about the consequences if Bernardo learns of their relationship. Maria makes Tony promise to prevent the rumble. Tony and Maria fantasize about their wedding.\n\nThe gangs approach the area under the highway. Tony arrives to stop the fight, but Bernardo antagonizes him. Unwilling to watch Tony be humiliated, Riff initiates a knife fight. Tony intervenes, leading to Bernardo stabbing and killing Riff. Tony kills Bernardo with Riff's knife, and a melee ensues. Police sirens blare, and everyone flees, leaving behind the dead bodies. Maria waits for Tony on the roof of her apartment building; her fianc\u00e9 Chino (an [[arranged marriage|arranged engagement]]) arrives and tells her what happened. Tony arrives and asks for Maria's forgiveness. He plans to turn himself in to the police. Maria is devastated but confirms her love for Tony and asks him to stay.\n\nThe Jets and their new leader, Ice, reassemble outside a garage and focus on reacting to the police. Anybodys arrives and warns them that Chino is after Tony with a gun. Ice sends the Jets to warn Tony. A grieving Anita enters the apartment while Tony and Maria are in the bedroom. The lovers arrange to meet at Doc's, where they will pick up getaway money to elope. Anita spots Tony leaving through the window and chides Maria for the relationship with Bernardo's killer, but Maria convinces her to help them elope. Schrank arrives and questions Maria about the rumble. Maria sends Anita to tell Tony that Maria is detained from meeting him.\n\nWhen Anita reaches Doc's, the Jets harass and even try to rape her, when Doc appears and intervenes. Anita angrily lies, saying that Chino has killed Maria. Doc banishes the Jets, gives Tony his getaway money and delivers Anita's message. Tony, distraught, runs into the streets, shouting for Chino to kill him, too. In the playground next to Doc's, Tony spots Maria and they run toward each other, only for Chino to shoot Tony. The gangs arrive to find Maria holding Tony, who dies in her arms. Maria stops the gangs from fighting, takes the gun from Chino and threatens to shoot everyone, blaming their hate for the deaths. Schrank and Krupke arrive to arrest Chino, and the gangs unite to carry Tony\u2019s body away in a funeral procession with Maria following, the feud finally over.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Natalie Wood]] as Maria, Bernardo's younger sister and Chino's arranged fianc\u00e9e,<ref name=\"Miller 2019\" /> who falls in love with Tony\n** [[Marni Nixon]] as Maria's singing voice (also Anita's singing voice in Quintet)\n* [[Richard Beymer]] as Tony, co-founder and one-time member of the Jets and best friend of Riff, who works at Doc's drugstore and falls in love with Maria\n** [[Jimmy Bryant (singer)|Jimmy Bryant]] as Tony's singing voice\n* [[Russ Tamblyn]] as Riff, leader of the Jets, best friend of Tony\n** [[Tucker Smith]] as Riff's singing voice for \"Jet Song\"\n* [[Rita Moreno]] as Anita, Bernardo's girlfriend, and Maria's closest confidante\n** [[Betty Wand]] as Anita's singing voice for \"A Boy Like That\"\n* [[George Chakiris]] as Bernardo, leader of the Sharks, older brother of Maria and Anita's boyfriend\n* [[Simon Oakland]] as Police Lieutenant Schrank, a hard-boiled plainclothes detective\n* [[Ned Glass]] as Doc, Tony's boss;

[[Tony Mordente]], who played A-Rab on stage, was cast as Action in the film, and [[George Chakiris]], Riff in the London stage production, played Bernardo in the film. [[Tucker Smith]], who joined the Broadway production several months into its run, played Diesel, renamed Ice for the film.

Though Nixon had recorded the songs in the same orchestra sessions as Wood, she had to re-record them to synch with Wood's filmed performances.

However, Moreno sang her own vocals in \"America\". Marni Nixon sang some of Moreno's parts in the \"Quintet\" when illness prevented Moreno from doing so.
