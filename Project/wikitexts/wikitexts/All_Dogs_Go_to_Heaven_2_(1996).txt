[[Dom DeLuise]] reprises his role from the first film, alongside new cast members [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Ernest Borgnine]] and [[Bebe Neuwirth]], respectively. New characters are voiced by [[Sheena Easton]], [[Adam Wylie]] and [[George Hearn]].\n\n[[Don Bluth]], the director of the original film, had no involvement with it. It was the second of only two theatrical sequels to a film directed by [[Don Bluth]] to not involve Bluth himself, the first being ''[[An American Tail: Fievel Goes West]]'', as 13 sequels to ''[[The Land Before Time (film)|The Land Before Time]]'' and [[The Secret of NIMH 2: Timmy to the Rescue|a single sequel]] to ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' were direct-to-video releases along with two sequels of ''[[An American Tail]]'' in 1998\u20132000, as well as ''[[An All Dogs Christmas Carol]]''. This was [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s last theatrically released animated film until ''[[Igor (film)|Igor]]'' (2008). It had a DVD double feature release with the first one on March 14, 2006 and January 18, 2011. It was also released on Blu-ray on March 29, 2011.  The film also served as the series premiere for the ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series]]''.  \n\n==Plot==\n<!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 and 700 words-->\nNearly 60 years after [[All Dogs Go to Heaven|the events of the first film]], Charlie B. Barkin welcomes his friend, Itchy, to [[Heaven]], but states that he is disillusioned by the afterlife. Their old nemesis, Carface Caruthers, steals [[Gabriel]]'s Horn, but loses it somewhere over [[San Francisco]] in his attempt to escape with it. When the head angel Annabelle announces the horn's theft, Charlie submits his candidacy to retrieve it, reminding Annabelle of his familiarity with street life. Annabelle sends Charlie and Itchy to Earth to retrieve it, and gives them one miracle to use. Upon arrival in San Francisco, Charlie and Itchy attempt to indulge in their old habits, but they discover that they are [[ghost]]s, and therefore unable to interact with the physical world. At a tavern where Charlie is enchanted by a beautiful and charming [[Irish Setter]] named Sasha La Fleur, Carface appears in a [[Human body|corporeal]] form granted by a red dog collar created by Red, an elderly dog fortune teller who gives Charlie and Itchy equivalent collars effective for a single day. Unbeknownst to the duo, Red is actually a large [[demon]]ic [[cat]] who intends to take the horn for himself with Carface's help.\n\nCharlie and Itchy meet Sasha and an 8-year-old human boy she is looking after named David, who ran away from home to become a [[Street performance|street]] [[Magic (illusion)|magician]]. Charlie uses his miracle to grant Sasha the ability to converse with David, who comes to believe that Charlie is his [[guardian angel]]. Charlie sees the horn being taken into an [[San Francisco Police Department|SFPD]] police station and recovers it, but in his reluctance to return to Heaven, he hides it in a [[lobster trap]]. After David's street performance ends in failure, he finally reveals that he believes that his father and stepmother, who are expecting a new baby, will care less for him once it is born. Charlie persuades him otherwise and promises to return him home, but privately expresses to Sasha his doubts on being able to fulfill his promise. Charlie and Itchy's collars vanish, and they once more become ghosts.\n\nCarface kidnaps David and orders Charlie to bring Gabriel's horn to [[Alcatraz Island]] and give it to Red in exchange for David's life. Determined to keep his word, Charlie satisfies Red's demand, and Red uses the horn to capture and imprison Heaven's canine angels in Alcatraz while opening a portal to permanently connect the human world to [[Hell]]. After a struggle against Red, Charlie regains the horn and plays it to free the angels and send Red and Carface \u2013 the latter having sold his soul for his collar \u2013 back to Hell. Charlie and Itchy are spirited away to Heaven, and Charlie gives the horn back to Annabelle in exchange for a new life. Charlie bids farewell to Itchy, who decides to remain in Heaven, and while Annabelle and Itchy return to Heaven, Charlie returns to San Francisco and happily reunites with Sasha and David. David returns home and reconciles with his relieved father and stepmother. Charlie and Sasha, who have become mates, are adopted by David's family as pets.\n<!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 and 700 words-->\n\n==Voice cast== \n[[Burt Reynolds]], [[Vic Tayback]] and [[Melba Moore]] are replaced by [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Ernest Borgnine]] and [[Bebe Neuwirth]]; however, three characters were written out of the [[sequel]]. Anne-Marie was written out of the story, out of respect to her actress [[Judith Barsi]] who was murdered on July 25, 1988, while Killer and Flo were written out of the story as well.\n\n;Main characters\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as Charles \"Charlie\" B. Barkin, a [[German Shepherd]] who returns from Heaven to find Gabriel's Horn. It is revealed that as a puppy, he ran away from home (which explains the absence of Charlie's parents, who were briefly shown in the original film in the records book in the song \"Let Me Be Surprised\"), a point he mentions to David to convince him to return home. Charlie Sheen replaced [[Burt Reynolds]] from the first film.\n** [[Jesse Corti]] as Charlie's singing voice. \n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as Itchiford \"Itchy\" [[Dachshund]], Charlie's best friend. He wants to find the horn and go straight back to Heaven. Dom DeLuise was the only original actor to reprise his role from the first film.\n* [[Sheena Easton]] as Sasha la Fleur, an attractive [[Irish Setter]], talented lounge singer and Charlie's love interest. \n* [[Adam Wylie]] as David, a disillusioned 8-year-old human boy and Sasha's owner. He believes that Charlie and Itchy are his guardian angels sent to get him back home safely. He replaces the role of Anne-Marie from the original film.\n* [[George Hearn]] as Red, a large beast-like demonic cat from Hell and the main antagonist. His goal is to imprison the dogs of Heaven, overthrow humanity, and permanently join Hell with the mortal world. To manipulate his victims, he disguises himself as a blinded elderly dog through his ability to transform (shapeshifting). \n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as Annabelle, the archangel [[Whippet]] in Heaven. She summons Charlie and Itchy to retrieve [[Gabriel]]'s stolen Horn.\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Carface Caruthers, Charlie's arch-enemy, a [[Pit bull]]/[[bulldog]] mix, who becomes a henchman to Red through a deal between them. Contradictory to his aggressive personality in the original film, he appears quite slow-witted and timid in this film.\n;Supporting characters\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as [[Labrador Retriever|Labrador]] MC, the duplicitous MC at Sasha's lounge.\n* [[Hamilton Camp]] as Gavin, a [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]]. He waits for dogs especially a dog who puts on some weight to be healthy called Fluffy.\n* [[Dan Castellaneta]] as Tall Customs Dog\n* [[Pat Corley]] as Officer McDowell\n* [[Jim Cummings]] as Jingles, a [[Yorkshire Terrier]] who got kicked out of the sing-off, but was given the first place bone by Sasha.\n* [[Bobby Di Cicco]] as Tom, David's father.\n* Annette Helde as Claire, David's loving, [[pregnancy|pregnant]] step-mother.\n* Marabina Jaimes as Officer Reyes\n* [[Tony Jay]] as Reginald\n* [[Maurice LaMarche]] as Lost & Found Officer\n* [[Steve Mackall]] as Short Customs Dog\n* [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] as Ace the [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]] / Officer Andrews\n\n==Production==\n[[David Feiss]] served as an in-house supervising animator, storyboard artist and character designer for the state-side production. Much of the film's animation was outsourced to foreign studios, such as [[Wang Film Productions]] in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]] (from which Yang Chih Tsang was the directing animator) and its [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]-based division (from which Jov Huang and Shih-fu Liao were supervising animators), [[Phoenix Animation Studios|Phoenix Animation]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] (from which Julian Harris was the directing animator), [[A. Film Production|A-Film]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] (from which Jorgen Lerdam was the directing animator), Dino Animation in [[London]], [[England]] (from which Dino Athanassiou was a sequence director), [[House of Cool#Red Rover Studios|Red Rover]] in London, England (from which Andy Knight was a directing animator), Scowling Wolf in [[St Leonards, New South Wales|St Leonards]], [[Australia]] (from which Peter Sheehan and Richard Zaloudek were art directors), Catflap Animation in [[Crows Nest, New South Wales|Crows Nest]], Australia (from which Maurice Glacomini was a supervising animator), Franck & Franck in [[Paris]], [[France]] (from which Emmanuel Franck was a supervising animator) and Screen Animation Ireland LTD ( formerly [[Don Bluth Entertainment]]) in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]].\n\n==Music==\n\n[[Mark Watters]] composed the score for the film.
