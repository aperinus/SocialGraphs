Produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] in association with [[Barry Josephson]]'s [[Barry Josephson|Josephson Entertainment]] and [[Barry Sonnenfeld]]'s [[Barry Sonnenfeld|Right Coast Productions]], the film stars [[Amy Adams]], [[Patrick Dempsey]], [[James Marsden]], [[Timothy Spall]], [[Idina Menzel]], [[Rachel Covey]], and [[Susan Sarandon]]. It focuses on an archetypal [[Disney Princess|Disney princess]]-to-be exiled from her animated world into the live-action world of [[New York City]].\n\nThe film is both a [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to and a [[self-parody]] of [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney's animated features]] making numerous references to past works through the combination of live-action filmmaking, [[traditional animation]], and [[computer-generated imagery]]. It also marks the return of traditional animation to a Disney feature film after the company's decision to move entirely to computer animation in 2004. Composer [[Alan Menken]] and lyricist [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]], who had written songs for previous Disney films, wrote and produced the songs of ''Enchanted'', and Menken also composed the film's score. The animated sequences were produced at [[James Baxter (animator)|James Baxter Animation]] in Pasadena. Filming of the live-action segments took place around [[New York City]].\n\n''Enchanted'' premiered on October 20, 2007 at the [[London Film Festival]], and went into its [[wide release]] in the United States on November 21. It was critically well-received, established Adams as a leading lady, and earned more than $340 million worldwide at the box office.<ref name=\"BOMojo\">{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=enchanted.htm |title=Enchanted |access-date=December 20, 2008 |work= [[Box Office Mojo]] }}</ref> It won three [[Saturn Awards]], [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film|Best Fantasy Film]], [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Adams and [[Saturn Award for Best Music|Best Music]] for Menken. ''Enchanted'' also received two nominations at the [[65th Golden Globe Awards]] and three [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] nominations at the [[80th Academy Awards]]. This is the first [[Walt Disney Pictures]] film to be distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (since Touchstone Pictures' ''[[Dan in Real Life]]'') after Disney stopped using its [[Buena Vista Pictures Distribution]] brand. A sequel, ''[[Disenchanted (film)|Disenchanted]]'', is set for release on [[Disney+]] on November 18, 2022.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[Animated cartoon|animated]] [[fairy tale]] kingdom of Andalasia, Narissa, the corrupt and ruthless queen and a dark [[Sorceress (fantasy)|sorceress]], schemes to protect her claim to the throne, which she will lose once her stepson, Prince Edward, finds his [[Chivalric romance|true love]] and marries. She enlists her loyal servant Nathaniel to keep Edward distracted by hunting [[troll]]s. Giselle, a young woman, dreams of meeting a prince and experiencing a \"[[happy ending|happily ever after]]\". She, her chipmunk friend Pip, and animals from the forest work together to make a homemade statue of her true love she saw in a dream. Edward hears Giselle singing and sets off to find her. Nathaniel frees a captured troll to get rid of Giselle, but Edward rescues her. She and Edward are instantly attracted to each other and plan to be married the following day.\n\nDisguised as an old hag, Narissa intercepts Giselle on her way to the wedding and pushes her into a well, where Giselle is magically transformed into a live-action version of herself and transported to New York's [[Times Square]] in the real reality. Giselle, frightened and confused, quickly becomes lost and homeless. Meanwhile, Robert, a single father and divorce lawyer, prepares to propose to his girlfriend Nancy. Robert and his young daughter Morgan encounter Giselle on their way home, and Robert begrudgingly allows Giselle to stay the night in their apartment at the insistence of Morgan, who believes Giselle is a princess.\n\nPip and Edward embark on a rescue mission to the real world, where they too are turned into live-action versions of themselves. Pip, now a real [[chipmunk]], no longer has the ability to speak, and only communicates through squeaks. Narissa sends Nathaniel to follow and impede Edward. Narissa appears to Nathaniel and gives him three poisoned apples that will put whoever eats one to sleep until the clock strikes twelve, after which they will die. Meanwhile, after Giselle summons birds, insects and [[vermin]] to clean Robert's apartment, Nancy arrives to take Morgan to school. She meets Giselle and leaves, assuming Robert was unfaithful. Robert is initially upset but he spends the day with Giselle, knowing she is vulnerable in the city. Giselle questions Robert about his relationship with Nancy, and helps the pair reconcile by sending Nancy flowers and an invitation to a costume [[Ball (dance party)|ball]] at the [[Woolworth Building]].\n\nEdward locates Giselle at Robert's apartment. While Edward is eager to take Giselle home to Andalasia and marry her, she suggests that they should first go on a date and get to know each other better. Giselle promises to return to Andalasia after the ball that night, which Robert and Nancy also attend. Narissa decides to come to the real world and kill Giselle herself after Nathaniel fails twice to poison her. At the ball, Robert and Giselle dance romantically with each other. Giselle and Edward then prepare to depart, but Giselle feels depressed at leaving Robert behind. Narissa appears as the old hag and offers the last poisoned apple to Giselle, promising that it will erase her sorrowful memories. Giselle takes a bite, falls unconscious, and is plunged into a sleep with mere minutes to live.\n\nNarissa attempts to escape with Giselle's body but is confronted by Edward. Nathaniel, seeing that Narissa never cared about him, reveals her plot. Robert realizes that true love's kiss is the only force powerful enough to break the apple's curse. Edward's kiss fails to wake Giselle, and so he and Nancy prompt Robert to kiss her instead. When Robert kisses her, she awakens. Infuriated, Narissa transforms into a [[dragon]] and takes Robert hostage. Giselle takes Edward's sword and pursues Narissa to the top of the building as the dragon intends to drop Robert to his death. Pip comes to support Giselle and helps defeat Narissa by causing Narissa to fall to the streets below with his weight, and explode into dust. Robert almost falls as well, but Giselle manages to catch him, and they share another kiss on the roof.\n\nA happy new life unfolds for everyone, showing Edward and Nancy falling in love and marrying in Andalasia while Nathaniel, who stays in New York, and Pip, who returns to Andalasia, each write successful [[autobiographies]] based on their experiences in the real world. Giselle starts a very popular fashion design business and forms a happy family with Robert and Morgan in New York.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n|perrow = 3\n|total_width=340\n|align=right\n|image1=Amy Adams UK Nocturnal Animals Premiere (cropped).jpg\n|image2=Patrick Dempsey 2016.jpg\n|image3=James Marsden by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n|image4=Timothy Spall World Premiere The Party Berlinale 2017 02.jpg\n|image5=Idina Menzel Defense.gov Crop.png\n|image6=Susan Sarandon 3 by David Shankbone.jpg\n|footer='''Top row:''' [[Amy Adams]] (left), [[Patrick Dempsey]] and [[James Marsden]] play Giselle, Robert and Prince Edward.<br />'''Bottom row:''' [[Timothy Spall]] (left), [[Idina Menzel]] and [[Susan Sarandon]] play Nathaniel, Nancy and Queen Narissa.\n}}\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Giselle, a singing and dancing princess-to-be who ends up almost having her dream of meeting her prince a reality.

After the actors were hired, he was involved in making the final design of the movie, which made sure the animated characters look like their real-life counterparts.<ref name=\"THR-2007nov14\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n''Enchanted'' is the first feature-length Disney live-action/traditional animation hybrid since Disney's ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' in 1988, though the traditionally animated characters do not interact in the live-action environment in the same method as they did in ''Roger Rabbit''; however, there are some scenes where live-action characters share the screen with two-dimensional animated characters, for example, a live-action Nathaniel communicating with a cel-drawn Narissa, who is in a cooking pot. The film uses two [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]s; it begins in 2.35:1 when the [[Walt Disney Pictures]] logo and ''Enchanted'' storybook are shown, and then switches to a smaller 1.85:1 aspect ratio for the first animated sequence. The film switches back to 2.35:1 when it becomes live-action and never switches back, even for the remainder of the animated sequences. When this movie was aired on televised networks, the beginning of the movie (minus the logo and opening credits) was shown in the [[pillarbox]]ed 4:3 aspect ratio; the remainder of the movie was shown in the 16:9 aspect ratio when it becomes live-action. Lima oversaw the direction of both the live-action and animation sequences, which were being produced at the same time.<ref name=\"THR-2007nov14\"/> ''Enchanted'' took almost two years to complete. The animation took about a year to finish while the live-action scenes, which commenced filming on location in New York City during the summer of 2006 and were completed during the animation process, were shot in 72 days.<ref name=\"THR-2007nov14\"/>\n\n====Animation====\nOut of the film's 107 minutes of running time, ten of the approximately 13 minutes of animation are at the beginning of the film. Lima tried to \"cram every single piece of Disney iconic imagery\" that he could into the first ten minutes, which were done in [[Traditional animation|traditional cel animation]] (in contrast to computer-generated [[3-D animation]]) as a tribute to past Disney fairy tale films such as ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', and ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.<ref name=\"THR-2007nov14\"/> It was the first Disney film theatrically released in America to feature traditional cel animation since ''[[Pooh's Heffalump Movie]]'' (2005).

In the film's final sequence, in which Narissa climbs the [[Woolworth Building]] while clutching Robert in her claws, a [[greenscreen]] rig was built to hold Patrick Dempsey in order to film his face and movements.
