He encounters a group of men chasing a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]. An Irish [[bounty hunter]], Silas Selleck, arrives and shoots dead the leader. Jay employs the bounty hunter for protection.\n\nAt a trading post, unbeknownst to Jay, Silas sees a wanted poster offering a $2,000 bounty for Rose and her father. He plans to use Jay to get to the bounty. Another bounty hunter, Victor the Hawk, also takes notice of the poster. Inside, a Swedish couple attempts a robbery which results in the death of the owner and the husband. Jay intervenes and shoots the wife. Silas and Jay gather provisions and leave, abandoning the couple's children outside.\n\nIn the past, in Scotland, Rose is aware of Jay's affection, but only cares for him as a \"little brother\". Jay's uncle, Lord Cavendish, accidentally dies in an argument with John Ross, Rose's father. Rose and her father leave for America with the bounty on their heads.\n\nIn the present, Jay abandons Silas and proceeds alone, thinking him a \"brute\". He meets a travelling writer, Werner, who offers to accompany Jay. When Jay wakes the next morning, Werner has left, stealing Jay's horse and equipment. Silas finds Jay and returns Jay's horse and belongings, saying he ran into Werner while looking for Jay.\n\nThe pair meets Payne, the leader of Silas's old gang, which has taken in the Swedish children. Payne gives Silas and Jay [[absinthe]] in a failed attempt to gather information about Rose and her father's whereabouts. While they are asleep, Silas and Jay share a dream of Silas and Rose living together with a child. They awaken to find that Payne has stolen their weapons. Silas discloses the bounty to Jay. They evade Payne's gang in a forest, where Jay is injured by Native Americans.\n\nRose and her father live in a nearby prairie, protected by a Native American called Kotori. Victor, disguised as a priest, tracks them down and kills Rose's father. After reaching the prairie, Silas ties Jay to a tree to keep him from harm. Silas rushes to the house to warn Rose of Payne's gang but is wounded by Victor. Payne and his men murder Victor and assault the house.\n\nJay frees himself and runs to the house. After Kotori and most of Payne's gang are murdered, Rose realizes she has shot Jay in the confusion. While she comforts him, Payne enters the house, and Jay shoots him. As he dies, Silas tells Rose that Jay loved her \"with all his heart\". Silas stays with Rose and the Swedish children.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kodi Smit-McPhee]] as Jay Cavendish<ref name=\"Michael\" />\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as Silas Selleck<ref name=\"Michael\" />\n* [[Ben Mendelsohn]] as Payne<ref name=\"Michael\" />\n* [[Caren Pistorius]] as Rose Ross<ref name=\"ScreenDaily\" />\n* [[Rory McCann]] as John Ross<ref name=\"SlowWest\"/>\n* Edwin Wright as Victor the Hawk\n* Michael Whalley as The Kid\n* [[Andrew Robertt]] as Werner<ref name=\"SlowWest\"/>\n* [[Madeleine Sami]] as Marimacho\n* [[Brian Sergent]] as Peyote Joe\n* Bryan Michael Mills as The Minstrel\n* [[Kalani Queypo]] as Kotori\n\n==Production==\nOn 19 September 2013, it was announced that [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Kodi Smit-McPhee]], and [[Ben Mendelsohn]] had joined the cast of ''Slow West'', produced by [[Film4 Productions]].<ref name=\"Michael\">{{cite news |title=Michael Fassbender, Ben Mendelsohn & Kodi Smit-McPhee To Star In Western ''Slow West'' |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/michael-fassbender-ben-mendelsohn-kodi-smit-mcphee-to-star-in-western-slow-west-20130919 |accessdate=23 December 2013 |publisher=[[Indiewire]] |date=19 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] commenced on 21 October 2013 in New Zealand.
