The film stars Ritchie's then-wife [[Madonna]] and [[Adriano Giannini]] (the son of [[Giancarlo Giannini]], the original film's lead) with a supporting cast featuring [[Bruce Greenwood]], [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]] and [[Elizabeth Banks]].\n\nProduced by [[Matthew Vaughn]] and released theatrically by [[Screen Gems]], ''Swept Away'' was a [[box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing less than a tenth of its $10 million budget worldwide, and was negatively reviewed by critics, who have considered it to be [[List of films considered the worst#Swept Away (2002)|one of the worst films ever made]].\n\n==Plot summary==\nAmber Leighton is a wealthy, spoiled socialite wife of a millionaire who joins two other couples on a private cruise from [[Italy]] to [[Greece]]. Amber develops an instant and intense dislike for Giuseppe, a deckhand, and insults him mercilessly throughout the trip. During the trip, she insists on being taken out on a dinghy for a lark, overruling Giuseppe's warnings about an oncoming storm.\n\nDuring their dinghy trip, Amber berates Giuseppe incessantly, which only intensifies once they run out of gas. Through a series of mishaps, Amber damages the dinghy and they end up washing ashore on a deserted island.\n\nOn the island, Giuseppe gains the upper hand in their interactions due to his survival skills. As the roles reverse, Giuseppe becomes more dominant in his treatment of Amber, while she concurrently becomes more submissive and cowering. Their relationship evolves into intimacy.\n\nEventually, the two are rescued and return to their normal lives. Giuseppe attempts to reach out to Amber, to rekindle their relationship, but his messages receive no reply. Giuseppe believes that Amber has rejected him, and is despondent. However, it is revealed at the end that his letters have been intercepted by Amber's wealthy husband, who ensures that Amber never sees them or Giuseppe again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Madonna]] as Amber Leighton\n* [[Adriano Giannini]] as Giuseppe Esposito\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]] as Tony Leighton\n* [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]] as Marina\n* [[Elizabeth Banks]] as Debi\n* Michael Beattie as Todd\n* [[David Thornton (actor)|David Thornton]] as Michael\n\n==Production==\nThe film's working title was ''Love, Sex, Drugs and Money''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0291502/releaseinfo|title=Swept Away (2002) - Release Info|work=[[IMDb]]|access-date=3 May 2019}}</ref> and was filmed in [[Sardinia]] and [[Malta]] from 1 October 2001 until 9 November 2001 with security increased due to the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/2001/0930/top1.html|title=Security tightened for Madonna visit|last=Lindsay|first=David|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222012123/http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/2001/0930/top1.html|archive-date=22 February 2012|url-status=dead|access-date=15 April 2009}}</ref> Madonna had only finished her 2001 [[Drowned World Tour]] two weeks prior to filming.

[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/swept-away-2002 Swept Away review], retrieved 25 August 2014</ref> According to Ebert, despite Ritchie's relatively faithful adaptation, the original ''Swept Away'' was \"incomparably superior,\" and the remake's fatal flaw was the \"utterly missing\" vitality or emotional resonance of the main characters. Additionally, wrote Ebert, Madonna's character \"starts out so hateful that she can never really turn it around\" and gain any redemption or believable change. Similarly, [[A.O. Scott]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/reviews/movies|title=Movie Reviews|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 May 2020}}</ref> of ''The New York Times'' wrote, \"In her concerts, music videos and recordings, Madonna has often been a mesmerizing performer, but she is still not much of an actress. Striking a pose is not the same as embodying a person, and a role like this one requires the surrender of emotional control, something Madonna seems constitutionally unable to achieve.\" In his otherwise negative review of the film, [[Slant Magazine]] critic Ed Gonzalez said: \"Madonna gives her best performance since [[Abel Ferrara]] had her beaten to a pulp in his ''[[Dangerous Game (1993 film)|Dangerous Game]]''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/film-comment-selects-2006/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018144810/http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/film_review.asp?ID=505|url-status=dead|title=Film Comment Selects 2006|website = [[Slant Magazine]]|archive-date=18 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n\"The way critics take it out on me now is to have a go at anything me and Guy do together,\" Madonna remarked about the negative critical reaction. \"Everyone in England has slagged it off without having seen it. Isn't that beautiful? Don't you think that's absurd? But I think the knives were going to come out for Guy anyway, even if he hadn't ended up with me.
