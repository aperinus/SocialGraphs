The film was shot on location in [[Mexico]].\n\n==Plot==\nA nameless and conflicted [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[priest]] is a fugitive in an unnamed Latin American state where [[religion]] is outlawed. He tries to escape the country but his efforts are thwarted by a crazy Native and other circumstances. He returns to his village. Another fugitive, a murderous North American bandit dubbed \"El Gringo\", has already arrived in town. The crazy Native and the police troops soon follow. While Maria Dolores- a beautiful Indian woman, entertains the men, the priest escapes from the back. As the priest escapes the bandit \"El Gringo\" holds off the troops in a gun battle. He ends up wounded. The priest and Maria Dolores escape. In another town the priest seeks sanctuary but the crazy Native tracks him down and tells him that \"El Gringo\" is dying and he must return to give him last rites. He is dying but refuses the confession. Of course, it was a trap by the crazy Native and the head lieutenant, who has been hunting him. The priest is captured and sentenced to death, but forgives the informant for betraying him. The priest's execution by firing squad brings an outpouring of public grief and shows the authorities that it is impossible to stamp out religion as long as it exists in people's hearts and minds. Even the police lieutenant acknowledges his own faith.  In a church several residents pray for peace when there is a knock at the door.  A man stands at the door announcing that he is the new priest for the village.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Henry Fonda]] as Fugitive priest\n* [[Dolores del R\u00edo]] as Maria Dolores \n* [[Pedro Armend\u00e1riz]] as Police lieutenant\n* [[J. Carrol Naish]] as Police informer\n* [[Leo Carrillo]] as Chief of police\n* [[Ward Bond]] as James \"El Gringo\" Calvary\n* [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]] as Police sergeant\n* [[Rodolfo Acosta]] as Policeman (uncredited)\n\n== Production ==\nAn international co-production between The United States and Mexico. The ''Fugitive'' was filmed on location in [[Taxco de Alarc\u00f3n (municipality)|Taxco de Alarc\u00f3n]], [[Cholula, Puebla|Cholula]], [[Cuernavaca]], and the [[Estudios Churubusco|Churubusco Studios]] in Mexico City.  It was the first collaboration between RKO and Ford-Cooper's company [[Argosy Pictures]], the deal was for Argosy to produce three pictures that RKO should distribute and they would share the costs, and benefits fifty-fifty, but retaining creative control.\n\nWith the exception of two assistant directors and an editor, the entire crew was Mexican, about it Ford said it ran \"\"neck and neck with the best...in Hollywood.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/75798/The-Fugitive/notes.html|title=The Fugitive (1947) \u2013 Notes \u2013 TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}</ref>\n\nJohn Ford was helped by Mexican director [[Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez]] who served as an associate producer of the film. He introduced Ford to Dolores del R\u00edo, Pedro Armend\u00e1riz and cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa (all people Fern\u00e1ndez previously worked with). About Figueroa's work Ford said: \"It had a lot of damn good photography \u2013 with those black and white shadows, [...] We had a good cameraman, Gabriel Figueroa, and we'd ''wait'' for the light \u2013 instead of the way it is nowadays, where regardless of the light, you shoot.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/75798/The-Fugitive/articles.html|title=The Fugitive (1947) \u2013 Articles \u2013 TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies|access-date=2017-04-24}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nTag Gallagher has written an extended discussion of the film in his book, ''John Ford: The Man and His Films'' (1986). He summarizes ''The Fugitive'' and its place in Ford's career as follows: \"once in Mexico, Ford jettisoned most of the script and, giving leave to his fancy, made a highly abstract art film. ''The Fugitive'' lost considerable money, caused a rift between [writer Dudley] Nichols and Ford, and has posed problems even for Ford's most devoted followers. Only the director himself consistently defended it. 'I just enjoy looking at it.' 'To me, it was perfect.' And in terms of composition, lighting and editing, ''The Fugitive'' may be among the most enjoyable pictures.\"<ref name=Gallagher>{{cite book |title=John Ford: The Man and His Films |first=Tag |last=Gallagher |year=1986 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520063341 |page=234 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aSzmWVnKc-QC&pg=PA234 }} Gallagher has made an electronic version of his book freely available for download; see {{cite web |title=Tag Gallagher |url=http://home.sprynet.com/~tag/tag/ |access-date=2013-04-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113134235/http://home.sprynet.com/~tag/tag/ |archive-date=2013-01-13 }} Page numbers don't correspond exactly to the printed version.</ref>\n\n[[Bret Wood]] has written, \"Ford is best remembered today for his boisterous adventure films, such as ''The Quiet Man'' (1952), ''The Searchers'' (1956) or ''She Wore a Yellow Ribbon'' (1949); and for his crusty, unpretentious demeanor, often denying the existence of thematic subtext in his work and refusing to discuss his artistic intentions as a director. But ''The Fugitive'' belongs to an earlier, lesser known faction of his work, self-consciously 'arty' films that demonstrated his interests in German expressionism, English literature and religious ideology. Films such as ''The Informer'' (1935), ''The Prisoner of Shark Island'' (1936) or ''The Long Voyage Home'' (1940), remind us that beneath Ford's growling machismo were a sophisticated mind and a brilliant visual sense, even though Ford was later to deny both gifts ('I make Westerns' is how he typically summarized his career). ''The Fugitive'' is perhaps Ford's last great 'art film', a high-minded show of faith, a lovingly crafted paean to his own Catholicism.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Wood |first=Bret |title=The Fugitive |publisher=Turner Classic Movies |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/79835%7c0/The-Fugitive.html}}</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\nThe film gained the prize of the [[SIGNIS|International Catholic Organization for Cinema]] (OCIC) at the  [[Venice Film Festival]] in 1948. According to this jury, this was a film \"most capable of contributing to the revival of moral and spiritual values of humanity\". OCIC critic Johanes added to this that ''The Fugitive'' \"excelled in plastic perfection. On the other hand, its very excess of pictorial splendour was a fault of the John Ford-Figueroa production; The drama of the priest as related by Graham Greene lost in profundity what it gained in external splendour\".<ref name=\"autogenerated33\">Johanes, \"The Venice Film Festival\", p.33, in ''International Film Review'', Brussels, 1949.</ref> \"We all know the definition of this award \"for the production that has made the greatest contribution to the moral and spiritual betterment of humanity\". it differs from the other awards, when are normally given for artistic merit. Art for Art's sake is not the object, but rather art for the sake of man, the whole of man, heart and soul. Pious dullness is not the aim (...).<ref name=\"autogenerated33\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1947]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0039402|title=The Fugitive}}\n* {{AllMovie title|18833|The Fugitive}}\n* {{TCMDb title|75798|The Fugitive}}\n* {{AFI film|id=25173|title=The Fugitive}}\n\n{{John Ford}}\n{{Dudley Nichols}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fugitive, The}}\n[[Category:1947 films]]\n[[Category:1947 drama films]]\n[[Category:Mexican drama films]]\n[[Category:Mexican-American films]]\n[[Category:Mexican black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:1940s English-language films]]\n[[Category:English-language Mexican films]]\n[[Category:Films about Catholic priests]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Graham Greene]]\n[[Category:Films set in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Estudios Churubusco films]]\n[[Category:RKO Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Ford]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Dudley Nichols]]\n[[Category:Hispanic and Latino American drama films]]\n[[Category:1940s American films]]\n[[Category:1940s Mexican films]]"}]}}}}
