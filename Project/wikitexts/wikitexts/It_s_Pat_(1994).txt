The film was based on the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL'') character [[Pat (Saturday Night Live)|Pat]], created by Sweeney, an [[Androgyny|androgynous]] misfit whose sex is never revealed. [[Dave Foley]] plays Pat's partner Chris, and [[Charles Rocket]], another ''SNL'' alumnus, plays Pat's neighbor Kyle.\n\nThe film was released in only thirty-three theatres in three cities in the United States. ''It's Pat'' was critically panned by critics, and was largely bombed at the box-office, only grossed over $60,822 against its $8 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nPat Riley is a chubby, whiny, and obnoxious job-hopper of indeterminate gender who is searching for a steady foundation in life. Pat falls in love with Chris (whose sex is also unrevealed to the audience) and the two get engaged. Meanwhile, Pat's neighbor Kyle develops an unhealthy obsession with identifying Pat's sex, and begins stalking them. He sends a tape of Pat performing [[karaoke]] to a TV show called ''America's Creepiest People'', bringing them to the attention of the band [[Ween]], who feature Pat in one of their performances, playing the [[tuba]]. When Pat learns that Ween intended to only use them for one gig, Pat and Chris break up.{{Clarify|reason=non sequitur|date=May 2022}}\n\nKyle steals Pat's laptop containing their diary and tries to coerce them into revealing the computer's password, so he can access the files. When Pat only answers that it's a word in the [[dictionary attack|dictionary]], Kyle begins manually trying every word in a dictionary. He eventually succeeds with the password \"[[zythum]]\" (an Egyptian malt beer), and reads the diary, but doesn't find the answer to his question, and finally snaps.\n\nMeanwhile, a gang of thugs with the same goal begin harassing Pat, who becomes distraught over the thugs' androgynous nature.{{Clarify|reason=non sequitur|date=May 2022}} Pat complains to Kathy, a friend who is a [[Therapy|therapist]] and host of a radio talk show. When Pat gives acerbic reactions to call-in listeners, the station fires Kathy and replaces her with Pat.\n\nKyle calls into Pat's radio show saying he has Pat's laptop, and sets up a meeting at the [[Ripley's Believe It Or Not!#Museums|Ripley's Believe It or Not! Museum]] to retrieve it. Pat arrives to find Kyle dressed exactly like Pat. Kyle demands that Pat strip naked, but Pat runs off into a [[Ween]] concert. After Kyle corners them on a [[catwalk]], Pat falls. Their pants get torn off by a hook and they are lowered with their genitals exposed to the cheering concert  audience, but not to Kyle nor those watching the movie. Kyle is subsequently taken away by security guards. Pat then runs to see Chris, just as Chris is leaving on an ocean liner. In an [[epilogue]], Pat and Chris marry.\n\nDuring the end credits, Kathy is now hosting her radio show again and the first caller is Kyle, whose obsession with Pat has driven him to cross-dressing.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Julia Sweeney]] as [[Pat (Saturday Night Live)|Pat Riley]]\n* [[Dave Foley]] as Chris\n* [[Charles Rocket]] as Kyle Jacobsen\n* [[Kathy Griffin]] as Herself\n* Julie Hayden as Stacy Jacobsen\n* [[Timothy Stack]] as Doctor\n* [[Mary Scheer]] as Nurse\n* [[Beverly Leech]] as Mrs. Riley\n* [[Tim Meadows]] as KVIB-FM manager\n* [[Phil LaMarr]] as Stage manager\n* [[Larry Hankin]] as Postal supervisor\n* [[Kathy Najimy]] as Tippy\n* [[Jerry Tondo]] as Sushi chef\n* [[Mitch Pileggi]] as Concert Guard\n* [[Dean Ween|Dean]] and [[Gene Ween]] as themselves\n\n==Production==\nThe film was written by Sweeney, Jim Emerson (Sweeney's friend from their days with [[The Groundlings]]<ref name=\"seattle\" />), and Sweeney's former husband Stephen Hibbert.<ref name=\"seattle\">[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930131&slug=1682852 Pat's World &mdash; It's Funny Business, Hard Work And A Little Too Much Attention For Julia Sweeney], a January 1993 article from ''[[The Seattle Times]]''</ref> While at the Groundlings, Emerson suggested that the character Pat, at the time a \"character based on annoying co-workers who don't leave you alone\", be made androgynous.<ref name=\"seattle\" />\n\nThree months before the film's release, Sweeney commented on her initial reluctance to do a film based on Pat:<ref name=\"nyt\">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E4DC1130F93BA35756C0A962958260 Up From the Tube, but Then Down the Drain], a May 1994 article from ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>\n\n:I resisted it completely.
