It was written by [[William Goldman]], who based his screenplay on [[Ira Levin]]'s [[The Stepford Wives|1972 novel of the same name]]. The film stars [[Katharine Ross]] as a woman who relocates with her husband ([[Peter Masterson]]) and children from New York City to the Connecticut community of Stepford, where she comes to find the women live unwaveringly subservient lives to their husbands.\n\nFilmed in Connecticut in 1974, ''The Stepford Wives'' premiered theatrically in February 1975. It grossed $4 million at the U.S. box office, though it received mixed reviews from critics. Reaction from [[feminism|feminist]] activists was also divided at the time of its release; [[Betty Friedan]] dismissed it as a \"rip-off of the women's movement\" and discouraged women from seeing it, though others such as [[Gael Greene]] and [[Eleanor Perry]] defended the film. \n\n''The Stepford Wives'' has grown in stature as a [[cult film]] over the years, and the term ''Stepford'' or ''Stepford wife'' has become a popular science fiction concept. Several sequels to the film were made, as well as a [[The Stepford Wives (2004 film)|big-budget remake]] in 2004 that used the same title.\n\n==Plot==\nJoanna Eberhart is a young wife and aspiring photographer who moves with her husband Walter and their two daughters from Manhattan to Stepford, Connecticut. She finds that the women in town all look flawless and are obsessed with housework, but lack intellectual interests. The men all belong to the exclusionary Men's Association, which Walter joins to Joanna's dismay. Joanna is also bewildered by her neighbor Carol Van Sant's sexual submissiveness to her husband Ted, and her odd, repetitive behavior after a car accident.\n\nJoanna subsequently befriends Bobbie Markowe, with whom she finds common interests and shared ideas. Along with trophy wife Charmaine Wimperis, the three organize a women's liberation meeting, but the gathering is a failure when the other wives continually divert the discussion to cleaning products. Joanna is also unimpressed by the boorish Men's Association members, including the intimidating president Dale \u201cDiz\u201d Coba. Stealthily, the Men's Association collects information on Joanna including her picture, her voice, and other personal details. When Charmaine returns from a weekend trip with her husband as a devoted wife who has fired her maid and destroyed her tennis court, Joanna and Bobbie start investigating, with ever-increasing concern, the reason behind the submissive and bland behavior of the other wives. Their fear reaches its pinnacle when they discover that all the women were once strong, assertive, independent, and staunch advocates of [[Social liberalism|liberal social policies]], with word of an African American couple moving to Stepford. Bobbie speculates that industries in or nearby Stepford are contaminating the local water to make the women submissive, which is later disproven.\n\nBobbie and Joanna start house hunting in other towns. Later, Joanna wins a prestigious contract with a photo gallery. When she goes to tell Bobbie, Joanna is shocked to find that the former has abruptly become another clean conformist housewife with no intention of moving. She panics and visits a psychiatrist, to whom she voices her belief that the men in the town are in a conspiracy that involves altering the psyches of the women. The psychiatrist recommends that she leave town until she feels safe. After leaving the psychiatrist's office, Joanna returns home to pick up her children only to find out that her children are missing and Walter is evasive about their whereabouts. The two get in a physical scuffle when she refuses her husband\u2019s demands to lie down in her bed. Joanna locks herself in the bedroom, then sneaks out to Bobbie's house after Walter leaves her alone, but grows frustrated when Bobbie refuses to engage with her in a meaningful way. Desperate and disturbed, Joanna cuts her hand before stabbing Bobbie with a kitchen knife. Bobbie does not bleed, but instead malfunctions, revealing that the real Bobbie has been replaced by a [[robot]].\n\nJoanna later returns home and bludgeons Walter with a firepoker, demanding to know where their children were taken. He tells Joanna that the kids are at the Men's Association, after which Walter loses consciousness. Despite sensing that she will be the latest victim, Joanna sneaks into the mansion that houses the Men's Association, in hopes of finding her children. However, she is confronted by Coba, the operation\u2019s mastermind. Coba tells Joanna that her children are really with Charmaine. He remotely locks the front door and asks her if she desires a flawless husband, explaining that the men of Stepford replace their wives because they \"can\", and that it's \"perfect\" for both the husband and the wife. Dale then takes the poker away from her, at which point she screams and flees, eventually coming upon her own active but unfinished robot replica. Joanna is shocked into near paralysis when she witnesses its black, empty eyes. The Joanna-replica smiles as it brandishes a nylon stocking and calmly approaches Joanna to strangle her as Dale looks on.\n\nSome time later, the artificial Joanna placidly peruses the local supermarket amongst the other glamorously dressed wives. As they make their way through the store, they each vacantly greet one another. Meanwhile, in the same store, an African American couple argues with each other. During the end credits, photographs show a smiling Walter driving the family car and picking up his new \"Stepford Wife\" from the supermarket with their children in the backseat.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Katharine Ross]] as Joanna Eberhart\n* [[Paula Prentiss]] as Bobbie Markowe\n* [[Peter Masterson]] as Walter Eberhart\n* [[Nanette Newman]] as Carol van Sant\n* [[Tina Louise]] as Charmaine Wimperis\n* Carol Rossen as Dr. Fancher\n* [[William Prince (actor)|William Prince]] as Ike Mazzard\n* [[Patrick O'Neal (actor)|Patrick O'Neal]] as Dale \"Diz\" Coba\n* [[Carole Mallory]] as Kit Sundersen\n* Toni Reid as Marie Axhelm\n* [[Judith Baldwin]] as Patricia Cornell\n* Barbara Rucker as Mary Ann Stavros\n* [[George Coe]] as Claude Axhelm\n* [[Franklin Cover]] as Ed Wimperis\n* [[Robert Fields]] as Raymond Chandler\n* [[Michael Higgins (actor)|Michael Higgins]] as Frank Cornell\n* [[Josef Sommer]] as Ted van Sant\n* [[Remak Ramsay]] as Mr. Atkinson\n* [[Mary Stuart Masterson]] as Kim Eberhart\n* Ronny Sullivan as Amy Eberhart\n* [[Tom Spratley]] as Charlie the Doorman\n}}\n\n==Analysis==\nFilm scholar [[John Kenneth Muir]] interprets ''The Stepford Wives'' as \"a film essay about what it means to be part of an unspoken 'underclass.'\"{{sfn|Muir|2012|p=373}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nProducer Edgar Scherick recruited English director [[Bryan Forbes]] to direct the film.<ref name=ew/>  [[Brian De Palma]] was initially going to direct<ref>{{cite web|last=Carlson|first=Sean|title= Stepford Wives, The|date=July 24, 2001|website=IGN|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/07/24/stepford-wives-the?amp=1|accessdate=June 14, 2022}}</ref> but William Goldman didn\u2019t want him to.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Gonzalez|first=Ed|title= VIDEODVD Review: Bryan Forbes's The Stepford Wives on Paramount Home Video|date=June 10, 2004|magazine=Slant Magazine|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/the-stepford-wives-dvd/amp/|accessdate=June 14, 2022}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nFor the lead role of Joanna Eberhart, Forbes initially met with [[Diane Keaton]], whom he said turned it down because her analyst did not like the script.{{sfn|Forbes|1993|p=27}} [[Jean Seberg]] declined the part;<ref name=ew/> [[Tuesday Weld]] initially accepted but cancelled before filming began.<ref name=wolf>{{cite news|title=Creating Horror in Connecticut Sunlight|author=Wolf, William|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=August 11, 1974|page=Q30}}</ref> The part eventually went to [[Katharine Ross]].\n\n[[Joanna Cassidy]] was cast as Joanna's friend and ally Bobbie<ref name=afi>{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/55277|work=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]]|location=Los Angeles, California|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102070950/https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/55277|archive-date=January 2, 2020|title=The Stepford Wives}}</ref> but was fired after a few weeks of production and replaced by [[Paula Prentiss]].<ref name=afi/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjF7SD3S-tE |title=\"The Stepford Life\" mini-documentary on 1975 \"Stepford Wives\" film |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=January 24, 2021 |archive-date=January 31, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210131104629/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjF7SD3S-tE |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Mary Stuart Masterson]] (daughter of Peter Masterson), [[Dee Wallace]] and [[Franklin Cover]] appear in supporting roles.

With the exception of the stormy night finale, it is almost over-saturated to emphasize bright lights and cheerful-looking settings.\n\nTension developed between Forbes and screenwriter Goldman over the casting of Nanette Newman (Forbes' wife) as one of the wives. Goldman felt that the 40 year old Newman's appearance did not match the young provocatively-dressed model-like women he'd scripted for. Forbes responded by instituting contemporary prairie-style dress, complete with frilly aprons, for all the wives. Goldman was also unhappy with re-writes by Forbes - in particular, the ending<ref>''The Stepford Wives: Behind the Scenes'' documentary</ref> - which Nanette Newman claimed Forbes had deliberately filmed \"in an unreal way, so they were almost like a ballet moving in and out, up and down the aisle.\"<ref name=Coggan>{{cite magazine|author=Coggan, Devan|url=https://ew.com/movies/2017/10/23/the-stepford-wives-1975-history/|title=The Stepford Wives: Inside the making of the 1975 feminist horror classic|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2017-10-23|access-date=2020-04-05|archive-date=August 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828002311/https://ew.com/movies/2017/10/23/the-stepford-wives-1975-history/|url-status=live}}</ref> Additional stresses were caused when\nactor [[Peter Masterson]] secretly called his friend Goldman for input on scenes.
