His father is relatively content to stay, while his mother copes by trying to cobble together [[Atomic (cocktail)|atomic era cocktails]]. When Adam has to come out of the shelter to get more supplies, his old-fashioned attitudes and manners make him a hit with everyone he meets, and attracts the attentions of Eve Rustikov.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics and was a box office disappointment.\n\n==Plot==\nEccentric American scientist Dr. Calvin Webber believes [[nuclear war]] with the [[Soviet Union]] is imminent, and builds a secret [[fallout shelter]] beneath his backyard in 1962. Alarmed by the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], Calvin takes his pregnant wife Helen into the shelter. An unexpected [[mechanical failure]] aboard an [[F-86 Sabre]] causes the aircraft to lose control. The pilot [[ejection seat|ejects]] from the plane, which proceeds to crash into the house; Calvin assumes the worst and activates the shelter\u2019s time-locks for 35 years. With the house completely destroyed by the crash, the Webbers' neighbors and authorities assume they were killed and their property is left abandoned.\n\nHelen gives birth to Adam, who is immersed in culture up to 1962, including TV reruns of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' and ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' and listening to pop standards by [[Perry Como]] and [[Dean Martin]]. A diner, which opens in 1965, is built above the shelter, where Melker works for Mom as a [[soda jerk]]. The diner becomes a pizzeria, then a punk club named Purgatory as the suburban neighborhood deteriorates throughout the decades into an inner city [[ghetto]]. Mom eventually gives the club to Melker; the establishment closes and by 1995, he is an alcoholic living in its condemned remains.\n\nWhen the shelter unlocks in 1997, Calvin mistakes the now-blighted neighborhood where his home once was for a post-apocalyptic wasteland of irradiated [[Mutants in fiction|mutants]] and decides the family must stay underground. With supplies running out and Calvin falling ill, Adam leaves the shelter for the first time. He meets Melker, who encountered Calvin the previous night, bursting through the floor in his radiation suit. Melker now worships Calvin and the elevator. Marveling at the outside world, Adam purchases supplies, but cannot remember his way back to the pub.\n\nTrying to sell his father's classic baseball cards at a hobby shop, Adam meets Eve Rustikov. She stops the store owner from cheating Adam and is fired. Eve drives Adam to a [[Holiday Inn]] in exchange for a rare card, but returns the next morning out of guilt. Adam asks her to help purchase supplies. Unaware of the value of money, Adam agrees to her request for $1,000 a week. He also asks Eve to help him find a wife from [[Pasadena, California]], per his mother's advice, who is \"not a mutant\". Adam meets Eve's gay housemate and best friend Troy, who provides him with advice and a fashion makeover.\n \nEve and Troy take Adam to a 1940s swing-style nightclub to find him a wife. Adam attracts the attention of several women, including Eve's nemesis Sophie. Jealous, Eve reconnects with her ex-boyfriend Cliff, who goads Adam into an altercation, relenting when Adam demonstrates his boxing skills, having trained every day with his father. Eve leaves. Troy returns home and explains Adam went home with Sophie. Adam returns, explaining that he politely rejected Sophie's advances, as he could only think about Eve. He and Eve kiss, but when Adam admits the truth about his past and his desire to take her to be his wife \"underground\", she asks him to leave.\n\nFinding the pub, where Melker preaches to a full congregation, Adam returns to Eve's house, where she is waiting with Dr. Nina Aron and her assistant to have him committed. Initially cooperating, Adam escapes asking Eve and Troy to collect his things and pay his hotel bill. In his hotel room, Troy and Eve find toiletries and clothing from the 1960s and absurdly valuable [[stock certificate]]s in companies like [[IBM]] (which Calvin had written off as \"worthless\"), and deduce that Adam is not crazy and was telling the truth the whole time.\n\nAs Melker and his cult load supplies into the shelter, Calvin prepares to seal his family inside again. Eve spots Adam outside the pub; they embrace, and Adam takes her to meet his parents. Impressed with Eve, Calvin and Helen agree to set the shelter's locks for two months while Adam and Eve make arrangements.\n\nDuring this time, Adam and Eve sell the stocks to build his parents a new home in the country, identical to their house that was destroyed, and purchase and restore a red 1960 [[Cadillac automobile|Cadillac]] convertible. They help Melker rebuild the pub into a '50s-themed nightclub after convincing him that Adam is not God.\n\nAdam reveals there was never an atomic war, the \"bomb\" was not a bomb and instead was a plane that had crashed into their house,  [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|and that the Soviet Union collapsed peacefully]], ending the [[Cold War]]. Unconvinced, Calvin plans to build a new fallout shelter as Eve watches while playing with her engagement ring.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Brendan Fraser]] as Adam Webber\n** Hayden Tank as Adam Webber (age {{frac|3|1|2}})\n** Ryan Sparks as Adam Webber (age 8)\n** [[Douglas Smith (actor)|Douglas Smith]] as Adam Webber (age 11)\n* [[Alicia Silverstone]] as Eve Rustikov\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Calvin Webber\n* [[Sissy Spacek]] as Helen Webber\n* [[Dave Foley]] as Troy\n* [[Joey Slotnick]] as Melker (credited as Soda Jerk in the film)\n* [[Dale Raoul]] as Mom\n* [[Rex Linn]] as Dave\n* Bill Gratton as Eve's Boss\n* [[Nathan Fillion]] as Cliff\n* [[Jenifer Lewis]] as Dr. Nina Aron\n* [[Hugh Wilson (director)|Hugh Wilson]] as Levy\n* Cynthia Mace as Betty\n* Harry S.
