It was directed by [[Kevin Reynolds (director)|Kevin Reynolds]] and stars [[Kevin Costner]] as Robin Hood, [[Morgan Freeman]] as Azeem, [[Christian Slater]] as [[Will Scarlett]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]] as [[Maid Marian|Marian]], and [[Alan Rickman]] as the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]]. The screenplay was written by [[Pen Densham]] and [[John Watson (film producer)|John Watson]].\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Freeman's and Rickman's performances and the music, but criticized Costner's performance, the screenplay, and the overall execution. Nevertheless, it was a box office success, grossing more than $390&nbsp;million worldwide, making it the [[1991 in film#Highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film of 1991]]. Rickman received the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role]] for his performance as George, [[Sheriff of Nottingham]]. The theme song \"[[(Everything I Do) I Do It for You]]\" by [[Bryan Adams]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]], and it won the [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/1992-grammy-awards.html |url-status=unfit |title=1992 Grammy Awards |publisher=metrolyrics.com | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090209091440/http://www.metrolyrics.com/1992-grammy-awards.html| archive-date= February 9, 2009 |access-date=January 1, 2021 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1194, at the end of the [[Third Crusade]], [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart, King of England]] is visiting [[Kingdom of France|France]]. This leaves the cruel Sheriff of Nottingham\u2014aided by his cousin [[Guy of Gisbourne]], the evil [[Witchcraft|witch]] Mortianna, and the corrupt [[Bishop of Hereford (Robin Hood)|Bishop of Hereford]]\u2014to rule the land. The Lord of Locksley Castle is killed by the Sheriff's men for remaining loyal to King Richard and refusing to join their gang. His lost son, [[Robin Hood|Robin]] of [[Loxley, South Yorkshire|Locksley]], had followed the king's [[Crusades|Crusade]] and spent five years in an [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] prison in [[Jerusalem]].\n\nRobin and his [[comrade]], Peter Dubois, break out of prison, saving the life of a [[Moors|Moor]], named Azeem. Mortally-wounded, Peter makes Robin swear to protect his sister, [[Maid Marian|Marian]], and distracts the pursuers so Robin can escape. Robin returns to [[Kingdom of England|England]] with Azeem, who has vowed to accompany him until his life-debt is repaid. After a run-in with Gisbourne, Robin goes home and finds his father's rotted corpse on display in the ruined castle. Duncan, an old family [[domestic worker|retainer]] blinded by Gisbourne, tells him how his father was falsely accused of devil worship. The Sheriff consults Mortianna, who foresees King Richard's return and panics that Robin and Azeem \"will be our deaths\".\n\nRobin tells his childhood friend Marian of her brother Peter's death and his promise, but Marian sees little need for his protection and is determined to stay and look after the people on her [[demesne]]. They flee the Sheriff's forces to hide in [[Sherwood Forest]], and encounter an outlaw band also in hiding. Their leader, [[Little John]], challenges Robin to a duel which Robin wins after some difficulty. [[Will Scarlet]], one of the bandits, holds a grudge against Robin and protests when Robin assumes command of the outlaws. Robin shapes the group into a formidable force against Nottingham. They rob rich folk passing through the [[Royal forest|forest]] and distribute the stolen wealth and food among the poor. [[Friar Tuck]] joins them once he understands their cause. Marian offers Robin any aid she can, and they begin to fall in love.\n\nRobin's successes infuriate the Sheriff, who worsens his abuse of the public, but which increases their support for Robin. The Sheriff kills Gisbourne for failing to stop the outlaws. Seeking Mortiana's advice once more, she recommends he recruit [[Celts|Celtic]] warriors. The Bishop betrays Marian after she gives him a message warning King Richard of Nottingham's plots, and she is taken prisoner. Duncan rides to Sherwood, but is followed. The Sheriff storms and burns the outlaws' hideout, capturing many with Robin presumed dead. To consolidate his power and claim the throne, the Sheriff proposes marriage to Marian (who is Richard's cousin), claiming that, if she accepts, he will spare the lives of the woodsmen and their families, specifically the children caught during the attack. As well as her Lady-in-waiting. Marian reluctantly agrees, but the captured ringleaders, according to Nottingham are to be hanged anyway as part of the wedding celebration.\n\nWill bargains with the Sheriff that he will find out if Robin is alive and kill him. Will informs Robin, Azeem, John, and a few other survivors of the Sheriff's plans, but does not trust Robin. Will reveals that the reason for his animosity toward Robin is because he is actually Robin's half-brother; after Robin's mother died, his father had taken comfort with Will's mother, a peasant woman. Robin's anger over what he saw as a betrayal of his mother's memory caused his father to leave Will's mother, leaving Will fatherless. Robin is overjoyed to learn that he has a brother, and they reconcile.\n\nOn the wedding day, Robin and his men infiltrate Nottingham Castle and free the prisoners. Azeem inspires the Nottingham peasants to revolt, forcing the Sheriff to retreat with Marian into his keep. The Bishop performs the marriage, and the Sheriff is about to consummate it when Robin bursts in. Friar Tuck finds the Bishop fleeing with bags of gold, and burdens him with additional treasure before [[Defenestration|defenestrating]] him. In a fierce fight Robin kills the Sherif and Azeem kills Mortianna in defense of Robin, fulfilling his life-debt leaving Robin and Marian to profess their love for one another.\n\nLater at Robin and Marion's wedding in Sherwood, just before Friar Tuck pronounces them man and wife they are briefly interrupted by the return of King Richard, who gives the bride away and thanks Robin for saving his throne.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as [[Robin of Locksley]]<ref>{{cite news |title= FILM; Hollywood's Superhunk Heads for Nottingham |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date=1991-06-09 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/09/movies/film-hollywood-s-superhunk-heads-for-nottingham.html |first=Maureen |last=Dowd |access-date=2021-09-01 }}</ref>\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Azeem Edin Bashir Al Bakir\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]] as [[Maid Marian|Lady Marian]]\n* [[Christian Slater]] as [[Will Scarlett]]\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]]<ref>{{cite news|title= Robin Hood' and the uncertain science of hype|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1991-06-09|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1991-06-09/entertainment/ca-671_1_robin-hood|access-date=2010-10-02|first=Joe|last=Leydon}}</ref>\n* [[Geraldine McEwan]] as Mortianna\n* [[Mike McShane|Michael McShane]] as [[Friar Tuck]]\n* [[Brian Blessed]] as Lord Locksley\n* [[Michael Wincott]] as [[Guy of Gisborne]]\n* [[Nick Brimble]] as [[Little John]]\n* [[Harold Innocent]] as [[the Bishop of Hereford]]\n* [[Walter Sparrow]] as Duncan\n* [[Daniel Newman (British actor)|Daniel Newman]] as Wulf\n* [[Daniel Peacock]] as Bull\n* [[Jack Wild]] as Much\n* Soo Drouet as Fanny\n* Liam Halligan as Peter Dubois\n* [[Michael Goldie]] as Kenneth\n* [[Susannah Corbett]] as Lady in Coach\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[Richard I of England|King Richard]]<ref name=\"medievalisms\">{{cite book |last1=Pugh |first1=Tison |editor1-last=Coyne Kelly |editor1-first=Kathleen |editor2-last=Pugh |editor2-first=Tison |title=Queer movie medievalisms |date=2009 |publisher=Ashgate |location=Farnham |isbn=978-0-7546-7592-1 |page=161 |chapter=8: Sean Connery's Star Persona and the Queer Middle Ages}}</ref> (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:CRW 2684.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sycamore Gap Tree]] at a section of [[Hadrian's Wall]] between two crests just east of Milecastle 39, locally known as the \"Robin Hood Tree\"]]\n\n===Development===\nIn August 1989, British writer-producer [[Pen Densham]] broke with the traditional account of Robin Hood as a devil-may-care adventurer, best embodied by [[Errol Flynn]] in ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' in 1938. He instead reimagined Robin as a rich kid transformed into a socially conscious rebel by imprisonment in [[Jerusalem]] during the [[Crusades]]. He wrote a 92-page outline, which was then rewritten as a screenplay by his producing partner, John Watson. On February 14, 1990, [[Morgan Creek Entertainment|Morgan Creek]], the small production company of ''[[Young Guns (film)|Young Guns]]'' (1988) and ''[[Major League (film)|Major League]]'' (1989), saw \"gold on the page\" and immediately funded the film. Watson scouted filming locations in the United Kingdom, setting September 3 as the filming deadline in aggressive competition against other potential ''Robin Hood'' remakes from [[Twentieth Century Fox]] (Morgan Creek's former distribution partner) and [[Tri-Star Pictures]].<ref name=\"Behind\"/>\n\n[[Kevin Reynolds (director)|Kevin Reynolds]] had directed [[Kevin Costner]] extensively in the past, including the challenging buffalo hunt scene of ''Dances with Wolves''. Reynolds said: \"I'd done two pictures that hadn't made a dime, so I kind of knew [the studio] wanted me [for ''Robin Hood''] because of my connections with Kevin.\" Indeed, Costner had already rejected the script until hearing that Reynolds was directing: \"I felt Kevin was such a good filmmaker I would do it\".<ref name=\"Behind\"/>\n\nReynolds said, \"what I did not want to do was ''[[Indiana Jones]]''. That has been done already\". Costner wanted an accent but Reynolds thought it would distract audiences, and their indecision resulted in a drastically uneven delivery between each scene. ''EW'' reported, \"Even before it was finished, Costner was the subject of embarrassing rumors that his performance was too laid-back and his accent more LA than UK.\"<ref name=\"Behind\">{{cite news | newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=June 21, 1991 | first=Garth | last=Pearce | title=Behind-the-scenes trouble during \"Robin Hood\" | url=https://ew.com/article/1991/06/21/behind-scenes-trouble-during-robin-hood/ | access-date=July 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nFor the role of King Richard, comedian [[John Cleese]] was proposed but [[Sean Connery]] was selected at the passionate behest of Costner and Densham. Fearing that the sudden cameo of a notorious comedic icon would destroy the drama, Densham recalls, \"I so wanted to not have the John Cleese that I said, 'Would you give me Sean Connery? We can't give him a credit because you can't have the audience waiting for the whole movie to see him \u2014 but he only has to work one day.\" His requested $1 million fee was negotiated down to $250,000 and paid to a hospital in Connery's native [[Scotland]] as charitable compromise for making film history with the already over-budget project.<ref name=\"Cleese\">{{cite news | title='Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves' Nearly Featured John Cleese as King Richard | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=June 14, 2021 | first=Ryan | last=Parker | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/robin-hood-prince-of-thieves-kevin-costner-john-cleese-sean-connery-king-richard-1234967484/ | access-date=August 29, 2021}}</ref><ref name=\"SC\">{{cite book | title=Sean Connery: from 007 to Hollywood Icon | first=Andrew | last=Yule | date=1993 | url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Sean_Connery/-8g-UpHJoFwC?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=%22fee%20for%20a%20one-day%20appearance%22 | page=415 | isbn=9781558177420 | access-date=August 29, 2021}}</ref><ref name=\"medievalisms\"/>\n\nIn 2015, Alan Rickman admitted he had secretly asked his scriptwriter friends [[Ruby Wax]] and [[Peter Barnes (playwright)|Peter Barnes]] to punch up the script: \"Will you have a look at this script because it's terrible, and I need some good lines.\" Reynolds added their lines.<ref>{{cite news |date=17 April 2015 |last1=Malvern |first1=Jack |title=Rickman rewrites rules on playing the bad guy |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rickman-rewrites-rules-on-playing-the-bad-guy-nrkqbcw66dl |website=[[The Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210614183015/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rickman-rewrites-rules-on-playing-the-bad-guy-nrkqbcw66dl |archive-date=2021-06-14 |url-status=live |url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nCostner's explosive career gave him only a few days between the long-term epic projects of ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'', ''Robin Hood'', and ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]''. This project's timeframe was compressed by the cold seasons in England and by competition with other possible ''Robin Hood'' films, giving Reynolds only 10 weeks for preproduction and little time for planning, rehearsal, or revision. Costner said, \"It's very dangerous to be [working] so fast. We are relying on the weather, and every time the weather turns against us we could get behind. When that happens there is always the feeling that certain people want to do something about it to shorten the filming time. That is not always the cure.\" Reynolds said, \"Are things going as planned? Ha! You always start with a picture in your mind, and it is a compromise all the way from there. We have been struggling from Day One. We are trying to finish by Christmas, and the days are getting shorter. It's horrible.\" On the first day of filming, the suddenly changing weather caused jet traffic to be diverted from London's [[Heathrow Airport]] {{convert|10|mi}} away, and roar over the filming location at the Burnham Beeches.<ref name=\"Behind\"/>\n\nPrincipal exteriors were shot on location in the [[United Kingdom]].
