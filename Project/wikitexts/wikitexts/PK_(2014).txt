It was later rewritten with a different angle and tone. During production, the film was initially titled ''Talli'' and later ''Ek Tha Talli'' before being changed to ''PK'' as the latter title was found to be too similar to ''[[Ek Tha Tiger]]'' (2012). The film's soundtrack was composed by [[Shantanu Moitra]], [[Ajay\u2013Atul]] and [[Ankit Tiwari]] with lyrics written by [[Swanand Kirkire]], Amitabh Varma and Manoj Muntashir. [[UTV Motion Pictures]] acquired the distribution rights of the film.

Upon release, it received positive reviews, with praise directed towards Khan's performance and the film's humour. The film received 8 nominations at the [[60th Filmfare Awards]], winning two. Additionally, it won five [[Producers Guild Film Awards]], and two [[Screen Awards]]. ''PK'' garnered the [[Telstra People's Choice Award]] at the [[Indian Film Festival of Melbourne]]. Produced on a budget of {{INR}}850&nbsp;million (approx. $12&nbsp;million), ''PK'' was the first Indian film to gross more than {{INR|link=yes}}7&nbsp;billion and [[United States dollar|US$]]100&nbsp;million worldwide. At the time of its release, it emerged as the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|highest-grossing Indian film of all time]]. The film's final worldwide gross was {{INR|link=yes}}854{{nbsp}}[[crore]] (US$140{{nbsp}}million). It currently stands as the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|7th highest grossing Indian film of all time.]] and [[List of highest-grossing films in India|7th highest-grossing film in India]].\n\n== Plot ==\nAn android alien lands on Earth naked on a research mission in [[Rajasthan]] but is stranded when the remote control for his spaceship is stolen. He manages to get the thief's cassette recorder. On the same day in [[Belgium]], an Indian woman, Jagat Janani Sahni alias Jaggu, meets a Pakistani, Sarfaraz Yousuf, and falls in love with him. Jaggu's father objects to their relationship, citing difference in their religions. He consults [[Godman (India)|godman]] Tapasvi Maharaj who predicts that Sarfaraz will betray Jaggu. Determined to prove them wrong, Jaggu asks Sarfaraz to marry her. At the wedding, she is heartbroken when she receives an unsigned letter, believing it is from Sarfaraz, calling off the wedding due to cultural differences.\n\nJaggu returns to India and becomes a news reporter. She meets the alien and is intrigued to see him distribute leaflets about the \"missing\" God. She earns his trust by rescuing him when he attempts to take money from a temple's collection box as a refund on God's broken promises. The alien tells her that he is an 'astronaut' from another planet. His people know nothing about dressing, religion, or verbal communication; they transfer ideas by holding hands.\n\nA flashback shows how, after being accidentally hit by a truck, the alien is befriended by bandmaster Bhairon Singh, who takes him along with his troop. Bhairon takes him to a [[brothel]], where the alien holds a prostitute Phuljhadiya's hand for six hours and thus learns the [[Bhojpuri language]]. The alien begins speaking, and after learning of the whole scenario, Bhairon tells him that his thief may be in [[Delhi]]. The alien leaves for Delhi. Due to his strange behaviour, people assume he is drunk and call him \"peekay\" or \"PK\" (Hindi for drunk); the alien adopts PK as a name (his people have no language and thus no names). People tell PK that only \"God\" can help him find his remote. He sincerely practices Indian religions, including Hinduism, Sikhism, Christianity and Islam, attempting to find \"God\", to no avail. He later discovers that Tapasvi has his remote, who claims it was a gift from God and refuses to return it. Jaggu promises PK that she will recover his remote and he can go back home.\n\nPK conjectures, as Jaggu plays a prank on an unknown caller, that Tapasvi and other godmen must be dialling a \"wrong number\" to communicate with God and are advising the public to engage in meaningless rituals. Jaggu encourages the public to expose [[Pious fraud|fraudulent godmen]] by sending their videos to her news channel. This \"wrong number\" campaign turns into a popular mass movement, to the dismay of Tapasvi. Meanwhile, Bhairon finds the thief and contacts PK, telling him that he sold his remote to Tapasvi. PK realises that Tapasvi was a fraud all along and that it was not a \"wrong number\". Bhairon brings the thief to Delhi, but both die in a terrorist attack.\n\nTapasvi decides to confront PK on-air. Tapasvi asks PK what the \"right number\" is. PK says that \"God created us all\" is the only concept people should believe in and that the other \"duplicate Gods\" are artificial. Tapasvi argues, saying that PK is trying to take people away from their Gods and that they will not stand for their Gods being taken away. He claims he has a direct connection to God and refers to his prediction of Sarfaraz's betrayal to try to prove that Muslims are liars. PK, having absorbed Jaggu's memories earlier, realises that Sarfaraz did not write the letter to Jaggu.\n\nJaggu contacts the [[List of diplomatic missions of Pakistan#Europe|Pakistani Embassy]] in Belgium where Sarfaraz worked part-time. The embassy receptionist tells her that Sarfaraz has been annoying the embassy officials by repeatedly asking if they received a call from Delhi, implying that he still loves Jaggu. That day, Sarfaraz found the same letter and thought it was from Jaggu, and did not call her as he understood she was under familial pressure. Jaggu and Sarfaraz reconnect, and Tapasvi is forced by Jaggu's father to return PK's remote.\n\nMeanwhile, PK has fallen in love with Jaggu but refrains from telling her because she loves Sarfaraz. Having filled multiple audio tapes with her voice alone, he takes two suitcases full of tapes and extra batteries when leaving for home. He lies to Jaggu that the tapes contain a variety of Earthly noises which he will miss, such as crows and car horns. Jaggu realises his love for her by seeing the note he wrote for her earlier but does not directly confront him about it. PK does not even look back while going as he doesn't want her to see him in tears which will give away his love for her. After his departure, Jaggu publishes a book about him, with Sarfaraz and her family assisting.\n\nOne year later, PK returns to Earth on a new research mission on human nature with more members of his species.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n[[File:Aamir Khan at 92.7 BIG FM to promote Satyamev Jayate 06.jpg|thumb|[[Aamir Khan]] at the Radio Station 92.7's studio in [[Mumbai]]]]\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Aamir Khan]] as PK ({{literally|PeeKay ([[drunk]])}}), a [[humanoid alien]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-revealed-aamir-khan-s-real-name-in-pk-2041864/amp|title=Revealed: Aamir Khan's real name in 'PK'|publisher=DNA|date=7 December 2014 |access-date=22 April 2022}}</ref>\n* [[Anushka Sharma]] as Jagat \"Jaggu\" Janani Sahni, a news reporter & Sarfaraz's girlfriend\n* [[Sushant Singh Rajput]] as Sarfaraz Yousuf, Jaggu's boyfriend\n* [[Boman Irani]] as Cherry Bajwa, Jaggu's boss\n* [[Saurabh Shukla]] as Godman Tapasvi Maharaj\n* [[Sanjay Dutt]] as Bhairon \"Bhaia\" Singh, PK's friend\n* [[Parikshit Sahni]] as Jayprakash Sahni, Jaggu's father\n* [[Amardeep Jha]] as Mrs. Sahni, Jaggu's mother\n* [[Ram Sethi]] as the Old Man in [[Belgium]] who betrayed Sarfaraz & Jaggu\n* [[Sai Gundewar]] as [[Belgium]] Show Ticket Seller\n* [[Rohitash Gaud]] as [[Delhi Police|Mr. Pandey]], a [[police inspector]]\n* [[Ranbir Kapoor]] in a [[special appearance]] as a fellow alien from PK's home planet\n* [[Reema Debnath]] as Phuljhadiya, the prostitute\n* Sachin Parikh as Tapasvi's manager\n*[[Arun Bali]] as the Old Sikh man in restaurant who wants money from Pk\n*[[Kamini Kaushal]] as the wife of Old Sikh man in restaurant\n* Michael Pekala as bystander in train station<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/2036309/TV-actor-to-play-cop-in-Aamirs-PK |title=TV actor to play cop in Aamir's PK |publisher=Bollywood Hungama |date=14 August 2013 |access-date=7 February 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Rukhsaar Rehman]] as the Receptionist at Pakistan Embassy, Belgium\n* [[Plabita Borthakur]] as Jaggu's sister<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/the-right-breaks/article6799237.ece |title=The right breaks |first=Y.
