It is the sequel to the 2006 film ''[[Crank (film)|Crank]]'', and stars [[Jason Statham]], [[Amy Smart]], [[Clifton Collins Jr.]], [[Efren Ramirez]], [[Bai Ling]], [[David Carradine]], and [[Dwight Yoakam]]. The story follows ex-hitman Chev Chelios, who, shortly after surviving a deadly fall on the streets of Los Angeles, is kidnapped and has his heart stolen by Chinese gangsters who replace it with an artificial organ designed to keep him alive for an hour. Chev then sets out to find his heart while keeping himself electrically charged to stay alive. The film also features several cameo appearances of celebrities from various entertainment media.\n\nThe film was released in the United Kingdom on April 15, 2009, two days prior to its North American release date, April 17, 2009. Critics were not given advance screening of the film; those who saw it upon release, however, praised Statham's performance but criticized it as excessively violent, offensive, and visually unappealing.\n\n==Plot==\nChev Chelios lands in the middle of an intersection after [[Crank (film)|falling out of a helicopter.]] He is scooped off the street by gangsters and removed from the scene. Chev wakes up in a makeshift hospital and sees doctors removing his heart while Johnny Vang watches. The doctors place an [[artificial heart]] in his chest. He wakes up later and escapes, noticing an external battery pack is attached to him. By interrogating a thug, he learns the location of Johnny Vang: the Cypress Social Club.\n\nChev calls Doc Miles, who says that Chev has been fitted with an [[AbioCor|AbioCor artificial heart]]. Miles informs Chev that once the external battery pack runs out, the internal battery will kick in and he will have 60 minutes before it stops working. Chev crashes his car, destroying the external battery pack. After getting directions from a driver, Chev has the driver use jumper cables on him to charge the internal battery. At the club, Chev loses Vang but picks up a prostitute named Ria, who sends him to a strip club where Vang is hiding out. In the club, Chev finds Eve, who is now working as a stripper. A group of Mexican mobsters, led by Chico, show up looking for Chev. After a gunfight, Chev learns that a mobster named \"El Hur\u00f3n\" (\"The Ferret\") wants to kill him, but he doesn't find out why.\n\nChev commandeers a police cruiser with Eve and another stripper. The stripper tells Chev that he should look at the Hollywood Racetrack for Johnny Vang. Along the way, Chev meets Venus, the brother of Chev's deceased associate Kaylo. Wanting his help, Chev tells Venus that El Huron was involved in his brother's death. At the horse track Chev begins losing energy again. Another call to Doc Miles informs him that friction will cause static electricity to power the internal battery. Eve arrives and has sex with Chev on the racetrack, which generates enough friction to charge the heart. Chev spots Vang and leaves Eve behind. Vang escapes, and Chev is about to be subdued by security when Don Kim picks Chev up in a [[Limousine|limo]]. He informs Chev that there is a prominent leader in the Triads named Poon Dong, who was in need of a heart transplant and chose Chev's to replace his. Chev kills Don Kim and his henchmen upon learning that Don Kim wishes to return him to Poon Dong for a reward. Meanwhile, Venus calls in Orlando to assist in tracking down El Huron.\n\nWhile searching for Vang, Chev boards an ambulance and steals a battery pack for his artificial heart. Chev exits the ambulance upon seeing Johnny Vang on the street outside and a shootout ensues before Chev subdues Vang. Chev learns that his heart has already been transplanted into Poon Dong. Johnny Vang is shot and killed by Chico as Chev questions him, and Chev is knocked unconscious. Doc Miles uses his secretary, Dark Chocolate, to lure Poon Dong into his apartment to kill him and retrieve Chev's heart.\n\nChev is taken to [[Santa Catalina Island (California)|Catalina Island]] where El Huron awaits. It is revealed that El Huron is the brother of Ricky and Alex Verona, both of whom Chelios killed. El Huron also reveals that Ricky Verona's disembodied head is being artificially kept alive long enough to watch El Huron kill Chelios. Orlando, Venus and Ria suddenly arrive with backup, and a shootout ensues, killing most of El Huron's men. Ricky Verona's head is killed during the melee. As he starts to slow down, Chev climbs a nearby electric pole and grabs a pair of live wires to recharge, being set on fire by the massive current. He returns fully powered and beats El Huron to death.  Due to a hallucination caused by the electric currents, he sees Ria as Eve and kisses her, inadvertently setting her ablaze.  Chev [[Breaking the fourth wall|walks towards the camera and gives the audience]] the [[Finger (gesture)|middle finger]].\n\nDuring the end credits, Doc Miles replaces Chev's heart. Chelios's eyes open and his heart monitor indicates normal activity.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jason Statham]] as Chev Chelios\n** [[Billy Unger]] as Young Chev Chelios\n* [[Amy Smart]] as Eve Lydon\n* [[Efren Ramirez]] as Venus\n* [[Dwight Yoakam]] as \"Doc\" Miles\n* [[Reno Wilson]] as Orlando\n* [[Clifton Collins, Jr.]] as Jesus \"El Huron\" Verona\n* [[Geri Halliwell]] as Karen Chelios\n* [[Art Hsu]] as Johnny Vang\n* [[Bai Ling]] as Ria\n* [[David Carradine]] as Poon Dong\n* [[Corey Haim]] as Randy\n* [[Keone Young]] as Don Kim\n* Julanne Chidi Hill as \"Dark Chocolate\"\n* [[Jose Pablo Cantillo]] as Ricky Verona\n* [[Yeva-Genevieve Lavlinski]] as \"Pepper\"\n* [[John de Lancie]] as \"Fish\" Halman\n\nCelebrity cameos include [[Ron Jeremy]], [[Ed Powers]], [[Jenna Haze]], [[Nick Manning]], [[Lexington Steele]], [[Chester Bennington]], [[Glenn Howerton]], [[Maynard James Keenan]], [[Danny Lohner]], [[Keith Jardine]], [[Lauren Holly]], and [[Lloyd Kaufman]].\n\n==Production==\nAfter the modest success of ''[[Crank (film)|Crank]]'' at the box office, its directors [[Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor]] were approached by [[Lionsgate Films]] to direct a sequel.{{Sfn|Neveldine|Taylor|2009}} Neveldine and Taylor refused, explaining that the idea \"sounded ridiculous\" and \"kinda lame\" as they had already \"killed\" its protagonist, Chev Chelios, at the end of ''Crank''. According to producer [[Skip Williamson (producer)|Skip Williamson]], the duo passed on the opportunity to direct because \"they didn't think they could toughen themselves\" due to the \"outlandishness\" of the first film and would rather stay on as screenwriters.{{Sfn|Neveldine|Taylor|2009}} The duo later became interested to direct the finished script; Taylor explained that he and Neveldine \"had fallen in love with [the script] and we were not going to let anyone else touch it\", believing no other director could direct it better than they.{{Sfn|Production|2009}} Taylor said the writing process was relatively \"easier\" on ''Crank 2'' since the script picked up where the first film left off and adopted the same location and a few characters of the original. As such, Taylor saw the script as an opportunity to write Chelios' dialogue in the way that matched Statham's British [[vernacular]], something he was unable to do on the first film since he had written the role specifically for an American actor before Statham was cast.{{Sfn|Production|2009}}\n\nAn October 2007 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' report stated that [[Jason Statham]] was set to reprise his role as Chelios for ''Crank 2''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Siegel |first1=Tatiana |title=Jason Statham to reprise 'Crank' role |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/markets-festivals/jason-statham-to-reprise-crank-role-1117974972/ |website=Variety |date=October 29, 2007 |access-date=June 12, 2021}}</ref> Statham himself was thrilled to be on the sequel, stating he \"was  completely excited  by  how  ludicrous  and  outrageous  they  made  part  two.
