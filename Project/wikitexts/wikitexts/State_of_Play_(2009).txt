It is based on the 2003 British television serial [[State of Play (TV serial)|of the same name]].\n\nThe film tells of a journalist's ([[Russell Crowe]]) probe into the suspicious death of the assistant and mistress of a [[United States Congress|Congressman]] ([[Ben Affleck]]). The supporting cast includes [[Rachel McAdams]], [[Helen Mirren]], [[Jason Bateman]], [[Robin Wright (actress)|Robin Wright]], and [[Jeff Daniels]].\n\nMacdonald said that ''State of Play'' is influenced by the [[1970s in film|films of the 1970s]]. He explores the privatization of American [[Homeland Security]] and, to a minor extent, journalistic independence, along with the relationship between politicians and the [[print media|press]]. Released in North America on April 17, 2009, the film received generally positive reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nOne night, thief Deshaun Stagg,\u00a0fleeing through [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], [[Washington, D.C.]], is shot and killed by a man carrying a metal briefcase. A pizza deliveryman witnesses the crime and is also shot, but left in a coma. The following morning, a young woman is killed by a [[Washington Metro]] train in what is presumed to be a [[suicide]].\n\nCongressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) is distraught to learn the dead woman was Sonia Baker, a chief researcher on his staff. Collins, who is a military veteran, is leading an investigation into PointCorp, a [[private military company|private defense contractor]] with controversial operations involving [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. Collins tells his old college roommate and friend Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe), an investigative reporter for the fictional ''Washington Globe'', that he had been having an affair with Sonia. She had sent him a cheerful video message on the morning of her death, which he believes indicates that she wasn't suicidal.\n\nDella Frye (Rachel McAdams), a political reporter and [[Capitol Hill]] blogger for the online division of the ''Globe'', discovers Sonia's death occurred in one of the only three [[CCTV]] blind spots in the Metro camera system. Cal also finds a link between the shootings and Sonia's death. Later, Cal is sought out by a homeless girl, Mandi, who sells him photographs that Stagg,\u00a0her friend, had taken from the metal briefcase, revealed to contain a gun and peculiar handmade bullets. The photos are surveillance images of Sonia talking to a well-dressed man. Della visits the hospital where the pizza deliveryman is coming out of his coma. Before she can talk to him, he is shot through the window and killed by an unseen sniper. Later, while reviewing the CCTV footage of the Metro platform area where Sonia died, Della recognizes a man as the same person she just saw at the hospital prior to the deliveryman's murder.\n\nIt is revealed that PointCorp stands to gain billions of dollars from mercenary activities in the [[Middle East]] and domestically. Collins tells Cal his findings: PointCorp, along with other defense contractors, have a [[monopoly]] on government surveillance and defense contracts, basically [[Privatize|privatizing]] American security. An unnamed PointCorp insider gives Cal information on a person connected to the suspected assassin. Cal tracks the lead to an apartment complex, but finds the assassin instead. He chases Cal to the complex's garage and tries to kill him, but Cal calls the police and the assassin flees. Cal and Della later learn that Mandi has been killed.\n\nWith the aid of Sonia's flatmate Rhonda Silver (Katy Mixon), Della identifies the well-dressed man with Sonia in the photographs as Dominic Foy ([[Jason Bateman]]), a [[Public relations|PR]] executive of a subsidiary of PointCorp. Silver also informs them about a threesome with Sonia and Collins, and wants to go public with this information; however, Della and Cal doubt her credibility. Meanwhile, other media organizations report on the story. Editor Cameron Lynne (Helen Mirren) is livid, as this would have boosted the ''Globe''<nowiki/>'s sales.\n \nCal coerces Foy into talking about Sonia, secretly filming their conversation. Foy reveals Sonia was secretly working for PointCorp and spying on Collins. However, she fell in love and was pregnant with Collins' baby when she was killed. Cal reveals this information to Collins by playing the tape of the interview with Foy for him. Furious, Collins attacks Foy, lashes out at Cal, and storms off. Later that evening, Cal confronts Congressman George Fergus (Jeff Daniels), the chief whip congressman who had pretended to mentor Collins and recommended Sonia for the research position on Collins' staff. Cal informs Fergus that he plans to run a story about the link between Fergus and PointCorp, and how Fergus attempted to undermine Collins's investigation.\n\nCal's boss, Cameron Lynne, refuses to print his story due to the lack of credible sources. Just then, Collins and his wife Anne (Robin Wright) stop by the ''Globe''<nowiki/>'s offices. Collins presents his research on PointCorp, talks about his affair with Sonia, and states his belief that PointCorp had Sonia killed when she stopped reporting back to them. Afterwards, Anne, whose conversation with Cal implies a past love triangle from their college years, casually mentions Sonia was secretly being paid $26,000 a month by PointCorp.\n\nLater, while talking with Della, Cal remembers Collins was never shown the portion of Foy's interview tape that mentioned the specific amount of money Sonia was being paid by PointCorp. He realizes Collins knows much more about Sonia's involvement with the company than he is letting on and wonders if Collins is somehow connected to Sonia's murder. Cal recognizes the assassin in an old group military photo that also features Collins, confirming his hunch. Cal goes to Collins's office to confront him. Collins admits he had been suspicious of Sonia, and that he hired the assassin, [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] corporal Robert Bingham ([[Michael Berresse]]), whose life Collins had once saved, to spy on her and report back to him. Collins says that Bingham hated PointCorp more than he did, and that he never told Bingham to kill Sonia.\n\nCal tells Collins the police will be arriving shortly. As he leaves the building, Cal is confronted by Bingham. Officers arrive and shoot and kill Bingham before he can shoot Cal. Back at the newspaper later that night, Cal types up the story. He reports that Collins was arrested for his role in the deaths of Sonia, the thief, the homeless girl, and the deliveryman. He puts Della first on the byline and lets her submit the story for publication.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Character !!
