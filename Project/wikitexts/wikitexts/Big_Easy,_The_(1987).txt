His investigation leads him to suspect that fellow members of the police force may be involved.\n\nAnne Osborne ([[Ellen Barkin]]), a state [[district attorney]], is sent to investigate alleged police corruption. After seeing firsthand some unorthodox practices by Remy, Anne accuses him of being on the take. He argues that she lacks an understanding of how the system works in New Orleans for police.\n\nDespite Anne's suspicious and apprehensive feelings towards him, they form a romantic relationship. When McSwain is caught accepting payoffs in an Internal Affairs sting, Anne has the burden of prosecuting him. With the assistance of Remy's fellow officers within the police force, crucial evidence is destroyed and suppressed. Remy is cleared of the charges, at which point Anne, now clued in, is conflicted over her personal feelings for Remy and her duty to uphold the law.\n\nIt is later revealed that Jack Kellom ([[Ned Beatty]]), Remy's boss and also his mother's fianc\u00e9, and detectives De Soto ([[John Goodman]]) and Dodge ([[Ebbe Roe Smith]]) are behind the spate of murders and a stash of heroin that is hidden at a boat yard. Kellom goes to the boat and is confronted by De Soto and Dodge. Kellom suggests getting rid of the drugs, but De Soto shoots Kellom. Remy and Anne arrive and are confronted by De Soto and Dodge, and a shootout ensues, resulting in De Soto being shot by a fatally wounded Kellom, and Remy shooting Dodge with a [[flare gun]], which starts a fire. Remy and Anne barely escape before the boat explodes.\n\nThe final scene shows Remy carrying Anne into her apartment, then the two dancing; it appears they were just married.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Dennis Quaid]] as Detective Lieutenant Remy McSwain\n*[[Ellen Barkin]] as A.D.A.
