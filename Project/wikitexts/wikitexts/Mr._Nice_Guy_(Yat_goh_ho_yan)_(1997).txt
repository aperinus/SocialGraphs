Hung cameos as an unfortunate cyclist. The film was released in [[Hong Kong]] on 31 January 1997.\n\n''Mr. Nice Guy'' features a collaboration between Chan and Norton, reuniting them for the first time since 1993's ''[[City Hunter (film)|City Hunter]]''. Set in [[Melbourne]], Australia, it is Chan's first film to be scripted and shot in English.\n\n==Plot==\nTelevision journalist Diana records footage of a [[cocaine]] deal gone wrong between the Italian mob and a street gang called The Demons. During the deal, mob boss Giancarlo kills the Demons' leader Grank and a gun fight ensues. Giancarlo spots Diana and her partner Richard and orders his gang to chase them. Richard is captured while Diana flees from the mobsters, bumping into [[celebrity chef|TV chef]] Jackie, who helps her escape. During the chase, she accidentally switches the videotape of the drug trade with one of Jackie's cooking videos. Jackie brings the tape to his adoptive brother Romeo, a police officer. Romeo's children watch the video, unaware of what it is and that their father is investigating the mob. The mob force Richard to give them Diana's address. They ambush Diana at her house and kidnap her when they realize the tapes were switched and Jackie has the tape they want. Diana escapes after creating a distraction in front of a crowd. \n\nThe mob believes Jackie has the tape and follows him around, while some Demons follow them, hoping for a chance to kill some of the mobsters in retaliation for killing Grank. Jackie is forced to fend them off and run when they attack him at a benefit event he is hosting at the mall. Puzzled at the mobsters' actions, one of the Demons asks a mobster why they're chasing Jackie. Jackie learns why the mob is chasing him after Diana sneaks into his house searching for the tape. She is attacked by Jackie's friend Lakeisha, who thinks her an intruder, but Jackie intervenes. Diana begs for the tape, but Jackie is convinced that he doesn't have it. Before Diana can leave Jackie's apartment building, Giancarlo's henchmen show up, unaware that Demon members have been following them.\n\nJackie and the women escape from the roof just as the Demons throw grenades in Jackie's apartment, killing the mobsters and blowing up Jackie's apartment. The Demons realize afterwards that was Jackie's apartment, and how serious Giancarlo is about retrieving the videotape. They decide to exploit the situation in order to extort money from Giancarlo. They call Giancarlo to set up a meeting to trade the tape and the mob's stolen cocaine for a large sum of money. Everyone decides to stay at Lakeisha's home for safety, but the Demons soon find them. They kidnap Jackie's girlfriend Miki ([[Miki Lee]]) and give Jackie a cell phone, demanding that he give them the videotape in 12 hours. Jackie turns to Romeo for the police's help. The next day, Jackie goes to meet the Demons to trade in a decoy videotape, but no Demon meets Jackie in person. Instead, they frequently call him on his cell phone and make him go to various locations in the city.\n\nThe police trace each call, but discover the Demons are trying to thwart their presence, so they follow Jackie instead. However, the gang discovers this and they escape with Miki. Jackie, angry at the cops' mishandling, refuses to work with them anymore. However, he is kidnapped by the Demons moments later. Jackie fights off the gang and causes their van to crash. Before the police show up, Jackie forces one of the Demons to tell him where Miki is: at a construction site. Jackie insists to Diana and Lakeisha not to follow him to the construction site, but they go there anyway. While Jackie looks for Miki, Giancarlo and his men show up. A fight ensues between Jackie and the mobsters, which ends in Jackie getting captured. Lakeisha and Miki are also taken, while Diana is injured but escapes. Giancarlo murders the other Demons on site except for Tara, who also escapes but with serious injuries.\n\nMeanwhile, Romeo discovers his son watching Diana's tape, the proof he needs to arrest the mob, and visits the hospital where Diana and Tara are being treated. The women inform him about what happened to Jackie and the others. At Giancarlo's home, Giancarlo demands the tape from Jackie one last time. Jackie decides to call Romeo, but he's not home. Afterwards Jackie is forced into an unfair fight with Giancarlo. After taking a beating, Giancarlo orders his men to kill Jackie and the women at \"the guesthouse\", which is code for a mining site used by Giancarlo where he buries people alive. However, they escape and destroy Giancarlo's home by driving through it in a 120-ton [[Haul truck|mining vehicle]], which also causes cocaine to be spread outside in view of the police. The authorities arrive with Romeo, but they decide to state that they did not witness anything and that it was just another gang battle, so that Jackie can go free while the mobsters are arrested for possession of cocaine.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as Jackie \n* [[Richard Norton (actor)|Richard Norton]] as Giancarlo Luchetti\n* Miki Lee as Miki \n* Karen McLymont as Lakeisha\n* [[Gabrielle Fitzpatrick]] as Diana \n* Vince Poletto as Romeo \n* [[Barry Otto]] as Baggio \n* [[Sammo Hung]] as Cyclist\n* [[Wakin Chau|Emil Chau]] as Ice Cream Vendor \n* [[Joyce Godenzi]] as Cook Show Audience (as Mina Godenzi)\n* Peter Houghton as Richard \n* Peter Lindsay as \"Grank\", Demon Gang Leader \n* David No as Victor\n* [[Rachel Blakely]] as Sandy, Demon Gang Member\n* Aaron Notarfrancesco as Sonny \n* Jake Notarfrancesco as Nancy \n* Greg Jamieson as Priest \n* [[Matthew Dyktynski]] as Cooking Show Floor Manager \n* Salik Silverstein as Cooking Show Director \n* [[Lynne Murphy]] as The Babysitter \n* [[Carla Bonner]] as Cameo Role\n* Karl Ajami as Giancarlo's Goon #1\n* [[Brad Allan]] as Giancarlo's Goon #2 (as Bradley Allan)\n* [[Paul Andreovski]] as Giancarlo's Goon #3\n* Habby Heske as Giancarlo's Goon #4\n* [[Cameron Douglas]] as Giancarlo's Goon #5\n* [[Grant Page]] as Giancarlo's Goon #6\n* [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]] as Giancarlo's Goon #7\n* David Baldwin as Giancarlo's Goon #8\n* Brent Houghton as Giancarlo's Goon #9\n* Ian Mall as Giancarlo's #10\n* Dennis Christensen as Giancarlo's Goon #11\n* Michael John Noonan as Giancarlo's Goon #12\n* Darko Tuskan as Giancarlo's Goon #13\n* John Raaen as Giancarlo's Goon #14\n* Gary Shambrooke as Giancarlo's Goon #15\n* [[Andy Cheng]] as Giancarlo's Goon at Construction Site (extra) (uncredited)\n* [[Mars (actor)|Mars]] as Extra (uncredited)\n* Frederick Miragliotta as Captain Morrison\n* Nai Su Rak as Female in Chinatown (extra) (uncredited)\n* Phillip Hobden as Male Police Officer (extra) (uncredited) \n* Graham Pearson as Male Police Officer (extra) (uncredited) \n* [[Doug Selby]] as Male Police Officer (extra) (uncredited)\n\n===Jackie Chan Stunt Team===\n* [[Brad Allan]]\n* Chan Man-Ching\n* [[Andy Cheng]]\n* Rocky Lai\n* [[Nicky Li]]\n* [[Mars (actor)|Mars]]\n* Lee Seung Hoon\n\n==Production==\nThe film was originally going to be the fifth film in Jackie Chan's ''[[Police Story (film series)|Police Story]]'' film series, with its setting in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], but in a month's time it was revised to become a stand-alone action film set in [[Melbourne]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gentry|first=Clyde III|title=Jackie Chan: Inside the Dragon|date=April 1997|publisher=[[Taylor Publishing|Taylor Publishing Company]]|location=[[Dallas]], [[Texas]]|isbn=978-0-87833-970-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/jackiechaninside00gent/page/59 59]|url=https://archive.org/details/jackiechaninside00gent|url-access=registration|accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref> It is Chan's first film to be scripted and shot in English.<ref name=\"Minnesota\">{{cite book|editor-last=Yau|editor-first=Esther|title=At Full Speed: Hong Kong Cinema in a Borderless World|date=2001|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]|location=[[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]]|isbn=0-8166-3234-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/atfullspeedhongk00yauc/page/134 134]\u2013135|url=https://archive.org/details/atfullspeedhongk00yauc|url-access=registration|accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nAccording to his book ''I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action'', Chan hurt his neck when he messed up on a flip during a fight scene.
