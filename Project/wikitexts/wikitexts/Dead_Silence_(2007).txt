The film stars [[Ryan Kwanten]] as Jamie Ashen, a young widower returning to his hometown to search for answers to his wife's death. It also stars [[Amber Valletta]], [[Donnie Wahlberg]], and [[Bob Gunton]].\n\n''Dead Silence'' was theatrically released in the United States on March 16, 2007, by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film was dedicated to [[Gregg Hoffman]]. Despite receiving initial negative reviews, the film has since gathered a [[cult following]].\n\n==Plot==\nJamie Ashen and his wife, Lisa, receive an anonymous gift of a [[ventriloquist]] doll called \"Billy\". When Jamie goes out to pick up their takeout dinner, a figure attacks Lisa, who is pregnant, causing her to have a miscarriage and scream. Jamie returns home and finds her dead with her tongue cut out. After Jamie is released from custody by Detective Jim Lipton due to lack of evidence, he spots inside Billy's box a mysterious message about \"Mary Shaw\", a deceased ventriloquist from his hometown, Raven's Fair.\n\nReturning to Raven's Fair, now old and rundown, Jamie visits his estranged, wealthy and wheelchair-using father, Edward, and his much-younger wife, Ella, for information regarding Mary Shaw. Dismissing them as superstitions, Jamie arranges for Lisa's funeral with the help of a local mortician named Henry Walker. Henry's senile wife, Marion, warns Jamie that Mary Shaw's spirit is dangerous and urges him to bury Billy. Jamie does so but is confronted by Detective Lipton, who followed Jamie and finds his actions suspicious.\n\nHenry explains to Jamie that Mary Shaw was a famous and popular ventriloquist who was publicly humiliated when a young boy named Michael rudely claimed that he could see her lips moving during one of her performances. Some weeks later, Michael disappeared and his family blamed it on Mary Shaw and lynched her. Mary's last wish was to have her body turned into a doll and buried with her 101 dolls, who she called her children. Henry, then still a child, saw Shaw (after she was turned into a dummy) rise up, but was spared thanks to his silence, because Mary takes her revenge by killing those who scream. Jamie finds out that Michael, who actually ''was'' murdered by Mary Shaw, was his great-uncle. As part of Mary's lynching, the Ashen family forced her to scream and permanently silenced her by cutting her tongue out; as such, she has since been seeking revenge against their entire bloodline and all those in Raven's Fair by killing them using the same method.\n\nMary Shaw kills Henry Walker and Detective Lipton discovers that all of Mary Shaw's dolls have been dug up. He informs Jamie and is just about to arrest him, when Jamie receives a call from \"Henry\", asking him to go to Shaw's old theatre to prove his innocence. At the ruined theater, Jamie and Lipton discover 100 of the dolls in their massive display case, along with Michael's body, which had been turned into a marionette. Mary reveals to Jamie that she killed Lisa because, unbeknownst to him, she was pregnant with his child, thereby killing any potential newborn of the Ashen family. Jamie and Lipton burn the theatre and all of Shaw's dolls, but Lipton falls and screams, sealing his fate.\n\nBack at his father's residence, Jamie is confronted by Mary, but repels her by throwing Billy into the fireplace. He learns, much to his horror, that his father actually died long ago; the current \"Edward\" is actually a doll converted from his corpse, controlled by Ella, who is the \"perfect doll\" that Mary Shaw created just before her death. Jamie screams in terror as Ella, possessed by Mary, kills him.\n\nThe film ends with Jamie reciting a nursery rhyme about Shaw while a photo album with human puppets is shown: Lisa, Henry, Lipton, Edward, Ella, and Jamie himself. Mary closes the book, finally completing her revenge.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ryan Kwanten]] as Jamie Ashen \n* [[Amber Valletta]] as Ella Ashen\n* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as Detective Jim Lipton\n* [[Bob Gunton]] as Edward Ashen\n* [[Michael Fairman]] as Henry Walker\n** [[Keir Gilchrist]] as Young Henry Walker\n* Joan Heney as Marion Walker\n* [[Laura Regan]] as Lisa Ashen\n* [[Judith Roberts (actress)|Judith Roberts]] as Mary Shaw\n* Steven Taylor as Michael Ashen\n* [[Dmitry Chepovetsky]] as Richard Walker\n* Shelley Peterson as Lisa's Mom\n* [[Enn Reitel]] as Billy (voice)\n* [[Fred Tatasciore]] as the Clown Doll (voice)\n* [[Julian Richings]] as Boz (uncredited and deleted scenes)\n\n== Production ==\nFilming took place in [[Toronto, Ontario, Canada]].\n\n==Release==\n''Dead Silence'' was released in the United States on March 16, 2007,<ref>{{cite web|title=Release dates for Dead Silence (2007)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455760/releaseinfo|work=IMDb|publisher=IMDb.com, Inc.|access-date=1 August 2012|author=IMDb|year=1990\u20132012}}</ref> with an \"[[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Ratings|R]]\" rating for Violence.\n\n===Box office===\nIn the United States, as of April 16, 2007, the film's total domestic [[Gross (economics)|gross]] has been worth [[United States dollar|US$]]16.8 million (according to [[Box Office Mojo]]), and screenings of ''Dead Silence'' were ceased in most theatres 16 days following its release; the film's estimated [[production budget]] was US$20 million.

In the scenes, she uses her tongue to frighten her victims, making it slither from her mouth (she licks Jamie's cheek in one scene). Along with the tongues of her victims, Mary acquires their voices as well.\n* Jamie attempting to swim out of the theatre is slightly extended.\n* In an alternate ending, Ella simply knocks Jamie out after he discovers his father was a puppet all along. Then, she explains that the original Ella was a human being with Edward as an abusive husband. Edward knocked her down the stairs and killed their unborn child. Ella dug up the grave where the puppet Billy was buried and became possessed by Mary Shaw. Afterwards, Ella makes a family photograph and then (dressed as Mary Shaw) tells a bedtime story to a child by candlelight, later revealed to be a traumatized and brainwashed (yet still very much alive) Jamie with his voice removed or tongue ripped out (or it would have been had they added the visual effect planned). This story is the poem. Ella also reveals that only silence can save you from Mary Shaw. Then she blows out the candle, ending the film.\n* [[Billy the Puppet|The Billy puppet]] from the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' franchise]] makes a brief [[Cameo appearance|cameo]]; it can be seen sitting on the floor as Jamie starts to walk towards the clown doll.\n\n==Post-release commentary==\nIn his personal [[blog]], screenwriter Whannell reveals the origins of the film within the context of the [[Film industry#Hollywood|Hollywood film industry]]. In a candid post entitled \"Dud Silence: The Hellish Experience of Making a Bad Horror Film\", Whannell explains that the film was conceived following the advice of his [[Talent agent|agent]] at the time and that a \"[[script doctor]]\" was eventually employed by the [[Film studio|production studio]]. Whannell concludes the post with a description of the key lessons that were learned following the ''Dead Silence'' experience:\n\n{{blockquote|\nAfter everything is said and done, I'm almost glad ''Dead Silence'' happened, because it gave me an extreme, coal-face lesson in what not to do. It was like learning to swim by leaping off Niagara Falls. I only write scripts on spec now, which means that I write them in my own time without getting paid and then take them out into the world to see if anyone's interested. Never again will I enter the arranged marriage of selling a pitch. I have also become very gun-shy about working with studios. In the world of independent film, what you write ends up on screen. Plus, they don't have the money to bring in script doctors! Works fine for me. Who knows, maybe one day I will work with a studio again...<ref>{{cite web|title=Dud Silence: The Hellish Experience Of Making A Bad Horror Film|url=http://thewordinthestone.com/#!111|work=Word In The Stone|publisher=Leigh Whannell|access-date=2021-12-06|author=Leigh Whannell|date=31 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709023933/http://thewordinthestone.com/#!111|archive-date=July 9, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://deadsilencemovie.net/}}\n* {{IMDb title|0455760|Dead Silence}}\n* {{Allmovie title|329263|Dead Silence}} \n* {{mojo title|deadsilence|Dead Silence}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|dead_silence|Dead Silence}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=Dead Silence}}\n\n{{James Wan}}\n{{Leigh Whannell}}\n{{Twisted Pictures}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dead Silence}}\n[[Category:2007 films]]\n[[Category:2007 horror films]]\n[[Category:American supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Charlie Clouser]]\n[[Category:Films directed by James Wan]]\n[[Category:Mannequins in films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by James Wan]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Leigh Whannell]]\n[[Category:Ventriloquism]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films about spirit possession]]\n[[Category:2000s supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:Horror films about toys]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
