Destroying the nearby town of [[Dale (Middle-earth)|Dale]], Smaug drove the Dwarves out of their mountain and took their hoard of gold. Thr\u00f3r's grandson, [[Thorin Oakenshield|Thorin]], sees [[Thranduil|King Thranduil]] and his [[Silvan Elves|Wood-elves]] on a nearby hillside, and is dismayed when they leave rather than aid his people, resulting in Thorin's everlasting hatred of [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]].\n\nIn the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]], 50-year-old Bilbo is tricked by the [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]] [[Gandalf|Gandalf the Grey]] into hosting a dinner for Thorin and his company of Dwarves: [[Balin (Middle-earth)|Balin]], [[Dwalin]], [[F\u00edli]], [[K\u00edli]], [[Dori (Middle-earth)|Dori]], [[Nori (Middle-earth)|Nori]], [[Ori (dwarf)|Ori]], [[\u00d3in, son of Gr\u00f3in|\u00d3in]], [[Gl\u00f3in]], [[Bifur]], [[Bofur]], and [[Bombur (Middle-earth)|Bombur]]. Gandalf's aim is to recruit Bilbo as the company's \"burglar\" to aid them in their quest to enter the Lonely Mountain. Bilbo is unwilling to accept at first, but has a change of heart after the company leaves without him the next day. Bilbo races to join the company. Travelling onward, the company is captured by three [[Troll (Middle-earth)|Trolls]]. Bilbo stalls the Trolls from eating them until dawn, and Gandalf exposes the trolls to sunlight, turning them to stone. The company locates the Trolls' cave and finds treasure and Elven blades. Thorin and Gandalf each take an Elf-made blade, [[Orcrist]] and [[Glamdring]], respectively; Gandalf also finds an [[Sting (Middle-earth)|Elven dagger]], which he gives to Bilbo.\n\nThe wizard [[Radagast|Radagast the Brown]] finds Gandalf and the company, and recounts an encounter at [[Dol Guldur]] with the [[Sauron|Necromancer]], a sorcerer who has been corrupting [[Mirkwood|Greenwood]] with dark magic. Chased by [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]], Gandalf leads the company through a hidden passage to [[Rivendell]]. There, [[Elrond|Lord Elrond]] discloses a hidden indication of a secret door on the company's map of the Lonely Mountain, which will be visible only on [[Durin's Day]]. Gandalf later approaches the [[White Council]] \u2014 consisting of Elrond, [[Galadriel]] and [[Saruman|Saruman the White]] \u2014 and presents a [[Morgul blade]], a weapon of the [[Witch-king of Angmar]], which Radagast obtained from Dol Guldur as a sign that the Necromancer is linked to an eventual return of [[Sauron]]. While Saruman presses concern to the more present matter of the Dwarves' quest, requesting that Gandalf put an end to it, Gandalf secretly reveals to Galadriel he had anticipated this and had the Dwarves move forward without him.\n\nThe company journeys into the [[Misty Mountains]], where they find themselves amid a colossal battle between [[Giant (mythology)|Stone Giants]]. They take refuge in a cave and are captured by [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Goblins]], who take them to their leader, the Great Goblin. Bilbo becomes separated from the Dwarves and falls into a crevice where he encounters [[Gollum]], who unknowingly drops a [[One Ring|golden ring]]. Pocketing the ring, Bilbo finds himself confronted by Gollum. They play a riddle game, wagering that Bilbo will be shown the way out if he wins or eaten by Gollum if he loses. Bilbo eventually wins by asking Gollum what he has in his pocket. Noticing his ring is lost, Gollum realises that Bilbo possesses it and chases him. Bilbo discovers that the ring grants him invisibility, but when he has a chance to kill Gollum, Bilbo spares his life out of pity and escapes while Gollum shouts his hatred towards the hobbit Baggins.\n\nMeanwhile, the Great Goblin reveals to the Dwarves that Azog, an Orc war-chief who killed Thr\u00f3r and lost his forearm to Thorin in battle outside the Dwarven kingdom of [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]], has placed a bounty on Thorin's head. Gandalf arrives and leads the Dwarves in an escape, killing the Great Goblin. Bilbo exits the mountain and rejoins the company, keeping his newly obtained ring secret. The company is ambushed by Azog and his hunting party, and takes refuge in trees. Thorin charges at Azog, who overpowers and severely injures him with his [[Warg (Middle-earth)|Warg]]. Bilbo saves Thorin from the Orcs and challenges Azog, just as the company is rescued by [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|eagles]] summoned by Gandalf. They escape to the safety of the [[Carrock#Carrock|Carrock]] where Gandalf revives Thorin, who renounces his previous disdain for Bilbo after being saved by him.\n\nThey see the Lonely Mountain in the distance, where the sleeping Smaug is awoken by a thrush knocking a snail against a stone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further|The Hobbit (film series)#Cast|l1=Cast of The Hobbit film series|The Hobbit (film series)#Casting|l2=Casting of The Hobbit film series}}\n\nThe characters of Galadriel, Saruman, and Frodo Baggins appear in the novel ''The Lord of the Rings'', but not in the novel ''The Hobbit''.
