Based on the 1981 story of the [[Johnny Mnemonic|same name]] by [[William Gibson]], it stars [[Keanu Reeves]] and [[Dolph Lundgren]]. Reeves plays the title character, a man with an overloaded, [[cybernetic]] [[brain implant]] designed to store information. The film portrays Gibson's [[dystopian]], prophetic view of 2021 with the world wracked by a tech-induced plague, awash with conspiracies, and dominated by [[megacorporation]]s, with strong [[East Asia]]n influences.\n\nShot on location in Canada, with [[Toronto]] and [[Montreal]] filling in for the [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] and [[Beijing]] settings, a number of local sites, including Toronto's [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] and Montreal's skyline and [[Jacques Cartier Bridge]], are prominently featured.\n\nA longer version (103 mins) of the film that is closer to the director's cut premiered in Japan on April 15, 1995, featuring a score by [[Mychael Danna]] and different editing.<ref name=nihon/> The film was released in the United States on May 26, 1995. In 2022, a black-and-white edition of the film, titled ''Johnny Mnemonic: In Black and White'', was released.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2021, society is driven by a virtual Internet, which has created a degenerate effect called \"nerve attenuation syndrome\" or NAS. Megacorporations control much of the world, intensifying the class hostility already created by NAS.\n\nJohnny is a \"mnemonic courier\" who discreetly transports sensitive data for corporations in a storage device implanted in his brain at the cost of his childhood memories. His current job is for a group of scientists in [[Beijing]]. Johnny initially balks when he learns the data exceeds his memory capacity even with compression, but agrees given the large fee will be enough to cover the cost of the operation to remove the device. Johnny warns that he must have the data extracted within a few days or suffer psychological damage. The scientists encrypt the data with three random images from a television feed and start sending these images to the receiver in [[Newark, New Jersey]], but they are attacked and killed by the [[Yakuza]], led by a man Shinji (Akiyama) who wields a laser trip wire beam weapon, before the images can be fully transmitted. Johnny escapes with a portion of the images but is pursued by both the Yakuza as well as security forces for Pharmakom, one of the mega-corporations run by Takahashi (Kitano), both seeking the data he carries. Johnny starts witnessing brief images of a female projection of an [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) who attempts to aid Johnny, but he dismisses her.\n\nIn Newark, Johnny meets with his handler Ralfi (Kier) to explain the situation but finds Ralfi is also working with the Yakuza and wants to kill Johnny to get the storage device. Johnny is rescued by Jane (Meyer), a cybernetically-enhanced bodyguard, and members of anti-establishment Lo-Teks and their leader J-Bone (Ice-T), while Ralfi is sliced into pieces by Shinji for getting in his way. Jane takes Johnny to a clinic run by Spider (Rollins), who had installed Jane's implants. Spider reveals he was intended to receive  the Beijing scientists' data, which is the cure for NAS stolen from Pharmakom; Spider claims Pharmakom refuses to release the cure as they are profiting off the mitigation of NAS. Unfortunately, even the portion of the encryption images Johnny took and what Spider had received is not sufficient to decrypt Johnny's mind, and Spider suggests that they see Jones at the Lo-Teks' base. Just then, Karl \"The Street Preacher\" (Lundgren), an assassin hired by Takahashi, attacks the clinic, killing Spider as Johnny and Jane escape.\n\nThe two reach the Lo-Tek base and learn from J-Bone that Jones is a dolphin once used by the [[United States Navy|Navy]] that can help decrypt the data in Johnny's mind. Just as they start the procedure, Shinji and the Yakuza, Takahashi and his security forces, and the Street Preacher all attack the base. Takahashi confronts Johnny and holds him at gunpoint before being gunned down by Shinji who wants the data for himself. Johnny fights Shinji who gains the upper hand but Johnny manages to turn the tables and behead Shinji with his own laser wire. Takahashi having a last minute change of heart turns over a portion of the encryption key to Johnny before he dies, but this still is not enough to fully decrypt the data, and J-Bone tells Johnny that he will need to hack his own mind with Jones' help. Johnny, Jane, J Bone and the Lo Teks manage to defeat the remaining forces sent after them. The Street Preacher arrives and after a fight is defeated by Johnny and Jane by being electrocuted and burned to a crisp.\nThe second attempt starts, and aided by the female AI, Johnny is able to decrypt the data and at the same time recover his childhood memories. The AI is revealed to be the virtual version of Johnny's mother who was also the founder of Pharmakom, angered at the company holding back the cure. As J-Bone transmits the NAS cure information across the Internet, Johnny and Jane watch from afar as the Pharmakom headquarters goes up in flames from the public outcry. J Bone in celebration also disposes of the Street Preachers burnt corpse by having it tossed into the city waters of Newark.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Johnny Mnemonic\n* [[Dolph Lundgren]] as Karl Honig\n* [[Dina Meyer]] as Jane\n* [[Ice-T]] as J-Bone\n* [[Takeshi Kitano]] as Takahashi\n* [[Denis Akiyama]] as Shinji\n* [[Henry Rollins]] as Spider\n* [[Barbara Sukowa]] as Anna Kalmann\n* [[Udo Kier]] as Ralfi\n* [[Tracy Tweed]] as Pretty\n* Falconer Abraham as Yomamma\n* [[Don Francks]] as Hooky\n* Diego Chambers as Henson\n* Arthur Eng as Viet\n\n==Production==\nLongo and Gibson originally envisioned making an [[art film]] on a small budget but failed to get financing.

While not a director's cut, it is nonetheless closer to Longo's intended vision for the film, as he had desired to originally film the movie in black-and-white, but was denied the opportunity to do so. Initially, for the film's 25th anniversary, Longo had ripped a Blu-ray copy of the film and had begun to create a black-and-white version of the film himself. After contacting [[Don Carmody]] and informing him of his intention to release the new version of the film on [[YouTube]], Carmody requested to see it first. Impressed with the result, Carmody convinced Longo to approach Sony Pictures for an official release. Sony Pictures then agreed to provide the film's footage to Longo for a professional conversion, so that they could release the new version on Blu-ray. Longo proceeded to re-grade the film's color in black-and-white, with the help of the film's original colorist Cyrus Stowe. Longo has stated that he is \"happy\" with the new version of the film, as he takes inspiration from black-and-white films such as ''[[Alphaville (film)|Alphaville]]'' and ''[[La Jet\u00e9e]]''. The new version was shown by the Tribeca and Rockaway Film Festivals at an outdoor screening, which sold out, in 2021.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dahl|first=Patrick|title=Johnny Mnemonic in Black-and-White: Robert Longo Interview|url=https://www.screenslate.com/articles/johnny-mnemonic-black-and-white-robert-longo-interview|work=Screenslate|date=10 June 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film holds an 18% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 38 critics.
