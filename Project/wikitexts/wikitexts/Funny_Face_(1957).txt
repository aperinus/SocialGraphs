Although having the same title as the 1927 Broadway musical [[Funny Face (musical)|''Funny Face'']] by the Gershwin brothers, and featuring the same male star ([[Fred Astaire]]), the plot is completely different and only four of the songs from the stage musical are included. Alongside Astaire, the film stars [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[Kay Thompson]].\n\n==Plot==\nMaggie Prescott, a [[fashion magazine]] publisher and editor for ''Quality'' magazine, is looking for the next big fashion trend. She wants a new look which is to be both \"beautiful\" and \"intellectual\". She and top fashion photographer Dick Avery want models who can \"think as well as they look.\" The two brainstorm and come up with the idea to use a book store in [[Greenwich Village]] as backdrop.\n\nThey find what they want in \"Embryo Concepts\", which is being run by the shy shop assistant and amateur philosopher, Jo Stockton. Jo thinks the fashion and modelling industry is nonsense, calling it \"[[wikt:chichi|chichi]], and an unrealistic approach to self-impressions as well as economics\". Maggie decides to use Jo but after the first shot Jo is locked outside to keep her from interrupting Maggie\u2019s take-over of the shop. The crew leaves the store in a shambles; Dick stays behind to help clean up and apologizes to Jo, then kisses her impulsively. Jo dismisses him, but her song \"[[How Long Has This Been Going On?]]\" shows that she feels the stirrings of romance.\n\nWhat Jo wants above all is to go to [[Paris, France|Paris]] and attend the famous Professor \u00c9mile Flostre's philosophy lectures about empathicalism. When Dick gets back to the darkroom, he sees something in Jo's face which is new and fresh and would be perfect for the campaign, giving it \"character\", \"spirit\", and \"intelligence\". They send for Jo, pretending they want to order some books from her shop. Once she arrives, they try to make her over and attempt to cut her hair. She is outraged and runs away, only to hide in the darkroom where Dick is working. When Dick mentions Paris, Jo becomes interested in the chance to see Professor Flostre and is finally persuaded to model for the magazine. Dick sings \"[[Funny Face (1927 song)|Funny Face]]\".\n\nSoon, Maggie, Dick, and Jo are off to Paris to prepare for a major fashion event, shooting photos at famous landmarks from the area. During the various shoots, Jo and Dick fall in love. \"[[He Loves and She Loves]]\". One night, when Jo is getting ready for a gala, she learns that Flostre is giving a lecture at a cafe nearby, which she attends. Eventually, Dick brings her back and they get into an argument at the gala's opening, which results in Jo being publicly embarrassed and Maggie outraged.\n\nJo goes to talk to Flostre at his home. Through some scheming, Maggie and Dick gain entrance to the soir\u00e9e there. After performing an impromptu song and dance for Flostre's disciples, they confront Jo and Flostre. This leads to Dick causing Flostre to fall and knock himself out. Jo urges them to leave but when Flostre comes round, he tries to seduce her. Shocked at the behavior of her \"idol\", she smashes a vase over his head and runs out, returning just in time to take part in the final fashion show. During this, Maggie tries to get in touch with Dick, who has made plans to leave Paris. Before her wedding gown finale, Jo looks out the window and sees the plane Dick was supposed to be on flying over the city. Believing that he has refused to return to her, she runs off the runway in tears at the conclusion of the show.\n\nMeanwhile, Dick is still at the airport. He runs into Flostre and learns how Jo had attacked him. Realizing how much Jo cares, Dick returns to the fashion show, but Jo is nowhere to be found. Finally, after applying the insights of empathicalism at Maggie's behest, Dick guesses that Jo would return to the church where he had photographed her in a wedding dress and they shared their first romantic moment. On his arrival there himself, he finds Jo (in the wedding gown) by a little brook. They join in the duet \"[['S Wonderful]]\" and embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| footer = [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Audrey Hepburn]], the lead stars of the film.\n| image1 = Astaire, Fred - Never Get Rich.jpg\n| width1 = 130\n| image2 = Audrey Hepburn 1956.jpg\n| width2 = 138\n| image3 = \n| width3 = \n| direction = \n| total_width = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\n\n* [[Audrey Hepburn]] as Jo Stockton\n* [[Fred Astaire]] as Dick Avery\n* [[Kay Thompson]] as Maggie Prescott\n* [[Michel Auclair]] as Professor \u00c9mile Flostre\n* [[Robert Flemyng]] as Paul Duval\n* [[Dovima]] as Marion\n* [[Jean Del Val]] as Hairdresser\n* [[Virginia Gibson]] as Babs\n* [[Sue England]] as Laura\n* [[Ruta Lee]] as Lettie\n* Alex Gerry as Dovitch\n* [[Suzy Parker]] as Specialty Dancer (Pink Number)\n* [[Sunny Harnett]] as Specialty Dancer (Pink Number)\n\n==Musical numbers==\n* \"Think Pink!\"\n* \"[[How Long Has This Been Going On?]]\" - originally composed for the musical ''Funny Face'', but not used\n* \"How Long Has This Been Going On?

Astaire also starred in the stage version alongside his sister, [[Adele Astaire]]. The film plot is actually adapted from another Broadway musical, ''Wedding Bells'', by [[Leonard Gershe]]. The original title for the film was ''Wedding Day''.\n\nUnlike her later film [[My Fair Lady (film)|''My Fair Lady'']], Hepburn sings the songs herself in this, her first musical. She performs one solo, \"[[How Long Has This Been Going On?]]\"; a duet with Astaire, \"[['S Wonderful]]\"; a duet with [[Kay Thompson]] called \"On How to Be Lovely\"; and takes part in an ensemble performance of \"Bonjour, Paris!\". Her previous dance training is also called into play, not only in the two dance numbers she performs with Astaire but also for a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]]-style solo dance in a nightclub, which has since often been replayed in retrospectives of her career.\n\nAs was the case with many of her leading men, Astaire was much older than Hepburn. At 58, three decades Hepburn's senior, he was approaching the end of his musical film career, in this, the second in a consecutive series of three French-themed musicals he made in the 1950s. He performs a song and [[Fred Astaire's Solo and Partnered Dances#Solos with miscellaneous props|dance solo with umbrella and cape]] to Gershwin's \"Let's Kiss and Make Up\". According to Hepburn, she insisted on Astaire as a precondition for her participation. Thompson, who usually worked behind the scenes as a musical director for films, makes a rare appearance on camera as Maggie Prescott, a fashion magazine editor loosely based on [[Diana Vreeland]]. (Architectural historian [[Francis Morrone]] says <ref>{{YouTube|id=KjbgLtfW6KI|t=1722}} \u201c20th Century Architecture in New York, with Francis Morrone\u201d</ref> it was [[Carmel Snow]], editor-in-chief of ''[[Harper\u2019s Bazaar]]'', who was the inspiration for the Maggie Prescott character.) Besides her duet with Hepburn, she performs the solo number \"Think Pink!\" in the presence of a dance chorus, and Thompson and Astaire perform a comic dance duet to \"[[Clap Yo' Hands]]\". (While at ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', Vreeland once sent a memo to staff urging them to \"Today let's think pig white! Wouldn't it be wonderful to have stockings that were pig white! The color of baby pigs, not quite white and not quite pink!\"<ref name=\"mahon19890910\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/10/magazine/si-newhouse-and-conde-nast-taking-off-the-white-gloves.html |title=S.I.

Probably the most famous single image from the film is the intentionally overexposed close-up of Hepburn's face in which only her facial features\u2014her eyes, eyebrows, nose and mouth\u2014are visible. This image is seen briefly in black-and-white at the very beginning of the opening title sequence, which was designed by Avedon, during the [[Funny Face (1927 song)|\"Funny Face\"]] musical number which takes place in a [[darkroom]], and when Dick (Astaire) presents it to Maggie (Thompson).\n\nFor location shooting in Paris, Paramount shipped its own camera equipment to France. The studio then sent the same cameras and accessories to [[Madrid]] for use on ''[[Spanish Affair]]'' (1957).<ref>Steinhart, Daniel. (2019).

However, in 1964, when ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' (also starring Hepburn) was released to excellent reviews and huge box office grosses, Paramount theatrically reissued ''Funny Face''. As a result, the film drew substantial crowds and finally turned a profit.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film was generally well received in the United States. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', for example, lauded it as \"delightfully balmy,\" \"colorful and glittering,\" and \"extraordinarily stylish,\" \"with class in every considerable department on which this sort of picture depends.\"<ref name=\"Crowther\">{{cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|title=Screen: 'Funny Face' Brings Spring to Music Hall|date=March 29, 1957|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1957/03/29/archives/screen-funny-face-brings-spring-to-music-hall-audrey-hepburn-and.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=14 January 2022}}</ref> The reviewer for ''[[The Times]]'', however, was not impressed when the film opened at the [[Odeon Leicester Square|Odeon]] in London on April 25, 1957: \"...a displeasing piece of work, pseudo-sophisticated, expensive and brash in approach, vulgar in taste and insensitive in outlook. This, in fact, is the American 'musical' at its worst; not even the presence of Mr Fred Astaire, who was in the original stage production, can save the day. It may seem extravagant to discuss a 'musical' in terms proper to a serious creative work, yet there is that in the film's attitude towards the 'intellectual', whether in Greenwich Village or Paris, which offends. It is not amiable parody and it is not telling satire; it has its roots in the ill-based instinct to jeer, and its jeers are offensive.\"<ref name=Times>The Times review 25 April 1957: ''Odeon Cinema: \"Funny Face\" with Fred Astaire''</ref>\n\nOn review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an 88% rating, based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The consensus summarizes: \"A timeless and elegant musical feast, ''Funny Face'' thrives on the agile and vibrant performances from legendary screen titans Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/funny_face/ | title=Funny Face (1957) | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | access-date=January 21, 2022}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\nThe [[National Board of Review]] gave the film Special Citation award for the photographic innovations. [[Leonard Gershe]] was nominated for \"Best Written American Musical\" by the [[Writers Guild of America]].
