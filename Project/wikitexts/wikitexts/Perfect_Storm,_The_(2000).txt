Boat owner Bob Brown ridicules and taunts Captain Billy Tyne over his recent \"cold streak\". Desperate to redeem himself, Captain Tyne convinces the ''Andrea Gail'' crew to join him for one more late-season fishing expedition. The crew heads out past their usual fishing grounds on the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]], leaving a developing [[tropical storm]] behind them. Initially unsuccessful, they head to the [[Flemish Cap]], where their luck greatly improves. After amassing thousands of pounds of fish, the ice machine breaks down; the only way to sell their catch before it spoils is to hurry back to shore. However, between ''Andrea Gail'' and Gloucester is a confluence of two powerful weather fronts and a hurricane, which the crew underestimates.\n\nAs the crew of ''Andrea Gail'' battles the raging sea, a strong wind breaks the ship's radio antenna just as [[Hurricane Grace|Hurricane ''Grace'']] and the northern weather front [[fujiwhara effect|merge]] with each other atop them. Rookie fisherman Bobby Shatford attempts to fix it but can only watch helplessly as the antenna breaks off and disappears into the sky. Shortly after, Captain [[Linda Greenlaw]] of sister ship ''Hannah Boden'' calls in a [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]] for the ''Andrea Gail''. A [[New York Air National Guard]] [[HH-60 Pave Hawk]] rescue helicopter responds, but after failing to perform a midair refueling with an [[HC-130 Hercules]], the helicopter crew aborts the mission and ditch their aircraft. All but one of the [[Air National Guard]] crew members are rescued by a [[USCG Medium Endurance Cutter#Reliance class cutters|Coast Guard vessel]], the [[USCGC Tamaroa (WMEC-166)|USCGC ''Tamaroa'']].\n\nThe ''Andrea Gail'' endures various problems including 40 foot waves crashing onto the deck, a broken stabilizer ramming the side of the ship with a loose [[anchor]], and two crew members briefly getting thrown overboard. The ship struggles to sail through pounding waves and shrieking winds, while friends and family worry and wait for news. Billy makes a successful attempt to turn the boat around. However, the vessel encounters an enormous [[rogue wave]]. They attempt to drive the boat over the wave, but it crests before it can get to the top and is overturned. Billy elects to [[The captain goes down with the ship|go down with his ship]], the rest of the crew are trapped inside the living quarters, and only one, Bobby, manages to get out. He surfaces and watches as ''Andrea Gail'' rights herself before sinking stern-first into the depths of the Atlantic. Bobby silently says goodbye to his girlfriend and loved ones as the rapidly rising swell carries him away.\n\nThere are no survivors; Linda reads the [[eulogy]] at the memorial. Later, as she heads out to sea again, she remembers Billy soliloquizing about what it means to be a sword (fish) boat captain.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[George Clooney]] as Frank William \"Billy\" Tyne, Jr., captain of ''[[Andrea Gail]]'', a swordfishing boat. Billy is a divorced father of two daughters, who is determined to undertake one last fishing trip before the end of the season to make up for a recent string of poor catches. Petersen asked [[Harrison Ford]] to play the role but declined, his second choice was [[Nicolas Cage]] who also turned it down, and [[Mel Gibson]] was offered the role but wanted too much money.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/72473/29-movies-almost-starred-harrison-ford|title = 29 Movies That Almost Starred Harrison Ford|date = 13 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/article/2000/04/21/perfect-storm/|title=The Perfect Storm|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/65602/15-things-you-might-not-know-about-perfect-storm|title=15 Things You Might Not Know About the Perfect Storm|date=30 June 2015}}</ref>\n*[[Mark Wahlberg]] as Robert \"Bobby\" Shatford, the least experienced of the crew of ''Andrea Gail''. Bobby is the son of Ethel Shatford, the owner of the Crow's Nest, and boyfriend to Chris Cotter. He enjoys commercial fishing, but his deepening relationship with Chris (coupled with her reluctance to let him sail again) creates conflict within himself and between the couple. Yet, he is compelled by the potential to earn more money at sea than he could make with a job on shore to sign on for one last trip.\n*[[John C. Reilly]] as Dale \"Murph\" Murphy, senior crewmember on ''Andrea Gail''. Murph is a veteran fisherman who is divorced with a son with whom he's very involved. Murph has a rocky relationship with crewmember David \"Sully\" Sullivan.\n*[[Diane Lane]] as Christina \"Chris\" Cotter, girlfriend of Bobby Shatford. She does not want Bobby to go on the trip because of a bad feeling she has about it. She spends her time during the last fishing trip decorating an apartment she has rented as a surprise for Bobby to symbolize her commitment to him. \n*[[William Fichtner]] as David \"Sully\" Sullivan, crewmember on ''Andrea Gail''. He signed on to replace crew member Douglas \"Dougie\" Kosco, who gave up his site after the last trip. Sully and Murph initially have an antagonistic relationship that is fueled in part by Sully's past involvement with Murph's ex-wife, although the details are not made clear in the film.\n*[[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] as Michael \"Bugsy\" Moran, a member of ''Andrea Gail'''s crew. Bugsy's somewhat comic inability to connect with women appears to change on the eve of the trip, when he meets Irene, a divorced mother at the Crow's Nest.\n*[[Allen Payne]] as Alfred Pierre, one of the crew of ''Andrea Gail''.\n*[[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]] as [[Linda Greenlaw]], the captain of ''Hannah Boden''. Linda and Billy both captain ships for the same owner and maintain a friendly rivalry. She is concerned about Billy and his crew's going out in what she considers dangerous weather. Linda is the last to speak to ''Andrea Gail''.\n*[[Karen Allen]] as Melissa Brown, crewmember on ''Mistral''.\n*[[Bob Gunton]] as Alexander McAnally III, owner of ''Mistral'', a yacht caught in the storm.\n*[[Christopher McDonald]] as [[Todd Gross]], a Boston [[meteorologist]] working for the WNEV-TV (the present day [[WHDH-TV]]).\n*[[Dash Mihok]] as Sergeant Jeremy Mitchell, a [[United States Air Force Pararescue|pararescueman]] on the [[New York Air National Guard]] rescue helicopter.\n*[[Josh Hopkins]] as Captain Darryl Ennis.\n*[[Michael Ironside]] as Bob Brown, owner of ''Andrea Gail'' and ''Hannah Boden''. Although Brown seems to harbor a deep-seated recognition of Tyne's skills at catching fish, he nevertheless pressures Tyne over the latter's recent inability to bring in larger hauls, resulting in an uneasy relationship between the two.\n*[[Cherry Jones]] as Edie Bailey, crewmember on ''Mistral''.\n*[[Rusty Schwimmer]] as Irene \u201cBig Red\u201d Johnson, a divorced mother of two children.\n*[[Janet Wright]] as Ethel Shatford, Bobby's mother, who supports his relationship with Christina. \n*[[Todd Kimsey]] as Lieutenant Rob Pettit.\nOther notable appearances include [[Joseph D.

Greenlaw acknowledged that Tyne did mention having ice problems, but that was not unusual. \"My one gripe about [the] movie was how Warner Brothers depicted Billy Tyne and his crew as making a very conscious decision to steam into a storm that they knew was dangerous,\" said Greenlaw. \"That is not what happened. ''Andrea Gail'' was three days into their steam home when the storm hit. Whatever happened to ''Andrea Gail'' happened very quickly.\"<ref name=\"GAIL\" />\n\nAn Air National Guard helicopter was dispatched from [[Francis S. Gabreski Air National Guard Base]] on [[Long Island, New York]], but not in response to the ''Andrea Gail'' or ''Satori'' (''Mistral'' in the movie). The helicopter departed mid-storm on a mission to help save a lone Japanese fisherman from a sinking sailboat 250 miles off the New Jersey coast. Unsuccessful and running low on fuel, the Air National Guard [[Sikorsky HH-60 Pave Hawk|Sikorsky HH-60G]] helicopter was compelled to attempt a mid-flight refueling maneuver. The zero-visibility conditions thwarted their efforts, however, and lacking enough fuel to make the flight back to the Long Island base, the crew were forced to ditch the helicopter. After a search by ''Tamaroa'', four of the HH-60's crew were picked up; one was never seen again.  The Japanese yachtsman was later rescued by a Romanian cargo ship.<ref name=\"GAIL\" />\n\nWhen asked about the portrayal of \"Sully\" in the movie, Cathy Sullivan Mustone, an older sister of David \"Sully\" Sullivan, said she was disappointed. \"They made my brother's character out to be a hothead,\" she said. \"I guess every movie needs a villain, but my brother was a funny guy with a loud laugh and a big smile. He had a lot of guts and he loved fishing.\" In fact, Sullivan's bravery and quick thinking made headlines on a different boat\u2014''Harmony''. One night during a winter fishing trip, ''Harmony'' began taking on water while tied to another boat. The crew of ''Harmony'' yelled for help, hoping to wake the nearby crew. No one woke, so Sullivan dove into the icy water, pulling himself on the ropes that tied the boats together. As a result of his bravery, ''Harmony'''s crew was saved. Mustone said, \"At least in the movie, they did represent my brother's bravery in a water rescue scene. He was a good man. And I just know he is at peace in heaven, safe with our Dad.\"<ref name=\"GAIL\" />\n\n===The ''Satori''===\n\nThe crew members of ''Satori'' (renamed ''Mistral'' in the movie) were not rescued by an [[Air National Guard]] helicopter, but rather by a [[U.S. Coast Guard]] helicopter. The helicopter was changed in the film after the Air National Guard had issues consulting with the movie producers. According to the owner's son, ''Satori'' never made a 360\u00b0 roll, although it had two knockdowns, during which it lay on its side for about 30 seconds.<ref name=Satori>{{cite web|title=Satori - Perfect Storm|url=http://www.westsail.org/satoristorm|publisher=Westsail Owners Association|access-date=1 March 2013}}</ref> In response to requests by the crew, Captain Ray Leonard permitted the two crewmembers to make a position report over radio, during which they made an unauthorized Mayday call. One of those crewmembers reported that she was so convinced that she was going to die that she wrote her name down and put it into a plastic bag duct-taped to her stomach so her body could be identified.\n\nThere is controversy over whether the Captain was drunk, as charged by the women in the book, with Leonard objecting to this characterization. Out of compassion for the expected loss of his boat, the Coast Guard did not test his [[blood alcohol level]]s at the time. The Coast Guard declared the voyage manifestly unsafe and ordered everyone off-board, including the unwilling skipper.<ref name=Satori /> The Coast Guard first tried to take them on board via an inflatable boat, but after it was damaged when trying to approach ''Satori'' they sent a helicopter, which is a much riskier approach, as a rescue swimmer must jump into dangerous seas. The Coast Guard helicopter did not try to lower rescue gear onto the yacht (as shown in the movie, where it gets entangled with the mast), but rather asked the crew of ''Satori'' to jump overboard to meet a rescue swimmer in the water. Leonard eventually complied with the request.\n\nAfter the storm, Leonard searched for the ''Satori'', hoping to find her still afloat, but in spite of his attempts she was found a few days later washed ashore on a Maryland beach, a bag of personal belongings still on deck. Leonard paid for a 60-foot fishing vessel to drag her off the beach, helped by a channel dug by Park Rangers who had been guarding the boat. He continued to sail the boat until he sold her to a new owner in 2000.<ref name=Satori />\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\n''The Perfect Storm'' was a box office success.
