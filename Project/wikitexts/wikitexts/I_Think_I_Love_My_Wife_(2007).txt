He is content with his home life in suburban New York with his lovely wife Brenda, a teacher, and his two young children. There is one problem in his marriage: their sex life has stagnated, leaving Richard frustrated and sex-starved. While at work, he occasionally fantasizes about other women, but never acts upon his impulses.\n\nAn encounter with an attractive old friend, Nikki Tru, suddenly casts doubt over his typically resilient self-control. At first she claims to just want to be his friend, but she begins to show up consistently at his Manhattan financial office just to talk or have lunch, which causes his boss, secretaries, and peers to view him with varying degrees of contempt. When Nikki begins to deliberately seduce Richard, he does not know what to do. Against his better judgment, he flies with her out of town for one day on an errand, where he is beaten by her boyfriend. On the way home, Nikki kisses Richard who stops it quickly.\n\nReturning to New York, he returns too late to make a sales presentation at an important business meeting, causing the loss of a lucrative contract and almost his job in the process. Richard reluctantly pursues Nikki still, but when tensions are deep with a suspicious Brenda, he breaks things off with her. Things slowly improve in Richard's usual routine and love life. Months later, Nikki shows up at his office unannounced. Having lunch, Richard learns of her realization that she's older and is currently engaged to another successful man, with Nikki admitting she's not in love with him and refuses to settle. Telling Richard that the two of them would be very happy together, Richard says regardless of his desires, his life isn't about what he wants.\n\nHearing this, Nikki says she and her fianc\u00e9 are set to move to [[Los Angeles]], with Nikki asking Richard to come to her apartment later to say a \"proper goodbye\". The morning of, he is conflicted. When he gets to Nikki's apartment, he finds her in her underwear in her bathroom. In the moments before it seems Richard will consummate his attraction to Nikki, he realizes how grave the loss of his wife and children would be, so he walks out on Nikki narrating that you can't choose who you love in life, but you can choose how you love. Richard returns home, surprising his wife, and, for the first time in the film, they begin to rebuild a genuine rapport, with a possible promise of good things to come.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Chris Rock]] as Richard Cooper \n*[[Gina Torres]] as Brenda Cooper\n*[[Kerry Washington]] as Nikki Tru\n*[[Steve Buscemi]] as George\n*[[Edward Herrmann]] as Mr. Landis\n*[[Adam LeFevre]] as Maitre'd\n*[[Welker White]] as Tracy\n*Samantha Ivers as Mary\n*[[Michael K.
