[[Tom Stoppard]] wrote the screenplay based on [[John le Carr\u00e9]]'s 1989 [[The Russia House|novel of the same name]]. It was the first US motion picture to be shot substantially on location in the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"variety\" />\n\n==Plot==\nBartholomew \"Barley\" Scott-Blair ([[Sean Connery]]), the head of a British publishing firm, arrives in [[Moscow]] on business. At a writers' retreat near [[Peredelkino]], he speaks of an end to tensions with the West, heard by the mysterious \"Dante\" ([[Klaus Maria Brandauer]]), who demands that Barley promise to do the right thing if the opportunity arises.\n\nA few months later, unable to locate Barley at a trade show, a young Soviet named Katya Orlova ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]) asks publisher Nicky Landau ([[Nicholas Woodeson]]) to give Barley a manuscript. Landau sneaks a look and delivers it to British government authorities. The manuscript is a document detailing the [[Soviet Union]]'s capability for waging nuclear war. An investigation reveals \"Dante\" is renowned Soviet physicist Yakov Efraimovich Saveleyev, author of the manuscript.\n\nBritish intelligence officers track Barley to his holiday flat in [[Lisbon]] and interrogate him about his ties to Katya, but realize he knows as little as they do. [[MI6]] realizes the manuscript is also of vital importance to the [[CIA]], with both agencies seeking Barley to work on their behalf.  British agent Ned ([[James Fox]]) gives Barley some fundamental training as a spy.\n\nBarley returns to the Soviet Union to seek out Dante and confirm he is a genuine informant. He meets with Katya and is instantly smitten. Through her, he confirms that Dante is indeed Saveleyev, and he also denies to Katya that he is a spy.\n\nThe British run the operation through its first phase while apprising the CIA of its results. The CIA team, headed by Russell ([[Roy Scheider]]), is concerned at the manuscript's description of the Soviet nuclear missile programme in complete disarray and suggests the United States has engaged in a pointless arms race.\n\nKatya sets up a meeting with Yakov, going to great lengths to avoid being followed. Barley explains that the manuscript is in the hands of British and American authorities. Yakov feels betrayed, but Barley convinces him that the manuscript can still be published, and is given another volume of the manuscript after assuring Yakov he is sympathetic to the scientist's cause.\n\nImpressed by the additional volume, Russell's boss Brady ([[John Mahoney]]) and U.S. military officer Quinn ([[J. T. Walsh]]) interrogate Barley to be certain of his loyalties. Russell states he would help the British operation out of a true ideological belief in {{lang|ru|glasnost}}, although this would not be good news to his \"customers\" in the weapons industry, who need an arms race for continued prosperity.\n\nConvinced the manuscripts are truthful, the CIA and MI6 create a \"shopping list\" of questions to extract as much strategic warfare information as Dante can provide. \"Russia House\" handler Ned senses something is amiss with Barley, but the British-American team continues its plans.\n\nBarley returns to the Soviet Union and declares his love to Katya, admitting he is an operative. Katya confesses that Yakov is not acting like himself and fears he may be under [[KGB]] observation or control.  She gives Barley Yakov's address in Moscow.\n\nUnder full British-American surveillance, Barley takes the shopping list to Yakov's apartment. Ned suddenly concludes that the Soviets know all about the operation and will steal the list to learn what the British and Americans know, and is convinced that Barley has made a deal to turn over the questions to the KGB. Russell disagrees, and instructs the mission to proceed as planned. The meeting with Yakov is expected to be brief, but after seven hours, Russell admits he was wrong. The team must now pretend the questions were deliberately false.\n\nBarley sends a note to Ned explaining that during a pre-arranged phone call to Katya, Dante used a code word to let her know that he had been compromised by the KGB and that her life was in danger. Barley admits he traded the shopping list to the Soviets, in exchange for the release of Katya and her family to the West. He admits his actions might be unfair, but tells Ned, \"You shouldn't open other people's letters.\"\n\nNed visits Barley, who has returned to his flat in [[Lisbon]], to wait for Katya. When her ship arrives, Barley greets Katya and her family at the docks, ready to begin a new life with them.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as Bartholomew \"Barley\" Scott Blair\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Katya Orlova\n* [[Roy Scheider]] as Russell\n* [[James Fox]] as Ned\n* [[John Mahoney]] as Brady\n* [[Michael Kitchen]] as Clive\n* [[J.
