Reviews were negative, and the film was a box office bomb.\n\n== Plot==\nTommy Collins is an unemployed [[erotic dancing|erotic dancer]] living at his mother's home in a [[trailer park]] while he looks for a decent job. He finds out that his Mother, and her boyfriend Jed, a [[polystyrene]] collector, are going to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to be married and taking the mobile home with them. Although his mother had arranged for Tommy to stay with the Woodalls, he considers them awful people and decides to look for other living arrangements for him and his [[chihuahua (dog)|chihuahua]] Peanut (who loves the game show ''[[Jeopardy!]]'').\n\nHe rummages through the trash and finds his letter for [[jury duty]] that he had thrown away and decides to enter. Each of the jurors get their own free accommodation plus $5 a day. After several cases he gets chosen to be a juror for a murder case involving a man named Carl Wayne Bishop, a fast food employee who had been fired and is now accused of murdering several other fast food employees. The evidence against him gets stronger when several employees appear as witnesses saying that he threatened to kill them.\n\nAll the jurors are staying at the Holiday Suite in the section that is being remodeled. Tommy seems to be enjoying himself, until he finds he is sharing his room with his former high school principal, who puts motivational tapes on at night to full blast. He makes a deal with the manager of the hotel who says that he will get a different room if he advertises their business during news broadcasts. Tommy agrees and ends up staying in a luxurious suite.\n\nFinally the jurors go to the jury room for deliberation and appoint Tommy as their [[Jury foreman|foreman]]. The other jurors immediately think that Bishop is guilty and want to vote straight away. Not wanting to lose his suite and luxurious lifestyle, Tommy votes not guilty and stalls and prolongs the deliberations as well as continuously going over the evidence. After many delays, the other jurors become increasingly angry with Tommy, especially Monica, whom Tommy had fallen in love with, and threaten to throw him out of the jury unless he finds a better way to prove Bishop's innocence.\n\nAfter reading up on the law and further investigating, both of which are activities prohibited under standard instructions to jurors, Tommy finds some evidence after seeing a picture of Carl Wayne Bishop on the window of a store, finally convincing the jurors that Bishop is not guilty; they celebrate. Unfortunately, later on, Monica finds Peanut and follows him up to Tommy's luxury suite, with security guard Murphy following her. Even though Tommy tries to explain that he is now a changed person, she is deeply upset with how he used them and walks out in tears.\n\nLater, the Judge declares a [[mistrial]] and arranges another hearing at a later date. Back at the trailer park, Tommy goes mining for polystyrene with Jed at the city dump. After seeing many polystyrene containers with fast food logos on them, Tommy realizes that the murderer was an [[environmentalist]]. He calls Monica, who immediately hangs up on him, but he goes looking for Frank, another fellow juror, who was also obsessed with the environment. Later that night, someone meets another man named Frank who thanks him for volunteering to do jury duty on his behalf while he was on vacation, only to be killed with a [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun]]. The killer is revealed to be Frank, the man Tommy was seeking. Tommy arrives at the same house and relays his new evidence to Frank, asking him to help find Monica at the library she works at in order to convince her that his evidence is genuine.\n\nWhen they arrive at the library, Frank reveals to Tommy and Monica that he was the killer. He ties them up and attempts to stab them with a sharp jagged knife. He tells them that he committed the terrible murders and framed Carl Wayne Bishop because he thought there was no truth and justice in the world. With Peanut's help, however, they manage to subdue Frank and knock him unconscious.\n\nTommy is given a check for his contribution to the case, and Monica starts dating Tommy. He uses his earnings from erotic dancing towards law school and eventually becomes an [[Attorney at Law|attorney]]. Meanwhile, Peanut is shown accomplishing his lifelong dream of becoming a contestant on ''Jeopardy!''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n*[[Pauly Shore]] as Thomas B. \"Tommy\" Collins\n*Gizmo as Peanut\n*[[Tia Carrere]] as Monica Lewis\n*[[Stanley Tucci]] as Frank/Billy\n*[[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Harry\n*[[Abe Vigoda]] as Judge Edward J.
