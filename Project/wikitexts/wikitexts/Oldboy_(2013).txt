It is a [[remake]]\u2014or as labeled by Lee, a \"reinterpretation\"\u2014of [[Park Chan-wook]]'s 2003 South Korean film [[Oldboy (2003 film)|of the same name]] (which in turn is based on the Japanese manga ''[[Old Boy (manga)|Old Boy]]''), and follows a man who searches for his captors after being mysteriously imprisoned for twenty years. It stars [[Josh Brolin]], [[Elizabeth Olsen]], and [[Sharlto Copley]].\n\n''Oldboy'' was released in the United States on November 27, 2013, by [[FilmDistrict]]. It received a mixed reception from critics, with many finding the film inferior to the classic.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|date=November 2022}}\nIn 1993, [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] advertising executive Joe Doucett gets drunk after losing a major account because he insulted his client\u2019s girlfriend. Before he passes out, he sees a woman with a yellow umbrella selling souvenirs on the street. When he wakes up, he finds himself locked in what appears to be a hotel room. His unseen captors provide him food, alcohol, and personal hygiene items, but do not explain why he is held captive. Joe sees a news report saying his ex-wife Donna has been raped and murdered and that he is the prime suspect. He learns their 3-year-old daughter Mia was adopted through the welfare system and is now a [[cello]] prodigy.\n\nOver the next 20 years, Joe quits drinking and gets into shape, intent on escaping and getting revenge. He compiles a list of all those who might want to imprison him, and writes letters to eventually be given to Mia. One day he watches a televised interview of Mia, who says she would forgive her father if she ever saw him.\n\nShortly after, Joe is drugged. He wakes up outside in a trunk in a field, with a [[Mobile phone|cell phone]] and a small amount of money. He spots the woman with the yellow umbrella and runs after her. He loses her but encounters Marie Sebastian, a nurse who offers to help; he refuses the help, but takes her business card. Joe goes to the bar of his friend Chucky and explains what has happened to him, before receiving a call on his cell phone from a man calling himself the \"Stranger\", who mocks him. After failing to identify the caller, Joe collapses from dehydration, and Chucky calls Marie to help. While he recovers, Marie is moved emotionally by Joe's letters to Mia and offers to help him further. She helps him identify a [[Chinese restaurant]] which supplied his food while he was held captive.\n\nJoe follows a delivery from the restaurant to a warehouse where he was imprisoned, and meets Chaney, its owner. Joe tortures Chaney by [[flaying]] his neck with a [[utility knife]]; Chaney confesses that the Stranger arranged for Joe's captivity. Upon returning to Chucky's bar, Joe finds the Stranger there with the woman with the yellow umbrella, his bodyguard Haeng-bok. The Stranger says they have kidnapped Mia, but he makes an offer: if Joe can determine the Stranger's identity and the reason for his 20-year captivity within the next 46 hours, he will release Mia, give Joe $20 million in diamonds, release evidence proving Joe's innocence in Donna's murder, and commit suicide.\n\nJoe learns that Chaney and his men are seeking revenge by attacking Marie. After racing to her house, he is captured by Chaney. Just as Chaney is about to torture Joe, the Stranger calls Chaney and offers to pay him for Joe and Marie's release; Chaney obliges. Using a music recognition app on her phone, Marie determines that the ringtone from the Stranger's call is the theme song of Evergreen Academy, a now-closed school that Joe attended.\n\nMarie visits the school headmistress's home, while Joe sneaks in a back door and finds his yearbook where he recognizes a student, Adrian Doyle Pryce. Joe passes the name to Chucky and hides Marie in a hotel for her safety. There they have passionate sex, unaware that the Stranger (actually Adrian) is watching through [[Hidden camera|hidden cameras]]. Chucky, researching Adrian on the internet, learns everything has been about Adrian's sister, Amanda, and leaves Joe a message informing him; however, Adrian intercepts and deletes the message before Joe can hear it, and [[garrotes]] Chucky to death with [[piano wire]] for insulting Amanda. Marie and Joe enter the Evergreen Academy grounds and find the school's records regarding Adrian and Amanda. Joe recalls bullying Amanda and seeing Amanda having sex with an older man, [[Incest|revealed to be her own father]], in the school's greenhouse. When others at Evergreen learned what happened, Adrian's father moved the Pryce family to [[Luxembourg]], where he later murdered his wife and Amanda, and attempted to murder Adrian, before killing himself. Back at the car, they find a package with Chucky's tongue inside. Joe makes Marie promise to let him go after Adrian alone.\n\nJoe goes to Adrian's [[Penthouse apartment|penthouse]], kills Haeng-bok by slitting her throat, and confronts Adrian. He tells Adrian what he learned about Amanda and Adrian's father, and Adrian congratulates him for answering the questions correctly. Adrian, who believes his father's abuse was an expression of love, blames the destruction of his family on Joe, who revealed their secret by telling everyone at Evergreen what he saw in the greenhouse. Adrian gives Joe the diamonds and evidence, and escorts him to the sets used to fabricate the media watched by Joe in captivity. Adrian taunts Joe by questioning why he was released at all, and shows that the interview with \"Mia\" was a setup; the girl, now a woman, was a paid actress. He reveals that Marie is actually Joe's own daughter Mia, and that he wanted Joe to know what it felt like to lose everything. Adrian then shoots himself in the mouth, killing himself.\n\nHorrified, Joe writes Marie a letter saying they can never see each other again. He leaves her most of the diamonds, using the rest to pay Chaney to return him to the captivity of the hotel room, presumably for the rest of his life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Josh Brolin]] as Joe Doucett\n** [[Grey Damon]] as young Joe Doucett\n* [[Elizabeth Olsen]] as Marie Sebastian\n* Elvy Yost as \"Mia Doucett\"\n* [[Sharlto Copley]] as Adrian Doyle Pryce / The Stranger\n** Erik Gersovitz as young Adrian Pryce\n* [[Samuel L.
