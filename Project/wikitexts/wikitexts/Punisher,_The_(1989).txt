Instead the character uses the knife with the skull. Shot in [[Sydney]], Australia, ''The Punisher'' co-stars [[Jeroen Krabb\u00e9]], [[Kim Miyori]], [[Nancy Everhard]], and [[Barry Otto]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Punisher|Frank Castle]] is a former undercover police detective and [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] whose wife Julie was killed five years ago, along with their two daughters, by a [[American Mafia|Mafia]] car bomb intended for Frank who is also presumed to be dead. Castle has since become the city's most wanted, and most mysterious, vigilante - known only as \"[[The Punisher]]\". He now lives in the labyrinthine sewer-system of NYC, having assassinated 125 mobsters (not counting henchmen) in the past half-decade. His work is known by the use of special throwing-knives engraved with a skull. Castle's sole ally in his one-man war against organized crime is Shake (taken from [[Shakespeare]] and \"the shakes\"), a stage-performer-turned derelict who typically speaks in rhyme.\n\nThe underworld families have become so weakened by the Punisher's guerrilla warfare that kingpin Gianni Franco is forced out of retirement. Franco plans to unify the decimated families. However, this attracts unwanted attention from the [[Yakuza]], Asia's most powerful crime syndicate. Led by Lady Tanaka, the Yakuza decide to take over the Mafia families and all of their interests. In order to sway the mobsters to their cause, they kidnap their children and hold them for ransom.\n\nShake pleads with the Punisher to save the children, who are likely to be sold into the Arab slave trade regardless of whether the Mafia give into the demands. The Punisher attacks Yakuza businesses, warning that for every day the children are held in captivity, he will inflict heavy costs on them in property damage. The Yakuza later capture the Punisher and Shake and attempt to torture them into submission, but the Punisher breaks free and decides the only course of action is a direct rescue.\n\nHe is able to save most of the children and commandeers a bus to get the kidnapped children to safety. However prior to this Tommy Franco, the son of Gianni Franco, had been taken away to Yakuza headquarters. When driving the busload of kids, the Punisher runs into a police roadblock and is arrested. While in custody Castle is reunited with one of his old partners, who warns his multiple killings will likely get him executed, however at a later point Castle is broken out of jail by Franco's men. Franco admits he brought this on himself as the hit on Castle's family was an error, and persuades the Punisher to help him save his son. Castle agrees to work with his old enemy for the sake of stopping the [[Yakuza|Japanese criminal underworld]] from taking root in America.\n\nFranco and the Punisher raid the Yakuza headquarters, fight and kill all the Yakuza, including Lady Tanaka and her daughter. Upon being reunited with his son, Franco betrays the Punisher, but the Punisher defends himself and kills Franco. Franco's son Tommy then threatens the Punisher for killing his father, but cannot bring himself to take revenge. Castle warns Leonard's son to \"stay a good boy, and grow up to be a good man\", not following his father's misdeeds. He also warns he will return should the boy commit any crimes, then disappears. The police arrive, only to find no trace of the Punisher. Meanwhile, at his lair, Castle narrates that he'll be waiting \"in the shadows.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Dolph Lundgren]] as [[Punisher|Francis \"Frank\" Castle / The Punisher]]\n* [[Louis Gossett Jr.]] as Detective Jake Berkowitz\n* [[Jeroen Krabb\u00e9]] as Gianni Franco\n* [[Kim Miyori]] as Lady Tanaka\n* [[Bryan Marshall]] as Dino Moretti\n* [[Nancy Everhard]] as Detective Samantha \"Sam\" Leary\n* [[Barry Otto]] as \"Shake\"\n* [[Brian Rooney (actor)|Brian Rooney]] as Tommy Franco\n* Zoska Aleece as Tanaka's Daughter (Zoshka Mizak)\n* [[Larry McCormick (TV)|Larry McCormick]] as TV Newsreader\n* Kenji Yamaki as Sato, Tanaka's Bodyguard\n* [[Todd Boyce]] as Tarrone\n* Hirofumi Kanayama as Tomio, Tanaka's Bodyguard\n* [[Lani Tupu|Lani John Tupu]] as Laccone\n* Giancarlo Negroponte as Musso\n* May Lloyd as Julie Castle \n* Brooke Anderson as Annie Castle\n* Holly Rogers as Felice Castle\n* [[Char Fontane]] as Laurie Silver\n* Isao Hirata as Ito\n* Brett Williams as Tim\n* David Arnett as Joe\n* [[Donal Gibson]] as Bill\n* Lawrence Woodward as Mickey\n* Johnny Raaen as Joey\n* Robert Simper as Danny\n* Brian McDermott as O'Banion\n* Colin Leong as Cutter Captain\n* [[Christian Manon]] as French Leader\n* Fotis Pelekis as Mario\n* James Klein as Nicholas\n* Robert Fraser as Robert\n* Dominic Baudish as Dominic\n* Cathy Stirk as Caterina\n* Emily Nicol as Cathy\n* Courtney Keiler as Sophia\n* Noga Bernstein as Ginny\n* Emma Soloman as Ginny's Girlfriend\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{Anchor|Casting}}\n[[Christopher Lambert]] was the original choice for the role of Frank Castle.

A [[Compact disc|CD]] of the [[soundtrack]] was not released until July 19, 2005 ([[Perseverance Records]], PRD006). The CD includes the complete multi-track stereo recording, as well as a 22-minutes interview with the composer Dennis Dreith and the director Mark Goldblatt. Perseverance Records also released a new 5.1 mix as a SACD, in collaboration with [http://www.tarantula-records.com/ Tarantula Records] (TARAN001). The American DVD release only contains a monaural (single track) soundtrack, despite the film being mixed in Dolby Stereo. The 2013 German and UK Blu-ray/DVD editions were presented with 2.0 and 5.1 (Dolby Digital and DTS-HD MA) sound tracks although the UK disc was made from mono tracks.\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\nThe film was given a worldwide theatrical release, except in the United States, Sweden, and South Africa.<ref name=\"dolph\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dolph-ultimate.com/films/punisher.html |title=The Punisher|work=Dolph-ultimate.com |access-date=June 29, 2010}}</ref> The film was originally slated for a US release in August 1989, as trailers were created by New World promoting the film. The film premiered in Germany and France in October 1989 and it was shown months later at the Los Angeles Comic Book and Sci-fi Convention in July 1990. However, the film never received a wide theatrical release in the United States due to New World's financial difficulties and its new owners not having an interest in theatrical distribution.\n\n===Home media===\nIt was sold to Live Entertainment (now Lionsgate) who released it direct-to-video on VHS and Laserdisc in April 1991.
