The storyline of obsession somewhat resembles that of ''[[Death in Venice]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nGiles De'Ath ([[John Hurt]]) is a British writer who doesn't use or understand anything modern. One day, he forgets his keys and locks himself out of his flat. It begins to rain, so he goes to see an [[E. M. Forster]] movie but, instead, accidentally enters the wrong theatre and sees the [[teen film]] ''Hotpants College II'' starring Ronnie Bostock ([[Jason Priestley]]). He becomes instantly infatuated with Ronnie's beauty and becomes obsessed with the young actor. He goes to his movies in the cinema, buys [[teen magazine]]s and cuts out pictures of him, and buys a VCR and TV in order to play rented video tapes of his movies. He lets his housekeeper come into his office less and less, so that he can do these things undisturbed.\n\nAs his infatuation grows, it becomes obvious to those around him that Giles is becoming increasingly disturbed, though they don't know why. His friend and agent suggests that he take a holiday.\n\nGiles sets out to meet Ronnie on [[Long Island]]. He flies to Long Island and takes a train to Ronnie's home town where he takes a motel room for several weeks. He searches the town for Ronnie - unsuccessfully at first - but finally spots Ronnie's girlfriend and follows her to the supermarket. Giles rams his shopping cart into her to force an introduction and invents a story about his god-daughter, Abigail, being in love with Ronnie. The girlfriend, Audrey (Fiona Loewi), is seemingly glad to have found a fan-base for Ronnie in England, and spends the day talking to Giles. She then tells him that she and Ronnie will invite him over at another time, and they can talk about Ronnie's career.\n\nEventually Giles becomes a regular visitor at Ronnie and Audrey's house. Ronnie is flattered by Giles, and Giles is able to stay longer in his presence by claiming that he will write a new script for Ronnie, one that better suits his acting abilities. Audrey becomes suspicious of Giles's motives regarding Ronnie, and she tells Giles that she is taking Ronnie to see her parents for an extended visit. Giles is very upset, and in a last-ditch effort confronts Ronnie and tells him how he feels about him. He says that many artists have had younger male lovers, and that Ronnie should split up with Audrey because it is obvious to him (Giles) that it won't last. Ronnie rejects Giles but seems genuinely concerned for him. The film ends with a screening of Ronnie's next film: another ''Hotpants College'' movie where he quotes Walt Whitman at his mother's funeral as written by Giles. What happens to Giles in the end is not shown.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[John Hurt]] - Giles De'Ath\n* [[Jason Priestley]] - Ronnie Bostock\n* [[Fiona Loewi]] - Audrey\n* [[Sheila Hancock]] - Mrs. Barker\n* [[Harvey Atkin]] - Lou\n* [[Gawn Grainger]] - Henry\n* [[Elizabeth Quinn]] - Mrs. Reed\n* [[Maury Chaykin]] - Irving 'Irv' Buckmuller\n* [[Linda Busby]] - Mrs. Abbott\n* [[Bill Leadbitter]] - Eldridge\n* [[Anne Reid]] - Maureen (as Ann Reid)\n* [[Danny Webb (actor)|Danny Webb]] - Video Assistant (as Daniel Webb)\n* [[Andrew Barrow (actor)|Andrew Barrow]] - Harry\n* [[Dean Gariss]] - Rob\n* [[Robert McKewley]] - Video Salesman\n\n== Production ==\nThe film has a musical score by [[Startled Insects|Richard Grassby-Lewis]].

What makes it perhaps even better than Adair\u2019s clever novel...is the beautiful balance of humane sympathies Kwietniowski achieves; at no point does the foolishness or vanity of either character wipe out our sense of his dignity, and Fiona Loewi is no less touching as the movie star\u2019s girlfriend.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jonathanrosenbaum.net/2021/03/love-and-death-on-long-island/|title=Love and Death on Long Island}}</ref> And Mark Caro of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' also gave the film three and a half stars and called it \"a bewitching comedy about what happens when Giles opens himself up to the modern world -- and his own sexual inclinations,\" adding that it's \"charming, caustic, touching and vaguely creepy.\" Caro singled out Hurt for capturing \"the ridiculousness of Giles' mission without ever sacrificing his dignity. It's a performance in which you marvel at the details: the contrast between his haughty manner outside and his private embarrassed laughter as he watches a Bostock video in which a biker is catapulted into a manure pile; his startled reaction to a car that robotically warns, \"You are standing too close to this vehicle\"; the way he flinches when a close-up of a mortally wounded Bostock character cuts to a shot of a priest, as if Giles had forgotten that the precious image on his TV screen was not fixed there.\" Caro also lauded director Kwietniowski for showing \"a gentle touch in portraying Giles' folly and satirizing British stuffiness and American anti-intellectualism.\"<ref>http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-03-13/entertainment/9803130060_1_giles-de-ath-kwietniowski-ronnie-bostock {{Dead link|date=February 2022}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film grossed $78,151 in its opening weekend, the number one exclusive release in New York and Los Angeles for the weekend.<ref name=open>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|last=Roman|first=Monica|title='Love and Death on L.I.' tops exclusives|page=21|date=March 10, 1998}}</ref><ref name=weekend>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|title=Film box office report|page=50|date=March 10, 1998}}</ref> It went on to gross $2,581,012 at the box office in the United States and Canada.<ref name=\"BOM\">{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=loveanddeathonlongisland.htm|title=Love and Death on Long Island (1998)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=July 8, 2011}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the film grossed \u00a30.4 million ($0.7 million).<ref name=ukgross>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=14 December 1998|page=72|title=British biz at the box office}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0119574|title=Love and Death on Long Island}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Love And Death On Long Island}}\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:English-language Canadian films]]\n[[Category:1997 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films set in Long Island]]\n[[Category:British independent films]]\n[[Category:British LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Canadian LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Richard Kwietniowski]]\n[[Category:Lionsgate films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Nova Scotia]]\n[[Category:1997 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:British drama films]]\n[[Category:Canadian independent films]]\n[[Category:1997 independent films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s Canadian films]]\n[[Category:1990s British films]]"}]}}}}
