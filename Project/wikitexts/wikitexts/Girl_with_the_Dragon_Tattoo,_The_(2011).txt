It was directed by [[David Fincher]] with a screenplay by [[Steven Zaillian]]. Starring [[Daniel Craig]] as journalist [[Mikael Blomkvist]] and [[Rooney Mara]] as [[Lisbeth Salander]], it tells the story of Blomkvist's investigation to find out what happened to a girl from a wealthy family who disappeared 40 years prior. He recruits the help of Salander, a computer hacker.\n\n[[Sony Pictures]] Entertainment began development on the film, a co-production of the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden and Germany, in 2009. It took the company a few months to obtain the rights to the novel, while also recruiting Zaillian and Fincher. The casting process for the lead roles was exhaustive and intense; Craig faced scheduling conflicts, and a number of actresses were sought for the role of Lisbeth Salander. The script took over six months to write, which included three months of analyzing the novel.\n\nThe film premiered at [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in London on December 12, 2011. A critical and commercial success, the film grossed $232.6&nbsp;million on a $90&nbsp;million budget and received highly positive reviews from critics, who praised Craig and Mara's performances as well as the film's somber tone. The film was chosen by [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2011#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2011]] and was a candidate for numerous awards, winning, among others, the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]],<ref name=Oscars>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/84/nominees.html|title=84th Academy Award winners|access-date=September 20, 2013|archive-date=August 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825202636/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/84/nominees.html|url-status=live}}</ref> while Mara's performance earned her an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2012|title=The 84th Academy Awards {{!}} 2012|work=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|access-date=2017-06-11|language=en|archive-date=April 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417095424/https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Film summaries must be less than 700 words long. -->\nIn [[Stockholm]], [[journalist]] [[Mikael Blomkvist]] is recovering from the legal and professional fallout of a [[defamation|libel]] suit brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerstr\u00f6m. The wealthy Henrik Vanger offers Blomkvist evidence against Wennerstr\u00f6m in exchange for an unusual task: investigate the 40-year-old disappearance and presumed murder of Henrik's grandniece, 16-year-old Harriet. Every year, Vanger receives a framed pressed flower, the same type she always gave him on his birthday before disappearing. He believes her killer is taunting him. Blomkvist moves into a cottage on the Vanger family estate on Hedestad Island.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Lisbeth Salander]] is a young, brilliant asocial investigator and [[Security hacker|hacker]] whose state-appointed guardian suffers a stroke. He is replaced by Nils Bjurman, a sadist who controls Salander's finances and extorts sexual favors by threatening to have her institutionalized. Unaware she is recording him, Bjurman chains Salander to his bed and brutally rapes her. At their next meeting, Salander tasers Bjurman, binds him, rapes him with a [[dildo]], and tattoos \"I'm a rapist pig\" across his chest. Using the secret recording she made, she blackmails him into securing her financial independence and having no further contact with her.\n\nBlomkvist explores the island and interviews Vanger's relatives, learning some were [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] sympathizers during [[World War II]]. He uncovers a list of names and numbers that turn out to be Bible verse references, and recruits Salander as his research assistant. She discovers a connection between the list and numerous young women brutally murdered from 1947 to 1967, indicating a serial killer. Many of the victims have Jewish names, making her theorize that the murders could have been motivated by [[antisemitism]]. One morning, Blomkvist finds the mutilated corpse of his cat on the doorstep. Another night, a bullet grazes his forehead; after Salander tends his wounds, they have sex. The pair learn that Harriet's late father, Gottfried, and later Martin, her brother, committed the murders.\n\nWhile looking for more proof, Blomkvist gets caught by Martin and forced into a specially prepared basement. There, Blomkvist is gassed unconscious and placed in restraints. Martin brags about killing and raping women for decades, like his father, but admits to not knowing what happened to Harriet. Blomkvist is about to get killed when Salander arrives, attacks Martin and forces him to flee. She pursues him on her motorcycle until he runs off the road and hits a [[propane]] tank, blowing up the car and killing him. Salander nurses Blomkvist back to health and reveals that, as a child, she was institutionalized after attempting to burn her father alive.\n\nThey deduce that Harriet is alive and in hiding; traveling to London, they find her. Harriet reveals that Gottfried sexually abused her when she was 14 for an entire year before she was able to defend herself, accidentally killing him in the process. Martin continued the abuse after Gottfried's death. Her cousin, Anita, smuggled her off the island and let Harriet assume her identity in London, though Anita and her husband were later killed in a car accident. Finally free of her brother, Harriet returns to Sweden and tearfully reunites with Henrik.\n\nAs promised, Henrik gives Blomkvist information against Wennerstr\u00f6m, but it proves to be outdated and useless. Salander reveals that she has hacked Wennerstr\u00f6m's accounts and discovered that he is laundering money for various criminal syndicates. She gives Blomkvist evidence of Wennerstr\u00f6m's crimes, which Blomkvist publishes in a scathing editorial, ruining Wennerstr\u00f6m and bringing Blomkvist to national prominence. Salander, in disguise, travels to Switzerland and removes two billion euros from Wennerstr\u00f6m's secret accounts. Wennerstr\u00f6m is later murdered in an apparent gangland shooting.\n\nOn her way to give Blomkvist a Christmas present, Salander sees him and his married lover, Erika Berger, being affectionate. She discards the gift and rides away on her motorbike.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[Mikael Blomkvist]]: A co-owner for Swedish magazine ''Millennium'', Blomkvist is devoted to exposing the corruptions and malfeasance of government, attracting infamy for his tendency to \"go too far\".<ref name=filming>{{cite web|url=http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies_2011/girl_with_dragon/notes.pdf|title=The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: Production Notes|publisher=Visual Hollywood|access-date=June 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002202741/http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies_2011/girl_with_dragon/notes.pdf|archive-date=October 2, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Craig competed with [[George Clooney]], [[Johnny Depp]], [[Viggo Mortensen]], and [[Brad Pitt]] as candidates for the role.<ref name=entd3>{{cite magazine|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/06/17/girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo/|title=This week's cover: The secrets of 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo'|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=June 17, 2010|access-date=June 30, 2012|archive-date=November 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110022853/http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/06/17/girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=hollzgirl>{{cite web| last=Kilday| first=Greg| url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-rooney-mara-281904| title=The Making of 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo'| work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]| date=January 24, 2012| access-date=June 30, 2012| archive-date=May 1, 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501104544/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-rooney-mara-281904| url-status=live}}</ref> Initial concerns over schedule conflicts with the production of ''[[Cowboys & Aliens]]'' (2011) and ''[[Skyfall]]'' (2012) prompted Craig to postpone the casting process.<ref name=hollzgirl/><ref name=deadline/> Given the uncertainty surrounding ''Skyfall'' following [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s bankruptcy, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] and [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] worked out a schedule and Craig agreed to take the part.<ref name=deadline>{{cite news |last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=https://www.deadline.com/2010/07/daniel-craig-closes-deal-for-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo |title=Daniel Craig Closes Deal For 'The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo' |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=July 26, 2010 |access-date=May 30, 2011 |archive-date=July 23, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723053313/http://www.deadline.com/2010/07/daniel-craig-closes-deal-for-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The British actor was required to gain weight and adopted a neutral accent to befit Stockholm's worldly cultural fabric.

Bjurman's multifaceted psyche was the main reason Van Wageningen wanted to play the role. The Dutch actor said, \"This character goes through a lot and I wasn't quite sure I wanted to go through all that. I started out half way between the elation of getting to work with David Fincher and the dread of this character, but I was able to use both of those things.

To portray Larsson's vision of Sweden, and the interaction of light on its landscape, Fincher cooperated with an artistic team that included cinematographer [[Jeff Cronenweth]] and production designer [[Donald Graham Burt]]. The film was wholly shot using [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company]]'s RED MX digital camera, chosen to help evoke Larsson's tone. The idea, according to Cronenweth, was to employ unorthodox light sources and maintain a realistic perspective. \"So there may be shadows, there may be flaws, but it's reality. You allow silhouettes and darkness, but at the same time we also wanted shots to counter that, so it would not all be one continuous dramatic image.\"<ref name=filming/> Sweden's climate was a crucial element in enhancing the mood. Cronenweth commented, \"It's always an element in the background and it was very important that you feel it as an audience member. The winter becomes like a silent character in the film giving everything a low, cool-colored light that is super soft and non-direct.\"<ref name=filming/> To get acquainted with Swedish culture, Burt set out on a month-long expedition across the country. He said of the process, \"It takes time to start really taking in the nuances of a culture, to start seeing the themes that recur in the architecture, the landscape, the layouts of the cities and the habits of the people. I felt I had to really integrate myself into this world to develop a true sense of place for the film.

It was arduous for Miller to conceptualize the sequence abstractly, given that Salander's occupation was a distinctive part of her personality. His initial ideas were modeled after a keyboard. \"We were going to treat the keyboard like this giant city with massive fingers pressing down on the keys,\" Miller explained, \"Then we transitioned to the liquid going through the giant obelisks of the keys.\"<ref name=i0/> Among Miller's many vignettes was \"The Hacker Inside\", which revealed the character's inner disposition and melted them away. The futuristic qualities in the original designs provided for a much more [[cyberpunk]] appearance than the final product. In creating the \"cyber\" look for Salander, Miller said, \"Every time I would show David a design he would say, 'More Tandy!' It's the shitty little computers from Radio Shack, the [[Tandy Corporation#Computers|Tandy computers]]. They probably had vacuum tubes in them, really old technology. And David would go 'More Tandy', until we ended up with something that looked like we glued a bunch of computer parts found at a junkyard together.\"<ref name=i0>{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/5873372/an-exclusive-look-at-the-making-of-dragon-tattoos-stunning-titles|title=An Exclusive Look at the Making of Dragon Tattoo's Stunning Titles|first=Meredith|last=Woerner|publisher=[[io9]]|date=January 5, 2012|access-date=July 2, 2012|archive-date=June 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620144458/http://io9.com/5873372/an-exclusive-look-at-the-making-of-dragon-tattoos-stunning-titles|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFincher wanted the vignette to be a \"personal nightmare\" for Salander, replaying her darkest moments. \"Early on, we knew it was supposed to feel like a nightmare,\" Miller professed, who commented that early on in the process, Fincher wanted to use an artwork as a template for the sequence. After browsing through various paintings to no avail, Fincher chose a painting that depicted the artist, covered in black paint, standing in the middle of a gallery. Many of Miller's sketches contained a liquid-like component, and were rewritten to produce the \"gooey\" element that was so desired. \"David said let's just put liquid in all of them and it will be this primordial dream ooze that's a part of every vignette,\" Miller recalled. \"It ties everything together other than the black on black.\"<ref name=i0/>\n\nThe title sequence includes abundant references to the novel, and exposes several political themes. Salander's tattoos, such as her phoenix and dragon tattoos, were incorporated. The multiple flower representations signified the [[biological life cycle]], as well as Henrik, who received a pressed flower each year on his birthday. \"One had flowers coming out of this black ooze,\" said Fincher, \"it blossoms, and then it dies. And then a different flower, as that one is dying is rising from the middle of it. It was supposed to represent this cycle of the killer sending flowers.\"<ref name=i0/> Ultimately, the vignette becomes very conceptual because Miller and his team took \"a whole thought, and cut it up into multiple different shots that are mixed in with other shots\". In one instance, Blomkvist is strangled by strips of newspaper, a metaphor for the establishment squelching his exposes.<ref name=i0/>\n\nIn the \"Hot Hands\" vignette, a pair of rough, distorted hands that embrace Salander's face and melt it represent all that's bad in men. The hands that embrace Blomkvist's face and shatter it, represent wealth and power.<ref name=i0/> Themes of [[domestic violence]] become apparent as a woman's face shatters after a merciless beating; this also ties in the brutal beating of Salander's mother by her father, an event revealed in the sequel, ''[[The Girl Who Played with Fire]]'' (2006).<ref name=\"i0\" />\n\nA cover of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s \"[[Immigrant Song]]\" (1970) plays throughout the title sequence.
