It stars Jude Law, [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], and [[Angelina Jolie]]. It is an example of \"Ottensian\" (pre-WWII) ''[[dieselpunk]]''.<ref name=\"Discovering Dieselpunk p3\">{{Citation |url=http://www.ottens.co.uk/gatehouse/Gazette%20-%201.pdf|title=Discovering Dieselpunk |last1=Piecraft |first2=Nick |last2=Ottens |journal=The Gatehouse Gazette |issue=1 |date=July 2008 |pages=4, 8, 9 |access-date=2012-10-17}}</ref>\n\nConran spent four years making a [[black and white]] teaser using a [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] set up in his living room and a [[Macintosh IIci]]. He was able to show it to Avnet, who was so impressed that Avnet spent two years working with him on his screenplay. No major studio was interested, but Avnet convinced [[Aurelio De Laurentiis]] to finance ''Sky Captain'' without a distribution deal (a worldwide distribution deal would later happen with [[Paramount Pictures]]).\n\nAlmost 100 digital artists, modelers, animators, and compositors created the multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for the live-action footage, while the entire film was sketched out via hand-drawn storyboards and then recreated as [[Computer graphics|CGI]] [[animatics]]. Ten months prior to shooting the live-action scenes, Conran first shot them with stand-ins in Los Angeles, then converted that footage to animatics so the actors could accurately envision the film.\n\n''Sky Captain'' received largely positive reviews, particularly for the style of filming that was used; some criticism was directed at the plot and characterization. Despite being a box office flop, generating only $58 million on a $70 million budget, the film has since gained a following and is regarded as a [[cult film|cult classic]]. It was one of the first major films, along with ''[[Casshern (film)|Casshern]]'', ''[[Immortal (2004 film)|Immortal]]'' (both 2004) and ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'' (2005), to be shot entirely on a \"[[digital backlot]]\", blending actors with CG surroundings.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a technologically advanced 1939, the [[zeppelin]] ''Hindenburg III'' moors itself atop the [[Empire State Building]]. Aboard the airship is Dr. Jorge Vargas, a scientist who arranges for a package containing two vials to be delivered to Dr. Walter Jennings. Afterwards, Dr. Vargas vanishes.\n\nPolly Perkins, a reporter for ''The Chronicle'', is looking into the disappearances of Vargas and five other renowned scientists. A cryptic message leads her to [[Radio City Music Hall]], against the warnings of her editor, Mr. Paley, where she meets Dr. Jennings during a showing of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]].'' He tells her that a Dr. Totenkopf is coming for him next. Suddenly, mysterious giant robots attack the city. The authorities call for \"Sky Captain\" Joe Sullivan, the city's hero, Perkins' former lover, and the commander of the private air force the Flying Legion. While Joe engages the robots with his modified [[Curtiss P-40]] pursuit fighter, Perkins photographs from the street with little regard for her safety. He eventually manages to disable one robot; the rest leave thereafter. News reports show similar attacks around the globe. The disabled robot is taken back to the Legion's air base so that technology expert Dex can examine it. Polly follows and persuades Joe to reluctantly let her in on the investigation. Her information takes them to the ransacked laboratory of a dying Dr. Jennings, while an assassin escapes. Just before he dies, Jennings gives Polly the two vials and states that they are crucial to Totenkopf's plans. Polly hides the vials and withholds the information from Joe. They return to the Legion's base just before it comes under attack from squadrons of [[ornithopter]] drones. Dex tracks the origin of the signal controlling the drones and notes it on a map before his capture.\n\nJoe and Polly find Dex's map and fly to [[Nepal]] and then [[Tibet]], where they discover an abandoned mining outpost and meet Joe's old friend Kaji. Two guides working for Totenkopf force Polly to turn over the vials, locking the duo in a room full of dynamite. Joe and Polly manage to escape just before the room explodes, knocking them unconscious and destroying most of Polly's film. They wake up together in the mythical [[Shangri-La]]. The Tibetan-speaking monks there tell of Totenkopf's enslavement of their people, forcing them to work in the uranium mines. Most were killed by the radiation, but the final survivor provides a clue to where Dr. Totenkopf is hiding. With insufficient fuel to make it there, they run into a [[Royal Navy]] [[Airborne aircraft carrier|flying aircraft carrier]] commanded by another of Joe's former flames, Commander Franky Cook. Franky leads the attack on Totenkopf's island lair while Joe and Polly enter through an underwater inlet. Joe and Polly find themselves on an island with dinosaur-like creatures, which Polly hesitates to photograph as she has only two shots left. They find a secret subterranean facility in a mountain, where robots are loading animals, as well as the mysterious vials, onto a large \"[[Noah's Ark]]\" rocket. Joe and Polly are detected but Dex, piloting a flying barge, arrives with three of the missing scientists. They explain that Totenkopf has given up on humanity and seeks to start the world over again: the \"World of Tomorrow\". The vials are genetic material for a new [[Adam and Eve]]; if the rocket reaches space, the afterburners will ignite the atmosphere and kill everyone on Earth.\n\nAs the group attempts to enter Dr. Totenkopf's lair, one scientist is electrocuted by the defense system. A hologram of Totenkopf appears, speaking of his hate for humanity and his plans to rebuild it as a new master race. Dex disables the lair's defenses and the group discovers Totenkopf's mummified corpse inside with a scrap of paper clutched in his hand: \"forgive me\". He died 20 years previously, but his machines have continued his plan. Joe decides to sabotage the rocket from the inside while the others escape. Polly tries to tag along but Joe kisses her and then knocks her out. Polly recovers, following Joe and saving him from Dr. Jennings' assassin, a female robot. Joe and Polly then board the rocket. Before the rocket reaches 100&nbsp;km, when its second stage is scheduled to fire and thereby incinerate the Earth, Polly pushes an emergency button that ejects all the animals in escape pods. Joe tries to disable the rocket only to be interrupted by the same assassin robot. He jolts the robot with its electric weapon and then uses it on the controls, disabling the rocket. Joe and Polly use the last pod to save themselves as the rocket explodes. Joe and Polly watch the animal pods splash down around their escape pod, while Commander Cook leads a group of flying aircraft carriers towards them. Polly then uses the last shot on her camera to take a picture of Joe rather than the animal pods. Joe notes that she had forgotten to take the lens cap off.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jude Law]] as Joseph Sullivan/Sky Captain: He commands a private air force known as the ''Flying Legion''. His personal aircraft is a modified [[Curtiss P-40]]. In 2002, producer Jon Avnet showed Law the [[teaser trailer]] and the actor was very impressed by what he saw. He remembers, \"All I got at that early stage was that he'd used pretty advanced and unused technology to create a very retrospective look.\"<ref name=\"Murray, Rebecca\">{{cite news\n | last        = Murray\n | first       = Rebecca\n | title       = Sky Captain Himself Discusses ''Sky Captain''\n | work        = About Entertainment\n | url         = http://movies.about.com/od/theworldoftomorrow/a/skyjude072404.htm\n | access-date  = April 2, 2007\n | url-status     = dead\n | archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071105052735/http://movies.about.com/od/theworldoftomorrow/a/skyjude072404.htm\n | archive-date = November 5, 2007\n | df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref> Avnet gave him the script to read and some preliminary artwork to look at. Law said \"What was clear was also that at the center was a really great cinematic relationship, which you could put into any genre and it would work. You know, the kind of bickering [relationship]. I always like to call it ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' meets ''[[Buck Rogers]]''.\"<ref name=\"Murray, Rebecca\"/> Avnet wanted to work with Law because he knew that the actor had \"worked both period, who worked both having theatrical experience, who worked on blue screen, who hadn't hit yet as a major action star.\"<ref name=\"Murray, Rebecca, Sky Captain\"/> Law had just finished filming ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'' (2003) and was intrigued by switching from on-location filming to filming completely on a soundstage. ''Sky Captain'' would be one of three Jude Law films released by Paramount Pictures in 2004, along with the remake of ''[[Alfie (2004 film)|Alfie]]'' (2004) and ''[[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'' (2004). It also was one of six overall Jude Law films released that year.\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as Polly Perkins, reporter for the ''New York Chronicle''. Law believed so much in Conran's movie that he became one of the producers and used his clout to get Paltrow involved. Once she was suggested for the role, Law did not remember \"any other name coming up. It just seems that she was perfect. She was as enthusiastic about the script and about the visual references that were sort of put to her, and jumped on board.\"<ref name=\"Murray, Rebecca, Sky Captain\"/> Paltrow said in an interview, \"I thought that this is the time to do a movie like this where it's kind of breaking into new territory and it's not your basic formulaic action-adventure movie.\"<ref name=\"Douglas, Edward, part 3\">{{cite news\n | last = Douglas\n | first = Edward\n | title = The Making of ''Sky Captain'' - Part 3!\n | work = ComingSoon.net\n | date = September 14, 2004\n | url = http://www.comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=6284\n | access-date = December 20, 2012\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080605022651/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=6384\n | archive-date = June 5, 2008\n}}</ref>\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as Commander Francesca \"Franky\" Cook, commander of a Royal Navy flying aircraft carrier.

In 1922, skyscraper architect [[Harvey Wiley Corbett]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/library/01/0194/T019422.asp |title=Harvey Wiley Corbett |publisher=Artnet.com |access-date=2011-08-29}}</ref> commissioned [http://www.loggia.com/parti/frontage/ferriss.html Ferriss] to draw a series of four step-by-step perspectives demonstrating the architectural consequences of the [[1916 Zoning Resolution]]. These four drawings would later be used in his 1929 book ''[[The Metropolis of Tomorrow]]'' ([[Dover Publications]], 2005, {{ISBN|0-486-43727-2}}).\n\nRegarding the 1939 New York World's Fair itself and its futuristic theme of the World of Tomorrow, Conran noted: \"... obviously the title refers to the World Expo and the spirit of that was looking at the future with a sense of optimism and a sense of the whimsical, you know, something that we've lost a lot in our fantasies. We're more cynical, more practical, ... I think what this film attempts to do is to take that enthusiasm and innocence and celebrate it-to not get mired in the practicality that we're fixated upon today.\"<ref name=\"Claw, Walter\">{{cite news\n | last        = Claw\n | first       = Walter\n | title       = ''Sky'''s Not the Limit: Kerry Conran on being a pioneer of ''Tomorrow''\n | publisher   = FilmFreaks.net\n | date        = October 3, 2004\n | url         = http://filmfreakcentral.net/notes/kconraninterview.htm\n | access-date  = October 20, 2007\n | url-status     = dead\n | archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070806003221/http://filmfreakcentral.net/notes/kconraninterview.htm\n | archive-date = August 6, 2007\n | df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nConran acknowledged his debt to [[German Expressionism]], which was particularly evident in the opening scenes in New York City: \"Early German cinema was born of just a completely different aesthetic than what we see nowadays. One of the last things I watched before starting this project was the ''[[Dr. Mabuse]]'' series that [[Fritz Lang|Lang]] had done{{mdash}}terribly inspirational, the use of art and propaganda even.\"<ref name=\"Claw, Walter\"/>\n\nConran summarized his influences: \"We tried to approach it almost as though we lived in that era and were just another group of artists trying to make a work out of those pieces and inspirations. We wanted the film to feel like a lost film of that era. If we're a footnote in the history of [[Pulp magazine|pulp art]] and [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age comics]], that'd be enough, that'd be great. If we even just inspire some people to go back and investigate some of that stuff, we'd have done enough.\"<ref name=\"Claw, Walter\"/>\n\n''Sky Captain'' has a number of commonalities with [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s [[anime]] movie ''[[Castle in the Sky|Laputa: Castle in the Sky]]'' (1986). The sky pirates' focus on primitive mechanics, large airships, and military cultures is similar. Both stories center on an evil madman controlling an island of high technology, and the search for that island. ''Laputa'' has the evil madman searching for the island, but ''Sky Captain'' has the island as the madman's base from the beginning. ''Sky Captain''{{'}}s message is largely about the film genre, but ''Laputa'' has strong anti-war and anti-technology themes, found in most of Miyazaki's work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moria.co.nz/sf/skycaptain.htm |title=Moria : Sky Captain and the world of Tomorrow : Review |publisher=Moria.co.nz |access-date=2015-07-16}}</ref> Both pay homage to the 1941 ''[[Superman]]'' animated short ''[[The Mechanical Monsters]]''.\n\n===Teaser trailer===\nIn 1994, Conran began assembling moviemaking tools, including a [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] in his living room. He was not interested in working his way through the system and instead wanted to follow the route of independent filmmakers like [[Steven Soderbergh]]. Initially, Kerry and his brother had nothing more than \"just a vague idea of this guy who flew a plane.

Nine months before filming, Avnet had Conran meet the actors and begin rehearsals in an attempt to get the shy filmmaker out of his shell. Avnet set up a custom digital effects studio with a blue screen soundstage in an abandoned building in [[Van Nuys, California]]. A group of almost 100 digital artists, modelers, animators, and compositors created multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for the live action footage yet to be filmed.\n\nThe entire movie was sketched out via hand-drawn storyboards and then re-created as computer-generated 3D animatics with all of the 2D background photographs digitally painted to resemble the 1939 setting. With the animatics as a guide, grids were created to map camera and actor movements with digital characters standing in for the real actors. The grids were made into actual maps on the blue screen stage floor to help the actors move around invisible scenery.<ref name = \"Cellini, Joe\">{{cite news\n | last = Cellini\n | first = Joe\n | title = ''Sky Captain'' Flies to Big Screen\n | publisher = Apple Pro/Video\n | date = September 2004\n | url = https://www.apple.com/pro/video/conran/\n | access-date = April 2, 2007\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070202134643/http://www.apple.com/pro/video/conran/\n | archive-date = February 2, 2007\n}}</ref>\n\nTen months before Conran made the movie with his actors, he shot it entirely with stand-ins in [[Los Angeles]] and then created the whole movie in animatics so that the actors had an idea of what the film would look like and where to move on the soundstage. To prepare for the film, Conran had his cast watch old movies, such as [[Lauren Bacall]] in ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]'' (1944) for Paltrow's performance and ''[[The Thin Man (film)|The Thin Man]]'' (1934) for the relationship between Nick and Nora that was to be echoed in the one between Joe and Polly.<ref name=\"Axmaker, Sean\"/> Avnet constantly pushed for room in this meticulously designed movie for the kind of freedom the actors needed, like being able to move around on the soundstage.\n\n===Principal photography and post-production===\nConran and Avnet were able to cut costs considerably by shooting the entire movie in 26 days \u2014 far less than the three-to-four month schedules usually allotted to [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] films \u2014 on [[high-definition video]] using a [[Sony HDW-F900]] and working on three blue screens, mainly on Stage 2 (George Lucas Stage) at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] in [[London, England]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cinemat.blogg.org/cinematography-c26296736|title = Cinematography - cinemat}}</ref> with one notable exception. Conran wrote a scene that was added later in which Polly talks to her editor in his office that was shot on a physical set because there was no time to shoot it on a blue screen soundstage.<ref name=\"Axmaker, Sean\"/> The footage from the HD camera was run through a switcher and then through a Macintosh computer running [[Final Cut Pro]] that allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. Conran said, \"I don't know how we would have made this movie. It's really what allowed us to line up everything, given there was nothing there.\"<ref name=\"Cellini, Joe\"/> After each day of shooting, footage was edited and sent overnight to editors in Los Angeles who added CG and sent it back.\n\nAfter filming ended, they put together a 24-minute presentation and took it to every studio in June 2003. There was a lot of interest and Avnet selected the studio that gave Conran the most creative control. They needed studio backing to finish the film's ambitious visuals. At one point, the producer remembers that Conran was \"working 18 to 20 hours a day for a long period of time.

The distinctive look of the film was achieved by running footage through a diffusion filter and then tinting it in black and white before color was blended, balanced and added back in.\n\n[[Laurence Olivier]], who died in 1989, posthumously appears as the villain and [[mad scientist]] Dr. [[Totenkopf]]. His likeness was produced using digitally manipulated archival [[BBC]] footage of the actor and thus adding one more film to his repertoire. A similar technique was used two years later in ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006) with [[Marlon Brando]].\n\nAvnet cultivated a calculated release for the movie by first moving its release date from mid-2004, one week before ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', to September. He courted the Internet press and finally made an appearance at the [[San Diego Comic-Con]] with key cast members in an attempt to generate some advance buzz.<ref name=\"Douglas, Edward, part 2\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Edward Shearmur]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| caption    =\n| released   = September 7, 2004 (original), September 12, 2017 (expanded)\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Sony]] (original), La-La Land Records (expanded)\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [http://www.allmusic.com/album/sky-captain-and-the-world-of-tomorrow-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-mw0000394364 AllMusic]\n|rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}\n|rev2 = [https://archive.today/20130122034619/http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?SID=9895 Empire]\n|rev2score = {{rating|3|5}}\n|rev3 = [http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/sky_captain.html Filmtracks]\n|rev3score = {{rating|4|5}}\n|rev4 = [http://www.movie-wave.net/titles/sky_captain.html Movie Wave]\n|rev4score = {{rating|4|5}}\n|rev5 = [https://web.archive.org/web/20121016194801/http://www.scorenotes.com/reviewArchive/skycaptain.html ScoreNotes]\n|rev5Score = {{rating|8|10}}\n|rev6 = [http://www.soundtrack.net/albums/database/?id=3561 SoundtrackNet]\n|rev6score = {{rating|4.5|5}}\n}}\n\nThe composer [[Edward Shearmur]] wrote the film's orchestral score in the style of Hollywood's golden-age composers, and the film's end-title sequence featured a new recording of the song \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" sung by the American jazz singer [[Jane Monheit]], which were all featured on [[Sony Classical Records|Sony Classical's]] original motion picture soundtrack recording.<ref>{{cite news | title=''Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow'' Official Website | url=http://www.sonyclassical.com/music/92932/|publisher=Sonyclassical.com|access-date=2015-07-16}}</ref> La-La Land Records released a limited edition 2-disc set in 2017 with the complete score.<ref>{{cite web| title=Album page|url=http://www.lalalandrecords.com/Site/SkyCaptain.html|access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref>\n\n===Sony Classical track listing===\n# \"The World of Tomorrow\" \u2013 1:07\n# \"The Zeppelin Arrives\" \u2013 1:53\n# \"The Robot Army\" \u2013 3:01\n# \"Calling Sky Captain\" \u2013 3:26\n# \"Back at the Base\" \u2013 2:49\n# \"The Flying Wings Attack\" \u2013 6:31\n# \"An Aquatic Escape\" \u2013 2:29\n# \"Flight to Nepal\" \u2013 4:38\n# \"Treacherous Journey\" \u2013 2:22\n# \"Dynamite\" \u2013 2:26\n# \"Three in a Bed\" \u2013 0:57\n# \"Finding Frankie\" \u2013 5:02\n# \"Manta Squadron\" \u2013 6:33\n# \"h-770-d\" \u2013 1:14\n# \"Flying Lizard\" \u2013 1:06\n# \"Totenkopf's Ark\" \u2013 5:01\n# \"Back to Earth\" \u2013 3:14\n# \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" \u2013 3:54\n\n===La-La Land Records track listing===\n{{colbegin}}\nDisc 1 (unreleased tracks in bold, tracks with unreleased material in italics)\n# The World of Tomorrow 1:09\n#  The Zeppelin Arrives 1:53\n# '''Telegram''' 1:36\n# '''Meet Polly''' 1:33\n# '''The Office''' 2:16\n# The Robot Army 3:02\n# Calling Sky Captain 3:23\n# '''After Robots'''/'''Meet Dex''' 2:58\n# Back at the Base 2:53\n# '''Hanger-Car'''/'''Jennings Lab'''/'''Dr. Jennings Is Dead''' 6:05\n# The Flying Wings Attack/'''Wiggly Robots''' 8:13\n# ''An Aquatic Escape'' 2:32\n# '''S.C.
