It is the fourth installment of the live-action [[Transformers (film series)|''Transformers'' film series]] and the sequel to ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon|Dark of the Moon]]'' (2011), taking place five years after its events. Like its predecessors, it was directed by [[Michael Bay]] and written by [[Ehren Kruger]], with [[Steven Spielberg]] and Bay as executive producers. It stars [[Mark Wahlberg]], [[Stanley Tucci]], [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Nicola Peltz]], [[Jack Reynor]], [[Sophia Myles]], [[Bingbing Li]], [[Titus Welliver]], and [[T.J. Miller]]. It does not feature the original human cast from the previous three films, and instead introduces a new human cast and many new Transformers, including the Dinobots. Returning Transformers include [[Optimus Prime]], [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], Ratchet, Brains, and [[Megatron]] (now known as [[Galvatron]]). The screenplay was written by [[Ehren Kruger]]. ''Age of Extinction'' was the first feature film to be shot on [[IMAX#IMAX/Phantom 3D digital camera|smaller digital IMAX cameras]], as well as various other film formats, such as IMAX 70mm film cameras, digital stereo 3-D, and anamorphic and spherical 35mm film.\n\nThe film was released on June 27, 2014, in [[IMAX]] and [[3D film|3D]],<ref>{{cite web |date= March 12, 2014 |first= Germain |last= Lussier |title= 'Transformers 4' IMAX Poster: Giant Robots On the Giant Screen |publisher=[[/Film]] |url= https://www.slashfilm.com/transformers-4-imax-poster/ |access-date= March 20, 2014 }}</ref> and received negative reviews from critics for its runtime, performances, screenplay, and direction.<!-- [[WP:FILMLEDE]] All claims must be clearly supported by the Critical response section. --> The film was a box office success, grossing over $1.104 billion worldwide on a $210 million budget, making it the [[2014 in film#Highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of 2014]], the only film in 2014 to gross over $1 billion,  and at that point the [[List of highest-grossing films|<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT.

It was nominated for 7 awards at the [[35th Golden Raspberry Awards]], including [[Worst Picture]], winning [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Bay and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor|Worst Supporting Actor]] for Grammer. The sequel, ''[[Transformers: The Last Knight|The Last Knight]]'', was released in June 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nSixty-five million years ago, an alien race known as the \"Creators\" used devices called Seeds to cover [[Planet Earth|Earth]] with a metallic alloy called \"Transformium\", [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event|wiping out the dinosaurs in the process]]. In the present day, [[geologist]] Darcy Tirrel excavates the Transformium for K.S.I. Industries, that use it to build Transformers drones.\n\nFive years after the [[Transformers: Dark of the Moon|Battle of Chicago]],{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 2011 film ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]''.}} the humans view Transformers as hostile and terminate all joint operations with the aliens. Though the public believes that the [[Autobot]]s were granted sanctuary, they are hunted down by a rogue CIA black ops division, Cemetery Wind, led by opportunistic, rogue intelligence operative Harold Attinger, who has delusions that all Transformers are dangerous and must be destroyed. [[Lockdown (Transformers)|Lockdown]], a Cybertronian [[assassin]] and [[bounty hunter]] working for the Creators, is tasked to find [[Optimus Prime]] and kill any Autobots who refuse to give up his location. In exchange, he gives Attinger a Seed if his division manages to capture Optimus. Lockdown locates and kills Ratchet when he refuses to give up Optimus's location.\n\nOptimus, badly damaged in Mexico City, hides in [[Texas]] and is discovered by Cade Yeager, a financially struggling inventor. While his teenage daughter Tessa and business partner Lucas Flannery encourage him to turn Optimus over to the authorities, Cade instead fixes Optimus. Still skeptical of Optimus, Lucas alerts the authorities, and James Savoy, Attinger's field commanding operative, attacks the Yeager farm, but Optimus, and Tessa's secret boyfriend, Irish [[rally car]] driver Shane Dyson, rescues the family. During the pursuit, Lucas is killed by one of Lockdown's grenades. Optimus summons the surviving Autobots \u2013 [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Hound (Transformers)|Hound]], Drift, and [[Crosshairs (Transformers)|Crosshairs]]. Using a stolen CIA drone, Cade discovers K.S.I.'s involvement with Cemetery Wind and the attacks on the Autobots.\n\t\nInfiltrating K.S.I.'s headquarters in [[Chicago]], Cade discovers the dead Autobots and [[Decepticons]] being melted down to make Transformer drones. The K.S.I. CEO, Joshua Joyce, is in league with Attinger to revolutionize global defenses and improve human society using the Seed. He has also used the captured Brains and [[Megatron]]'s head to create prototype Transformer soldiers, [[Galvatron]] and Stinger. The Autobots storm the building and destroy the laboratory, but they soon leave after Joshua announces that they don't need them anymore. Attinger forces Joshua to deploy Galvatron to capture the Autobots. During the battle, Galvatron's behavior becomes slightly erratic. As Galvatron battles Optimus, it gets autonomously freed from control. Suddenly, Lockdown arrives and abducts both Optimus and Tessa while Galvatron retreats.\n\nWhile Lockdown's large prison spacecraft hovers over [[Chicago]] to hand over the Seed, Cade, Shane, and the Autobots sneak on board to rescue Optimus and Tessa. They hijack a smaller ship, containing other Transformers called the [[List of Transformers books|Dinobot]]s, just before Lockdown leaves Earth. The Autobots learn that Galvatron is Megatron reincarnated, plotting to use the Seed and the Transformer drones to conquer the world and that KSI plans to use the Seed in the Mongolian desert to create vast amounts of usable Transformium. Cade informs Joshua, who agrees to hand over the Seed with help from Darcy and his Chinese business associate Su Yueming. Galvatron reactivates himself and a battle follows in [[Hong Kong]] between the Autobots, Cemetery Wind, and the drones. During the fight, Cade sends Savoy plummeting to death while Optimus frees the Dinobots and wins their allegiance through [[trial by combat]], becoming essential to the Autobots' victory.\n\nLockdown returns to recapture Optimus and the Dinobots, using a large magnet to cause destruction. After disabling the magnet, Optimus fights Lockdown. In the ensuing duel, Optimus kills Attinger to save Cade, but the distraction allows Lockdown to pin Optimus down with his sword. Cade ends up fighting Lockdown one-on-one while Tessa and Shane use a tow truck to free Optimus, who kills Lockdown, avenging Ratchet\u2019s death, before defeating the remaining drones with Lockdown's grenades. Galvatron retreats, vowing to return. Optimus asks the Autobots to protect the Yeagers while Joshua offers to help them build a new home, before flying away into space with the Seed, sending a message to the Creators that he is coming for them. {{refn|name=Timeline2|group=N|As depicted in the 2017 film ''[[Transformers: The Last Knight]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Transformers film series cast and characters}}\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Cade Yeager: <br /> A single father and struggling inventor.<ref name=\"Wahlberg\">{{cite web |url=http://michaelbay.com/2012/11/08/michel-bay-re-teams-with-his-pain-gain-star-mark-mark-wahlberg-for-transformers-4/ |title=Michael Bay Re-Teams With His 'Pain & Gain' Star Mark Wahlberg for Transformers 4|publisher=Michael Bay.com|date=November 11, 2012 |access-date=February 3, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210024506/http://michaelbay.com/2012/11/08/michel-bay-re-teams-with-his-pain-gain-star-mark-mark-wahlberg-for-transformers-4/|archive-date=February 10, 2014 |url-status= dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Joshua Joyce: <br /> An ambitious, arrogant businessman and the head of KSI who wants to build his own Transformers.<ref>{{cite web |date=April 16, 2013 |author=SILAS LESNICK |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/cinemaconnews.php?id=103034 |title=CinemaCon: Stanley Tucci Joins Transformers 4 |publisher=Comingsoon.net |access-date=2020-07-13 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Meares |first=Tasha |url=http://fansided.com/2014/06/18/seven-new-images-transformers-age-extinction |title=Seven new images from Transformers: Age of Extinction |publisher=Fansided.com |date=2014-06-18 |access-date=2014-07-13}}</ref>\n* [[Kelsey Grammer]] as Harold Attinger: <br /> A rogue CIA operative and government official who created the CIA black-ops unit, Cemetery Wind to eliminate all Transformers, Autobot or Decepticon, from Earth.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/05/kelsey-grammer-lands-lead-human-villain-in-transformers-sequel/ |title=Kelsey Grammer Lands Lead (Human) Villain In 'Transformers' Sequel |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=2013-05-01 |access-date=2014-07-13}}</ref>\n* [[Nicola Peltz]] as Tessa Yeager: <br /> Cade's daughter who is secretly dating Shane.\n* [[Jack Reynor]] as Shane Dyson: <br /> Tessa's boyfriend and an Irish rally car driver.<ref name=\"THRHotYoung2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/michael-bay-testing-hot-young-390516 |title=Michael Bay Testing Hot Young Actors for 'Transformers 4' Leads (Exclusive) |last=Kit |first=Borys |date=November 14, 2012 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date=June 25, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=\"Reynor2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jack-reynor-lands-starring-role-409850 |title=Jack Reynor Lands Starring Role |last=Kit |first=Borys |date=January 8, 2013 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=February 3, 2014 }}</ref>\n* [[Sophia Myles]] as Darcy Tyril: <br /> Joshua's geologist assistant and ex-girlfriend.<ref name=\"thewrap.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/sophia-myles-join-mark-wahlberg-michael-bays-transformers-4-exclusive-89661 |title=Sophia Myles to Join Mark Wahlberg in Michael Bay's 'Transformers 4' (Exclusive) |publisher=TheWrap.com |date=2013-05-06 |access-date=2014-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/stanley-tucci-sophia-myles-transformers-age-of-extinction/ |title=Transformers: Age of Extinction Interview with Stanley Tucci |publisher=Collider.com |date=2013-11-20 |access-date=2014-07-13}}</ref><!-- This interview is the only one that uses different last name for Tucci's character.
