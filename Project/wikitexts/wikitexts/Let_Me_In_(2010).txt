It is a [[remake]] of the 2008 Swedish film ''[[Let the Right One In (film)|Let the Right One In]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=66529 |title=American Film Institute: Let Me In}}</ref> The film tells the story of a [[School bullying|bullied]] 12-year-old boy who befriends and develops a romantic relationship with a female child [[vampire]] in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]], during the early 1980s.\n\nInterest in producing an English-language version of ''Let the Right One In'' began in 2007 shortly before it was released to audiences. In 2008, [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]] acquired the rights for the English adaptation and initially offered [[Tomas Alfredson]], the director of the Swedish film, the opportunity to direct, which he declined. Reeves was then signed to direct and write the screenplay. Reeves made several changes for the English version such as altering the setting from [[Stockholm]] to New Mexico and renaming the lead characters. The film's producers stated that their intent was to keep the plot similar to the original, yet make it more accessible to a wider audience. Principal photography began in early November 2009, and concluded in January 2010. The film's budget was estimated to be $20{{nbsp}}million.\n\n''Let Me In'' premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 13, 2010, and was released in North America on October 1, 2010. The film was placed on several critics' top ten list. Many critics noted it as a rare Hollywood remake which stayed true to the original, while others criticized it for being too derivative of the Swedish film. The film earned $24{{nbsp}}million in box office revenue worldwide, of which $12{{nbsp}}million was earned in the United States and Canada. Moretz won several awards for her performance with critics praising the on-screen chemistry with her co-star, Smit-McPhee. ''Let Me In'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] in North America on February 1, 2011, and in the UK on March 14, 2011. An official [[comic book]] [[miniseries]] [[prequel]] titled ''[[Let Me In: Crossroads]]'' was released after the film which establishes the back-story of Abby and ends where the theatrical film begins.\n\n==Plot==\nIn March 1983, in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]], a disfigured man is taken to the hospital. An unnamed police detective tries to question him about a recent murder. While the detective answers a call outside the room, the disfigured man jumps out of the window, leaving behind a note that reads: \"I'M SORRY ABBY\".\n\nTwo weeks earlier, Owen, an unhappy and lonely 12-year-old boy who is neglected by his [[Divorce|divorcing]] parents, sees a barefoot little girl named Abby and an older man moving in next door. At school, a teenage bully named Kenny and two of his friends constantly terrorize Owen, who lies to his mother about it but tells Abby the truth. Abby encourages him to retaliate, and pledges to protect him. Owen and Abby become close friends and start communicating by [[Morse code]] through the walls of their apartments. Abby's companion Thomas abducts a local teenager and drains the boy's blood into a jug, only to accidentally spill all of its contents. Starving, Abby attacks a neighbor and [[Vampire|drinks his blood]], killing him and forcing Thomas to dispose of the body.\n\nOn a later night, Thomas hides in the back of another car, but is discovered. In the ensuing struggle, the car falls into a ditch and flips over. Trapped, Thomas pours [[Concentration|concentrated]] [[sulfuric acid]] on his face, rendering himself unrecognizable and hospitalizing himself. Abby learns what happened and visits Thomas in the hospital, who lets her drink his blood before falling to his death. That night, Owen is awakened by Abby, who insists he verbally invite her in. She spends the night in his bed and agrees to be his girlfriend. The next day, Owen's class goes ice skating on a river. Cornered by the bullies, Owen smashes the side of Kenny\u2019s head with a metal pole, splitting his left ear. At the same moment, the students discover the neighbor's body encased in the ice.\n\nLater, Owen tries to make a [[Blood brother|blood pact]] with Abby. Seeing blood, Abby reveals her vampire form and flees, feeding on another neighbor. The next night, Abby admits to Owen that she is a vampire and that Thomas was not her father. Owen discovers an aged photo of her with Thomas as a young boy. Scared, Owen wants to leave, but he is stopped by Abby who will not answer his demands on letting him out. Owen finally leaves after asking Abby what she will do to him.\n\nOwen sneaks out to spend the night at Abby's apartment. In the morning, the detective forces his way into Abby's apartment and finds her asleep, only to be distracted by Owen. Abby wakes and attacks the detective, killing him. Horrified at her actions, Abby decides to leave town and kisses a heartbroken Owen goodbye. During swim class, Kenny, Jimmy, and their friends ambush Owen and begin to drown him, only to be [[Dismemberment|dismembered]] by Abby, who returned to rescue Owen.\n\nThe next day, Owen leaves town on a train, concealing Abby in a large trunk.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Let the Right One In characters}}\n{{cast list|\n* [[Kodi Smit-McPhee]] as Owen, a 12-year-old bullied schoolboy, later Abby's boyfriend\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] as Abby, a vampire who poses as Thomas' daughter, later Owen's girlfriend\n* [[Elias Koteas]] as a detective investigating the murders caused by Abby\n** Koteas also provides the voice of Owen's father\n* [[Cara Buono]] as Owen's mother\n* [[Sasha Barrese]] as Virginia, one of Abby's victims\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Thomas, Abby's adult companion\n* [[Dylan Minnette]] as Kenny, a bully who torments Owen\n* [[Ritchie Coster]] as Mr. Zori\u0107\n* [[Jimmy Pinchak|Jimmy Jax Pinchak]] as Mark, one of Kenny's friends\n* Nicolai Dorian as Donald, one of Kenny's friends\n* Colin Moretz as Cashier\n* Dylan Kenin as Larry, Virginia's boyfriend\n* Brett DelBuono as Jimmy, the older brother of Kenny\n* [[Chris Browning]] as Jack, one of Abby's victims\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nAccording to [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]] executive producer [[Nigel Sinclair]], interest in the project initially began in the middle of 2007, before the original ''[[Let the Right One In (film)|Let the Right One In]]'' had screened for audiences.<ref>{{cite video |title=Let Me In: Nigel Sinclair Interview |url=http://www.movieweb.com/movie/let-me-in/nigel-sinclair-interview |publisher=MovieWeb.com |access-date=March 31, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413170435/http://www.movieweb.com/movie/let-me-in/nigel-sinclair-interview |archive-date=April 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe rights for the English-language film were later acquired by Hammer Films at the 2008 [[Tribeca Film Festival]], where ''Let the Right One In'' won the \"Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature,\" and [[Matt Reeves]] was quickly introduced as the director.<ref name=\"variety_remake\">{{cite web |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117992833.html |title=Matt Reeves bites into ''Right One'' |last1=Fleming |first1=Michael |first2=Dave |last2=McNary |date=September 24, 2008 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=May 19, 2009}}</ref> John Nordling and Carl Molinder, the Swedish producers of the original film, were both involved as producers for the adaptation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17930 |title=''Let Me In'' Officially Begins Production in New Mexico |last=Misak |first=Brad |date=November 2, 2009 |work=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |access-date=April 6, 2010}}</ref> [[Tomas Alfredson]], the director of the Swedish film, was initially asked to direct the remake, but he turned it down stating that \"I am too old to make the same film twice and I have other stories that I want to tell.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://totalscifionline.com/interviews/3356-tomas-alfredson-new-wave-vampires |title=Tomas Alfredson: New Wave Vampires |work=Total Sci-Fi Online |date=April 9, 2009 |access-date=March 31, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201235025/http://totalscifionline.com/interviews/3356-tomas-alfredson-new-wave-vampires |archive-date=December 1, 2010}}</ref> Hammer Films producer [[Simon Oakes (executive)|Simon Oakes]] initially referred to the film with \"If you call it a faithful remake, I think that's true to say that's what it is.

He used [[Ronald Reagan]]'s \"[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire speech]]\" as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, \"The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the [[Soviets]]\". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he \"would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [Reagan era] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day?

Composing the score to convey the correct emotion was also a challenge for Giacchino who said, \"... it was tricky finding the right balance of, well, should this be scary?

He said:\n\n{{blockquote|I might just be the luckiest writer alive. To have not only one, but two excellent versions of my debut novel done for the screen feels unreal. ''Let the Right One In'' is a great Swedish movie. ''Let Me In'' is a great American movie. There are notable similarities and the spirit of Tomas Alfredson is present. But ''Let Me In'' puts the emotional pressure in different places and stands firmly on its own legs. Like the Swedish movie it made me cry, but not at the same points. ''Let Me In'' is a dark and violent love story, a beautiful piece of cinema and a respectful rendering of my novel for which I am grateful.
