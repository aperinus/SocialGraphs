Pictures]], based on [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|the 2000 novel of the same name]]. Produced by [[David Heyman]] and written by [[Steve Kloves]], it is the sequel to ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' (2004) and the fourth instal<!-- British English uses only one \"l\" -->ment in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]]. The film stars [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], alongside [[Rupert Grint]] and [[Emma Watson]] as Harry's best friends [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] respectively. Its story follows Harry's fourth year at [[Hogwarts]] as he is chosen by the [[Goblet of Fire]] to compete in the Triwizard Tournament.\n\nPrincipal photography began in early 2004, and the film premiered worldwide on 18 November 2005. Five days following release, it had earned over US$102 million at the North American box office, the third-highest first-weekend tally for a ''Harry Potter'' film behind ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2|Part 2]]''. ''Goblet of Fire'' enjoyed an immensely successful run at the box office, grossing $896 million worldwide, the [[2005 in film#Highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of 2005]] and the sixth-highest-grossing film in the series.\n\nThe film was nominated for the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Production Design]]. ''Goblet of Fire'' was the second film in the series to be released in [[IMAX]]. The film is one of the best-reviewed instal<!-- British English uses only one \"l\" -->ments within the series, being praised for the higher level of maturity and sophistication of its characters, story, tone, screenplay, and the performances of the lead actors. It was followed by ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' in 2007.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] has a nightmare in which a [[Muggle]] caretaker is murdered after overhearing a plot by [[Lord Voldemort]], [[Peter Pettigrew (character)|Peter Pettigrew]] and another man whom Harry does not recognise. Harry, along with the [[Weasleys]], [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] and [[Amos Diggory]] attend the [[Quidditch]] World Cup. [[Death Eaters]] attack the tournament and the man from Harry's nightmare casts the [[Dark Mark]].\n\nAt [[Hogwarts]], [[Professor Dumbledore]] announces that the school will host the Triwizard Tournament along with the [[Durmstrang Institute]] from northern Europe and the [[Beauxbatons Academy]] from France. A single student from each school will be selected by the [[Goblet of Fire]] to participate; students below the age of seventeen are ineligible. [[Fleur Delacour]] is selected as the Champion from Beauxbatons, [[Viktor Krum]] is selected from Durmstrang, and [[Cedric Diggory]] is selected from Hogwarts. The Goblet of Fire then selects Harry as the fourth Champion, causing much confusion. Many students believe Harry cheated and Ron shuns him, hurt that Harry did not inform him when he apparently entered.\n\nFor the first task, the Champions have to collect an egg by getting past a dragon. [[Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]], the new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher, hints that Harry can use his wand to summon his broomstick. All four Champions collect their eggs. Ron reconciles with Harry after seeing how dangerous the first task was. At Christmas, the school hosts the Yule Ball \u2013 Harry and Ron are unable to go with their desired dates, and hence go with Parvati and Padma Patil respectively; while Hermione goes with Viktor. Cedric advises Harry to use the Prefects' bathroom to get a clue for the second task using the egg.\n\nFor the second task, the Champions have to save somebody of value to them from the Black Lake: Harry has to save Ron, Cedric has to save Cho, Viktor has to rescue Hermione, and Fleur has to save her sister. [[Neville Longbottom]] gives Harry [[gillyweed]] to help him breathe underwater. Cedric comes in first and Harry is awarded second place after he saves not only Ron but Fleur's sister after Fleur withdraws from the task. Harry later finds the lifeless body of [[Barty Crouch Sr]], a [[Ministry of Magic]] official, in the [[Forbidden Forest (Harry Potter)|Forbidden Forest]]. In Dumbledore's office, he enters a [[Pensieve]] and witnesses a previous trial of [[Igor Karkaroff]], current headmaster of Durmstrang, during Voldemort's first downfall. Karkaroff is asked to name those who served Voldemort \u2013 he gives [[Severus Snape]] who is vouched for by Dumbledore. Karkaroff then exposes [[Barty Crouch Jr]], the son of Crouch Sr who is hosting the trial. Harry recognises Crouch Jr from his nightmare.\n\nFor the third task, the Champions must navigate a maze to reach the Triwizard Cup at its centre. Harry and Cedric reach the Cup only to discover it is a [[Portkey]] that transports them to a graveyard. [[Peter Pettigrew (character)|Peter Pettigrew]] kills Cedric on Voldemort's orders. He then resurrects Voldemort, who summons his Death Eaters. Voldemort attempts to use the [[Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]] on Harry but the latter deflects it \u2013 the ghosts of Voldemort's previous victims appear, distracting Voldemort long enough for Harry to use the Cup to return to Hogwarts with Cedric's body.\n\nHarry informs Dumbledore that Cedric was murdered by Voldemort. Harry is dragged by Moody to his office \u2013 he learns that Moody entered him into the Tournament and was guiding him to ensure the return of Voldemort. Before Moody attempts to kill Harry, Dumbledore, Snape and [[Minerva McGonagall]] subdue Moody. Using [[Veritaserum]], they learn that they have caught Barty Crouch Jr who was impersonating Moody using [[Polyjuice Potion]]; the real Moody is imprisoned in a magical trunk. Crouch Jr is returned to [[Azkaban]].\n\nAt the end of term feast, Dumbledore announces that Cedric was murdered by Voldemort, although the Ministry denies these claims. Harry informs Dumbledore of his encounter with Voldemort and Dumbledore describes it as [[Priori Incantatem]]. The three schools bid farewell to one another with Harry, Ron and Hermione agreeing that everything is going to change.\n\n==Cast==\n{{further|List of Harry Potter cast members}}\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]: A 14-year-old British [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] famous for surviving his parents' murder at the hands of the evil dark wizard [[Lord Voldemort]] as an infant, who now enters his fourth year at [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name=\"MainCastBBC\" />\n* [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Ron Weasley]]: Harry's best friend at Hogwarts and a younger member of the Weasley wizarding family.<ref name=\"MainCastBBC\" />\n* [[Emma Watson]] as [[Hermione Granger]]: Harry's other best friend and the trio's brains.<ref name=\"MainCastBBC\" />\n* [[Robbie Coltrane]] as [[Rubeus Hagrid]]: The [[gamekeeper]] and [[Care of Magical Creatures]] teacher at Hogwarts.<ref name=\"ColtraneIGN\" />\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Lord Voldemort]]:<br />A dark wizard intent on conquering the Wizarding World and the leader of the [[Death Eaters]].<ref name=\"FiennesGuardian\" /> Fiennes commented on the difficulty of playing someone who is \"the essence of evil,\" and discussed giving a humanity to Voldemort in order for him to be \"deeply, truly evil\", citing the character's unhappy childhood as fuel for \"anger, jealousy and hatred\".<ref name=\"FiennesIGN\" /> He and director [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]] were interested in exploring the character's \"unexpected mood swings\".<ref name=\"WestmorlandGazette\" /> Newell cited Fiennes' ability to play \"a realistic and frightening villain\" instead of \"a simple caricature\" as a reason for his casting.<ref name=\"NewellHpana\" />\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as [[Albus Dumbledore]]:<br />The [[headmaster]] of Hogwarts and one of the greatest wizards of all time.<ref name=\"GambonHerald\" /> Gambon commented on the state of the character in the film: \"Dumbledore is no longer in control and he's frightened.\"<ref name=\"WestmorlandGazette\" /> Newell compared Gambon's performance with [[Richard Harris]]' iteration in earlier films, showing the character as \"fallible and not omnipotent\" and \"inadequate rather than super-adequate.\"<ref name=\"NewellIGN\" />\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as [[Alastor Moody|Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody]]:<br />A famous ex-[[Auror]] appointed by Dumbledore as the new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher at Hogwarts.<ref name=\"CastEW\" /> [[Ray Winstone]] was originally offered the role but turned it down.<ref>{{Cite web |last=MacTaggart |first=Catriona |date=18 November 2021 |title=Stars Who Were Almost Cast In Harry Potter |url=https://www.nickiswift.com/665053/stars-who-were-almost-cast-in-harry-potter/ |url-status=live |access-date=9 January 2022 |website=nickiswift.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Cox |first=Brian |date=2022-01-14 |title=Why Brian Cox Wasn't in 'Game of Thrones,' 'Pirates of the Caribbean,' and 'Harry f-cking Potter' |url=https://www.gq.com/story/brian-cox-memoir-excerpt/ |access-date=2022-02-27 |publisher=GQ}}</ref> Gleeson referred to Moody as \"a gunslinger with a wand,\" whose \"great wounds have damaged him greatly.\" Heyman found Gleeson brought \"a great balance of ferociousness and humour\" to what he called a \"complex, challenging character.\"<ref name=\"GleesonIGN\" /> \n* [[Jason Isaacs]] as [[Lucius Malfoy]]: [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]]'s father and a former Hogwarts pupil of [[Slytherin]] House.

Mike's rich and diverse body of work show him to be the perfect choice. He has worked with children, made us laugh, and had us sitting on the edge of our seats. He is great with actors and imbues all his characters, all his films, with great humanity. I'm thrilled.<ref name=\"NewellEW\" />}}\n\nWork on the script began in April 2003.<ref name=\"HeymanBBC\" /> Heyman considered the pre-production on ''Goblet of Fire'' had been too lengthy for a single film. He stated, \"We're going to shoot it as one and see how it ends up. If it's too long then we'll make it into two.\"<ref name=\"HeymanBBC\" /> Kloves, writer for the previous instalments, returned for ''Goblet of Fire''. On adapting the 636-page book into a single feature-length film, Kloves commented, \"we always thought it would be two movies, but we could never figure out a way to break it in two. So it will be a different experience from the book.\"<ref name=\"KlovesChicagoTribune\" /> Columbus advised Heyman of splitting ''Goblet of Fire'' into two separate films due to its length, but [[Warner Bros.]] showed no interest in the idea.<ref name=\"ColumbusTHR\" /> Newell found that \"there was a way of making one film, which was as a thriller,\" while \"[staying] true to the book and [keeping] the length down.\"<ref name=\"NewellBBC\" /> In order to prepare for the film, Newell watched \"[[paranoid thriller]]s\" such as ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), ''[[The Parallax View]]'' (1974), and ''[[Three Days of the Condor]]'' (1975).<ref name=\"NewellTelegraph\" />\n\n===Costume and set design===\n{{multiple image\n | perrow   = 2\n | total_width = 300\n | align    = left\n | image1   = Beauxbatons dress, The Making of Harry Potter.jpg\n | alt1     = Beauxbatons dress\n | caption1 = [[Beauxbatons]] dress\n | image2   = HarryPotterExhibition CiteDuCinema ParisSaintDenis (18, cropped).jpg\n | alt2     = Hermione and Viktor Krum's costumes for the Yule Ball\n | caption2 = [[Yule Ball]] costumes for Viktor Krum and Hermione\n}}\nCostume designer [[Jany Temime]] returned as [[costume designer]] for ''Goblet of Fire''.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />{{rp|39}} Temime made the Beauxbatons uniforms out of [[Bleu de France (colour)|french blue]] silk,<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />{{rp|13}} which stood out from the muted colours of the other schools.<ref name=\"StudioTourCostumes\" /> The fabric of the uniforms \"clings to their form, in complete contrast to the restrictive uniforms the Hogwarts girls wear.\"<ref name=\"TemimeHuffPost\" /> The hat was designed by [[milliner]] [[Philip Treacy]].<ref name=\"StudioTourCostumes\" /> The Durmstrang uniform was made of thick wool,<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />{{rp|13}} with crimson robes and fur hats and capes.<ref name=\"TemimeBI\" /> Temime drew inspiration from [[Habsburg]] and [[Russian folklore]].<ref name=\"TemimeBI\" /> For the [[Yule Ball]], Temime created more than 300 costumes.<ref name=\"StudioTourCostumes\" /> Hermione's dress, which took three months to make,<ref name=\"StudioTourCostumes\" /> was designed to be a \"fairy-tale dress\",<ref name=\"TemimeManilaTimes\" /> balancing \"sweetness and allure\" and keeping it \"very prudish\",<ref name=\"TemimeLATimes\" /> in order for it to be \"slightly sexy\" while still appropriate for a teenager.<ref name=\"TemimeBI\" /><ref name=\"TemimeLATimes\" /> Moody's coat was inspired by [[spaghetti westerns]], with a team spending a week \"aging and distressing the coat to give it a lifetime's worth of wear.\"<ref name=\"GleesonIGN\" />\n\nAs in the previous instalments, [[Stuart Craig]] and [[Stephenie McMillan]] served as [[production designer]] and [[set decorator]], respectively. Due to the film's scope, there were many new sets and transformations of old sets created.
