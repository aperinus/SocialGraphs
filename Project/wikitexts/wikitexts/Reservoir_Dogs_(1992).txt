It stars [[Harvey Keitel]], [[Tim Roth]], [[Chris Penn]], [[Steve Buscemi]], [[Lawrence Tierney]], [[Michael Madsen]], Tarantino, and [[Edward Bunker]] as diamond thieves whose heist of a jewelry store goes terribly wrong. [[Kirk Baltz]], [[Randy Brooks (actor)|Randy Brooks]], and [[Steven Wright]] also play supporting roles. It incorporates many motifs that have become Tarantino's hallmarks: violent crime, pop culture references, profanity, and [[nonlinear storytelling]].\n\nThe film is regarded as a classic of [[independent film]] and a [[cult film]]<ref>{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Tobias |title=The New Cult Canon \u2013 Reservoir Dogs |url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/reservoir-dogs,16744/ |work=[[The A.V.

Although controversial at first for its depictions of violence and heavy use of profanity, ''Reservoir Dogs'' was generally well received, with the cast being praised by many critics. Despite not being heavily promoted during its theatrical run, the film became a modest success in the United States after grossing $2.8 million against its scant budget. It achieved higher popularity after the success of Tarantino's next film, ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994). A soundtrack was released featuring songs used in the film, which are mostly from the 1970s.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nEight gangsters eat breakfast at a Los Angeles diner. All but the boss Joe Cabot and his son, the [[underboss]] \"Nice Guy\" Eddie Cabot, use aliases: Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange and Mr. Pink. After Mr. Brown finishes rambling about the Madonna song \"[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]\", the group argues about Pink's policy of not tipping.\n\nThe gangsters carry out a diamond heist. White flees with Orange, who was shot during the escape and is bleeding severely in the back of White's car. At one of Joe's warehouses, White and Orange rendezvous with Pink, who believes that the job was a [[Sting operation|setup]], and that the police were waiting for them. White informs him that Brown is dead, Blue and Blonde are missing, and Blonde murdered several civilians during the heist. White is furious that Joe, his old friend, would employ Blonde, whom he describes as a psychopath. Pink has hidden the diamonds nearby. He argues with White over whether to get medical attention for Orange, and the pair draw guns at each other. They stand down when Blonde arrives with a kidnapped policeman, Marvin Nash.\n\nSome time earlier, Blonde meets with the Cabots, having completed a four-year jail sentence. To reward him for not having given Joe's name to the authorities for a lighter sentence, they offer him a [[no-show job]]. Blonde insists that he wants to get back to \"real work\", and they recruit him for the heist.\n\nIn the present, White and Pink beat Nash for information. Eddie arrives and orders them to retrieve the diamonds and ditch the getaway vehicles, leaving Blonde in charge of Nash and Orange. Nash denies knowledge, but Blonde ignores him and resumes the torture, cutting off Nash's ear with a straight razor. He prepares to set him on fire, but Orange shoots him dead. Orange reveals to Nash that he is an [[Undercover operation|undercover police officer]], and that the police will arrive soon.\n\nWhen Eddie, Pink, and White return, Orange tries to convince them that Blonde planned to kill them all and steal the diamonds for himself. Eddie impulsively kills Nash and accuses Orange of lying, since Blonde was loyal to his father. Joe arrives with news that the police have killed Blue. He is about to execute Orange, whom he suspects is the traitor behind the setup, but White intervenes and holds Joe at gunpoint, insisting that Orange is not an undercover cop. Eddie aims at White, creating a [[Mexican standoff]]. All three fire; both Cabots are killed, and White and Orange are hit.\n\nPink (the only uninjured person), takes the diamonds and flees, but is apprehended by the police outside. As White cradles the dying Orange in his arms, Orange confesses that he is an undercover officer. White presses his gun to Orange's head. The police storm the warehouse and order White to drop his gun. Gunshots sound and White collapses.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Reservoirdog.jpg|thumb|right|The film's opening credits sequence, a slow-motion scene featuring the eight criminals, accompanied by \"[[Little Green Bag]]\" by the [[George Baker Selection]]]]\n\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as Mr. White/Larry Dimmick\n* [[Tim Roth]] as Mr. Orange/Freddy Newandyke\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Mr. Blonde/\"Toothpick\" Vic Vega.

The radio station played a prominent role in the film.<ref>{{cite news | last = Strauss | first = Neil | title = The Pop Life Tarantino's music | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E2DD1E3AF93AA1575AC0A962958260 | newspaper = The New York Times | date = September 29, 1994 | access-date = May 5, 2008 | archive-date = December 7, 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081207213029/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E2DD1E3AF93AA1575AC0A962958260 | url-status = live }}</ref> The DJ for the radio was chosen to be [[Steven Wright]], a comedian known for his deadpan delivery of jokes.<ref name=\"Wright\">{{cite news | last = Howe | first = Desson | title = Reservoir Dogs | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/reservoirdogsrhowe_a0af27.htm | newspaper = The Washington Post | date = October 23, 1992 | access-date = May 2, 2013 | archive-date = November 8, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121108073933/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/reservoirdogsrhowe_a0af27.htm | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nAn unusual feature of the soundtrack was the choice of songs; Tarantino has said that he feels the music to be a counterpoint to the on-screen violence and action.<ref name=\"Breen\">{{cite web | last = Breen | first = Marcus | title = Woof, Woof: The real bite in Reservoir Dogs | publisher = Australian Humanities Review |date=December 1996 | url = http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au/AHR/archive/Issue-Dec-1996/breen.html | access-date = March 10, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080303144739/http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au/AHR/archive/Issue-Dec-1996/breen.html |archive-date = March 3, 2008}}</ref> He also stated that he wished for the film to have a 1950s feel while using '70s music.<ref name=\"Breen\" /> A prominent instance of this is the torture scene to the tune of \"[[Stuck in the Middle with You]]\".<ref>{{cite web | last = Jardine | first = Dan | title = The Killing Fields (on Reservoir Dogs) | url = http://www.thefilmjournal.com/issue10/reservoirdogs.html | publisher = The Film Journal | access-date = March 10, 2008 | archive-date = December 14, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071214055601/http://www.thefilmjournal.com/issue10/reservoirdogs.html | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n<!-- See [[Template:Tracklist]] to improve this section -->\n;Track listing\n# \"And Now Little Green Bag...\"{{snd}} dialogue extract performed by Steven Wright (0:15)\n# \"[[Little Green Bag]]\"{{snd}} [[George Baker Selection|The George Baker Selection]] (3:15)\n# \"Rock Flock of Five\"{{snd}} dialogue extract performed by Steven Wright (0:11)\n# \"[[Hooked on a Feeling]]\"{{snd}} [[Blue Swede]] (2:53)\n# \"Bohemiath\"{{snd}} dialogue extract performed by Steven Wright (0:34)\n# \"[[I Gotcha (Joe Tex song)|I Gotcha]]\"{{snd}} [[Joe Tex]] (2:27)\n# \"[[Magic Carpet Ride (Steppenwolf song)|Magic Carpet Ride]]\"{{snd}} Bedlam (5:10)\n# \"Madonna Speech\"{{snd}} dialogue extract performed by [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[Edward Bunker]], [[Lawrence Tierney]], [[Steve Buscemi]], and [[Harvey Keitel]] (0:59)\n# \"Fool for Love\" by Sandy Rogers (3:25)\n# \"Super Sounds\"{{snd}} dialogue extract performed by Steven Wright (0:19)\n# \"[[Stuck in the Middle with You]]\"{{snd}} [[Stealers Wheel]] (3:23)\n# \"Harvest Moon\"{{snd}} Bedlam (2:38)\n# \"Let's Get a Taco\"{{snd}} dialogue extract performed by [[Harvey Keitel]] and [[Tim Roth]] (1:02)\n# \"Keep on Truckin{{' \"}}{{snd}} dialogue extract performed by Steven Wright (0:16)\n# \"[[Coconut (song)|Coconut]]\"{{snd}} [[Harry Nilsson]] (3:50)\n# \"Home of Rock\"{{snd}} dialogue extract performed by Steven Wright (0:05)\n\n===Certifications===\n{{Certification Table Top}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|region=Australia|type=album|artist=Soundtrack|title=Reservoir dogs|award=Platinum|relyear=1992|certyear=1997|access-date=30 May 2019}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|region=Canada|type=album|artist=Various Artists|title=Reservoir dogs|award=Gold|relyear=1992|certyear=1994}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|region=New Zealand|type=album|artist=Soundtrack|title=Reservoir dogs|award=Platinum|relyear=1992|id=3731|access-date=30 May 2019}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|region=Spain|type=album|title=Resrvoir Dogs (B.S.O.
