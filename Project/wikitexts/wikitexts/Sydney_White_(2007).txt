The film, starring [[Amanda Bynes]], [[Sara Paxton]] and [[Matt Long]], was released theatrically on September 21, 2007 by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nTeenager Sydney White sets off to attend college at SAU and pledge to her mother's [[sorority]]. She become friends with Demetria Rosemead \"Dinky\" Hotchkiss, also an incoming member of the Kappa Sorority. While on their way to their dorm, she meets Tyler Prince, the president of a popular [[fraternity]] and the on-off boyfriend of the student council president and Kappa Sorority head, Rachel Witchburn. Rachel checks out her university's website that ranks the \"hottest\" in the school several times a day, and is always number one on the list. Tyler meets Sydney and is immediately smitten, while Rachel watches from her window. Sydney's unique and tomboyish personality gradually propels her popularity on the university website, making Rachel jealous.\n\nAs one of the Kappa Sorority's traditional initiation rituals, the freshmen need to find a date late at midnight. Sydney finds Lenny, one of a group of social outcasts called the \u201cseven dorks\u201d, who live in a run-down house known as the Vortex. Rachel instructs Sydney to ditch her date, leaving Lenny to pay. Rachel blocks Sydney's induction into Kappa by falsely claiming Sydney has lied about her background and cheated on a Kappa quiz. Sydney leaves that night in the rain and goes to sit in front of the Vortex, where she is welcomed by the seven dorks.\n\nSydney and the seven dorks try to bring Rachel down from her student council position by running one of the dorks, Terrence, for student body president. He is soon disqualified and Sydney replaces him as a presidential candidate. Sydney's stance against elitism on campus earns her respect from different cliques and she gets the number one rank on the school's \"hottest\" website.\n\nThe day before the debate and election, Rachel hires a hacker to destroy Sydney's files using a virus called 'The Poison Apple.' Sydney is then forced to stay up all night in the library doing her work. When Sydney finishes, she falls asleep and is almost disqualified for not showing up, but Tyler wakes her with a kiss just in time. Sydney wins the debate and the election, becoming the new president, while Rachel is stripped of her Kappa sisterhood privileges by her sisters because of the years of cruelty she bestowed on both her Kappa sisters and the students at the University as well as lying and cheating during the election.\n\nThe film ends with Sydney's father and other construction workers fixing the Vortex. And, according to Sydney's narration, they all lived \"dorkily ever after\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Amanda Bynes]] as Sydney White (Snow White)\n** Cree Ivey as young Sydney \n* [[Sara Paxton]] as Rachel Witchburn (Evil Queen)\n* [[Matt Long]] as Tyler Prince (Prince Charming)\n* [[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]] as Paul White\n* [[Crystal Hunt]] as Demetria Rosemead \"Dinky\" Hotchkiss (Rose Red)\n* Jack Carpenter as Lenny (Sneezy)\n* [[Jeremy Howard (actor)|Jeremy Howard]] as Terrence (Doc)\n* [[Adam Hendershott]] as Jeremy (Bashful)\n* [[Danny Strong]] as Gurkin (Grumpy)\n* [[Samm Levine]] as Spanky (Happy)\n* [[Arnie Pantoja]] as George (Dopey)\n* Dont\u00e9 Bonner as Embele (Sleepy)\n* [[Brian Patrick Clarke]] as Professor Carleton\n* Libby Mintz as Christy\n* Lisandra Vazquez as Amy\n* Lauren Leech as Katy\n* Kierstin Koppel as Goth girl\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] took place in and around Orlando from February 14, 2007 to April 4, 2007.
