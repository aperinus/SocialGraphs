All this is threatened when Mrs Cheveley appears in London with damning evidence of a past misdeed. Sir Robert turns to his friend Lord Goring for help, an apparently idle philanderer and the despair of his father. Goring knows the lady of old and the plot to help his friend has [[unintended consequence]]s.\n\nThe plot of the film differs from the original Wilde play in a number of key respects. The episode of Mrs Cheveley's lost bracelet was removed, and the twists at the end are made more complex by the introduction of a bet between Lord Goring and Mrs Cheveley, and Lord Goring's need to ask the permission of Sir Robert Chiltern to marry his sister, Miss Mabel Chiltern.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Cate Blanchett]] as Lady Gertrude Chiltern\n*[[Minnie Driver]] as Miss Mabel Chiltern\n*[[Rupert Everett]] as Lord Arthur Goring\n*[[Julianne Moore]] as Mrs. Laura Cheveley\n*[[Jeremy Northam]] as Sir Robert Chiltern\n*[[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]] as Lord Caversham\n*[[Peter Vaughan]] as Phipps\n*[[Ben Pullen]] as Tommy Trafford\n*[[Marsha Fitzalan]] as Countess\n*[[Lindsay Duncan]] as Lady Markby\n*[[Neville Phillips]] as Mason\n*[[Nickolas Grace]] as Vicomte de Nanjac\n*[[Simon Russell Beale]] as Sir Edward\n*[[Anna Patrick]] as Miss Danvers\n*[[Delia Lindsay]] as Lady Basildon\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received positive reviews from critics.
