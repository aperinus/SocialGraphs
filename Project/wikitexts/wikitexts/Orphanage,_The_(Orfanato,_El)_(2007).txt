A. Bayona]]. The film stars [[Bel\u00e9n Rueda]] as Laura, [[Fernando Cayo]] as her husband, Carlos, and Roger Pr\u00edncep as their adopted son Sim\u00f3n. The plot centers on Laura, who returns to her childhood home, an orphanage. Laura plans to turn the house into a home for disabled children, but after an argument with Sim\u00f3n, he goes missing.\n\nThe film's script was written by [[Sergio G. S\u00e1nchez]] in 1996 and brought to the attention of Bayona in 2004. Bayona asked his long-time friend, director [[Guillermo del Toro]], to help produce the film and to double its budget and filming time. The Orphanage is an international co-production between Spain and Mexico. Bayona wanted the film to capture the feel of 1970s [[Cinema of Spain|Spanish cinema]]; he cast [[Geraldine Chaplin]] and [[Bel\u00e9n Rueda]], who were later praised for their roles in the film.\n\nThe film opened at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] on May 20, 2007, where it received a standing ovation lasting more than 10 minutes. It received critical acclaim from audiences in its native Spain, winning seven [[Goya awards]]. On its North American release, ''The Orphanage'' was praised by English-speaking critics, who described  the film as well directed and well acted, and noted the film's lack of \"cheap scares\"; subsequently, [[New Line Cinema]] bought the rights to the film for an American [[remake]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please help keep this section brief. Every detail of the plot does not need to appear here. -->\nIn Spain, a young girl named Laura Garc\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez  is adopted from an [[orphanage]]. 30 years later, adult Laura ([[Bel\u00e9n Rueda]]) returns to the closed orphanage, accompanied by her husband, Carlos S\u00e1nchez Rivera ([[Fernando Cayo]]), and their seven-year-old son, Sim\u00f3n (Roger Pr\u00edncep). She plans to reopen the orphanage as a facility for [[disabled]] children. Sim\u00f3n claims to have befriended a boy named Tom\u00e1s, and draws pictures of him as a child wearing a sack mask. [[Social work]]er Benigna Escobedo ([[Montserrat Carulla]]) visits the house to inquire after Sim\u00f3n, and it is revealed that Laura and Carlos adopted Sim\u00f3n and that he is [[HIV-positive people|HIV positive]]. Incensed at Benigna's intrusion, Laura asks her to leave. Later that night, Laura finds Benigna in the orphanage's coal shed, but Benigna flees the scene. Later, Sim\u00f3n teaches Laura a game which grants its winner a wish. Clues lead the two to Sim\u00f3n's adoption file. Sim\u00f3n becomes angry, and says that his new friend told him that Laura is not his biological mother and that he is going to die soon.\n\nDuring a party for the orphanage's opening, Laura and Sim\u00f3n argue, and Sim\u00f3n hides from her after she slaps him in the face in a fit of frustration, which she immediately regrets. While looking for him, she encounters a child wearing a sack mask who shoves her into a bathroom and locks her inside. When Laura escapes, she realizes that Sim\u00f3n is missing and is unable to find him. That night, Laura hears several loud crashes within the walls of the orphanage. Police psychologist Pilar ([[Mabel Rivera]]) suggests to Laura and Carlos that Benigna may have abducted Sim\u00f3n.\n\nSix months later, Sim\u00f3n is still missing. While searching for him, Laura spots Benigna, who is then struck and killed by an ambulance. The police find evidence that Benigna worked at the orphanage, and that she had a son named Tom\u00e1s, who also lived there but was kept hidden due to his facial deformity. A few weeks after Laura was adopted, the orphans stole the mask that Tom\u00e1s wore to conceal his deformed face. Embarrassed, Tom\u00e1s refused to leave his hiding place in a nearby [[sea cave]], and the rising tide drowned him.\n\nLaura asks for the assistance of a [[Mediumship|medium]] named Aurora ([[Geraldine Chaplin]]) in the search for Sim\u00f3n. Aurora conducts a [[seance]] during which she claims to see the [[ghost]]s of the orphans crying for help. Laura discovers the remains of the orphans she grew up with in the orphanage. Benigna poisoned their meals and killed them for having caused Tom\u00e1s's death and hid their remains in the orphanage's coal shed.<ref name=\"UKinterview\" /> <!-- this is cited to note that it's not a furnace as once written. In the interview with the director he says it's a coal shed --> Unable to cope with the situation, Carlos leaves the orphanage.\n\nLaura makes the orphanage look as it did thirty years ago and attempts to contact the children's spirits by playing one of their old games. The spirits lead her to the door of a hidden underground room. Inside is Sim\u00f3n's corpse, wearing Tom\u00e1s's mask. Laura finally realizes what happened: while searching for Sim\u00f3n the night he disappeared, Laura moved pieces of construction [[scaffolding]], blocking the entrance to the secret room. The crashes that night were caused by Sim\u00f3n trying to get out. He fell and fatally broke his neck.\n\nLaura appears to take an overdose of sleeping pills. Then, apparently dying, she begs to be with Sim\u00f3n again and the children's spirits appear, with Sim\u00f3n among them. Sim\u00f3n tells Laura that his wish was for her to stay and take care of the orphans, she then happily tells them a story. Sometime later, Carlos visits a memorial to Laura, Sim\u00f3n and the orphans. Carlos returns to the orphans' old bedroom and finds a medallion that he had given to Laura. He turns to look as the door opens, and he smiles.<!-- Do not add the speculation that the ghost of Laura is present when the door opens, as it is not explicitly shown in the film. -->\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bel\u00e9n Rueda]] as Laura Garc\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez, the wife of Carlos and adoptive mother of Sim\u00f3n. Laura returns to the orphanage where she spent some of her youth to turn it into a home for disabled children. Mireia Renau portrays the younger Laura.\n* [[Fernando Cayo]] as Carlos S\u00e1nchez Rivera, the husband of Laura and adoptive father of Sim\u00f3n.\n* Roger Pr\u00edncep as Sim\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Rivera, the young adopted son of Laura and Carlos. Sim\u00f3n meets new imaginary friends in the orphanage and eventually threatens to run away with them.\n* [[Mabel Rivera]] as Pilar, the head police psychologist who eventually discovers the truth of who Benigna really is.\n* [[Montserrat Carulla]] as Benigna Escobedo, a former worker at the orphanage who identifies herself as a social worker. When she is seen young in the film, she is portrayed by Carol Su\u00e1rez.<ref name=\"allmoviecast\">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:389195~T2 |title=Allmovie > The Orphanage > Cast |access-date=2008-10-27 |publisher=Allmovie }}</ref> Production companies working with Bayona tried to urge him to keep this character alive until the end of the film.<ref name=\"filmmakermag\">{{cite web |url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/directorinterviews/2007/12/juan-antonio-bayona-orphanage.php |title=The Director Interviews |access-date=2008-10-27 |publisher=Filmmaker Magazine|date=28 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807175329/http://filmmakermagazine.com/directorinterviews/2007/12/juan-antonio-bayona-orphanage.php <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archive-date=7 August 2008}}</ref>\n* [[Geraldine Chaplin]] as Aurora, the medium brought in to help find Sim\u00f3n when the police can't find him.\n* [[Andr\u00e9s Gertr\u00fadix]] as Enrique, Aurora's sound technician.\n* [[Edgar Vivar]] as Professor Leo Balab\u00e1n, a parapsychology expert who puts Laura in contact with Aurora and directs the spirit session in her house.\n* [[\u00d3scar Casas]] as Tom\u00e1s, the deformed son of Benigna who Sim\u00f3n claims to have befriended.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe first draft of the script of ''The Orphanage'' was written by [[Sergio G.
