Their marriage, once the most important thing to both, has lost all meaning. Francesco loses interest in Marta, prompting her to start an affair with their business partner.\n\nFrancesco's aunt Anita, the [[black sheep]] of the family, dies in [[Istanbul]], where Francesco goes to try to sell the property he has inherited as quickly as possible.\n\nThe family who had managed the property under Anita's supervision and direction welcomes him with hospitality, but they are concerned about what the future holds for them. Their young son Mehmet ([[Mehmet G\u00fcns\u00fcr]]) is particularly eager to show their handsome guest around.\n\nWhen Francesco discovers the property includes a derelict ''hamam'', a [[Turkish bath]], he instead decides to restore the ''hamam'' and reopen it to the public. During the restoration, he starts a relationship with Mehmet.<ref>[[:it:File:Il bagno turco.JPG|Steam-Scene]]</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Marta arrives in Istanbul to get a speedy divorce from Francesco, but she is taken aback when she realizes how much Francesco has changed from his old self: both the ''hamam'' and Mehmet's unconditional affection were just what he needed, giving him back a purpose in life. Marta falls in love with him again, causing Rome and the divorce to lose importance for her.\n\nFrancesco's unwillingness to sell the property makes him enemies, some of whom ultimately murder him.\n\nMarta decides to stay in Istanbul and run the ''hamam'', the final scene suggesting she has turned into a second Anita.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alessandro Gassman]] as Francesco\n* [[Francesca d'Aloja]] as Marta\n* [[Carlo Cecchi]] as Oscar\n* [[Halil Erg\u00fcn]] as Osman\n* [[Serif Sezer]] as Perran\n* [[Mehmet G\u00fcns\u00fcr]] as Mehmet\n* [[Basak K\u00f6kl\u00fckaya]] as Fusun\n* [[Alberto Molinari]] as Paolo\n* [[Zozo Toledo]] as Zozo\n* [[Ludovica Modugno]] as Voice of Aunt Anita (voice)\n\nOther cast members; Zerrin Arbas, Necdet Mahfi Ayral, Murat Ilker and Alper Kul\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0119248|title=Hamam}}\n\n{{Ferzan \u00d6zpetek}}\n{{GoldenOrangeAwardBestFilm}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hamam}}\n[[Category:1997 drama films]]\n[[Category:1997 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ferzan \u00d6zpetek]]\n[[Category:Films set in Istanbul]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Golden Orange Award for Best Film winners]]\n[[Category:Italian LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Spanish LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Turkish LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related drama films]]\n[[Category:1997 multilingual films]]\n[[Category:Spanish multilingual films]]\n[[Category:Turkish multilingual films]]\n[[Category:Italian multilingual films]]\n[[Category:1990s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s Turkish-language films]]\n\n\n{{LGBT-drama-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
