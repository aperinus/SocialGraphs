Thompson (screenwriter)|Robert E. Thompson]] and [[James Poe]], based on [[Horace McCoy]]'s [[They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (novel)|1935 novel of the same name]], and starring [[Jane Fonda]], [[Michael Sarrazin]], [[Susannah York]], [[Gig Young]], [[Bonnie Bedelia]] and [[Red Buttons]]. It focuses on a disparate group of individuals desperate to win a [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era [[dance marathon]] and an opportunistic [[Master of ceremonies|emcee]] who urges them on.\n\nThe film was released theatrically in the United States on December 10, 1969, and also premiered at the [[1970 Cannes Film Festival]]. The film became a critical and commercial success, grossing $12.6&nbsp;million on a budget of $4.86&nbsp;million, becoming the [[1969 in film|seventeenth highest-grossing film of 1969]]. Reviewers praised its direction, screenplay, depiction of the depression era, and performances (especially of Fonda, York and Young). It received nine nominations at the [[42nd Academy Awards]] including; [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]],  [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Fonda),  [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (for York), [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], with Young winning for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. As of {{CURRENT YEAR}}, it holds the record for most Oscar nominations without one for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nRobert Syverton is a homeless man, who recalls the events leading to an unstated crime. As a boy, he saw a horse breaking its leg, after which it was shot and put out of misery. Years later, in the [[Great Depression]], he wanders into a [[dance marathon]] about to begin in the shabby ballroom, near the [[Pacific Ocean]] on the [[Santa Monica Pier]]. Robert is recruited by Rocky, the contest's promoter and emcee, as a substitute partner of a selfish woman Gloria Beatty, after her original partner is disqualified due to [[bronchitis]].\n\nAmong other marathon contestants, competing for a prize of $1,500 in silver dollars, and hoping to be spotted by Hollywood celebrities and talent scouts in the audience, including retired sailor Harry Kline, emotionally-fragile aspiring [[London]] actress Alice, her partner and aspiring actor Joel, impoverished farmer James and his pregnant wife Ruby. Early in the marathon, the weaker pairs are eliminated quickly, while Rocky observes the vulnerabilities of the stronger contestants and exploits them for the audience's amusement. The arena employs [[quackery|quack]] doctors to cover up the extreme physical and mental damage to participants. Frayed nerves are exacerbated by the theft for one of Alice's dresses (especially Rocky using it in order to create artificial drama and entertain the audience) and Gloria's displeasure at the attention Alice receives from Robert. In retaliation, Alice takes Harry as her partner, after Joel leaves the competition for a job. Weeks into the marathon, in order to spark the paying spectators' enthusiasm, Rocky stages a series of derbies, in which the exhausted contestants run around the dance floor, with the last three couples eliminated. After Harry dies of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], the undeterred Gloria carries him and crosses the finish line. Rocky disqualifies Harry and the medics remove his body from the dance floor. This incident causes Alice to have a [[nervous breakdown]]. When Alice showers with clothes, Rocky comforts with Alice and removes her from the competition. Lacking partners, Gloria and Robert again pair up.\n\nRocky suggests the two to marry during the marathon, a publicity stunt guaranteed to earn more cash for them, in the form of gifts from supporters, such as Mrs. Laydon, a wealthy woman sponsoring them throughout the contest. When Gloria refuses, Rocky reveals the contest's [[invoice]] paper sheet: expenses will be deducted from the prize money, leaving the winner with close to nothing. Gloria and Robert leave the competition. While packing up her things, Gloria searches for one of her silk stockings. When Robert finds the damaged one, she breaks down. The two leave the dance hall and stand on the pier near the beach. Gloria confesses to Robert how empty she feels, and that she is tired of her life. Gloria equips a gun, but cannot bring herself to pull the trigger. She desperately asks Robert to kill her, which he does. When the arresting police asks him why he did it, Robert replies. The marathon continues with a few remaining couples, having gone up to 1,491 hours.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jane Fonda]] as Gloria Beatty\n* [[Michael Sarrazin]] as Robert Syverton\n* [[Susannah York]] as Alice LeBlanc\n* [[Gig Young]] as Rocky Gravo\n* [[Red Buttons]] as Harry Kline (Sailor)\n* [[Bonnie Bedelia]] as Ruby Bates\n* [[Michael Conrad]] as Rollo\n* [[Bruce Dern]] as James Bates\n* [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]] as \"Turkey\"\n* [[Robert Fields]] as Joel Girard\n* [[Severn Darden]] as Cecil\n* [[Allyn Ann McLerie]] as Shirl\n* [[Madge Kennedy]] as Mrs. Laydon\n* Jacquelyn Hyde as Jackie\n* [[Felice Orlandi]] as Mario\n* [[Arthur Metrano]] as Max\n* [[Paul Mantee]] as \"Jiggs\"\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nIn the early 1950s, [[Norman Lloyd]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]] were looking for a project on which to collaborate, with Lloyd as director and Chaplin as producer. Lloyd purchased the rights to [[Horace McCoy]]'s novel for $3,000 and planned to cast Chaplin's son, [[Sydney Chaplin (American actor)|Sydney]], and newcomer [[Marilyn Monroe]] in the lead roles. Once arrangements were completed, in 1952 Chaplin took [[Chaplin family|his family]] on what was intended to be a brief trip to the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[London]] premiere of ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]''. During this trip, in part because Chaplin was accused of being a [[Communism|Communist]] supporter during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]], FBI head [[J. Edgar Hoover]] negotiated with the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] to revoke his re-entry permit and the film project was cancelled. When the rights to the book reverted to McCoy's heirs sixteen years later (he had died in 1955), they refused to renew the deal with Lloyd, since nothing had come of his original plans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/movies/article450062.ece|first=Steve|last=Persall|title=Everybody knows Norman|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410195436/http://www.tampabay.com/features/movies/article450062.ece# |archive-date=April 10, 2008|work=[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]]|date=April 10, 2008}}</ref>\n\nA script was written by James Poe, who wanted to direct. The rights were bought by Palomar Pictures, whose president was then Edgar Scherick. Scherick offered the project to the producing team of Bob Chartoff and Irwin Winkler, who were enthusiastic, but felt the script needed a rewrite and that they would struggle to make the film for Scherick's desired budget of $900,000. They also had concerns about Poe's ability as a director and worried that he was too arrogant.<ref name=\"wink\">{{cite book|first=Irwin|last=Winkler|title=A Life in Movies: Stories from Fifty Years in Hollywood|pages=525\u2013726/3917|edition=Kindle|publisher=Abrams Press|year=2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Mia Farrow]] was interested in starring but Scherick felt her fee of $500,000 was too high. Eventually it was agreed to show the script to Jane Fonda, who was interested. [[Michael Sarrazin]] was borrowed from Universal to play the male lead. Scherick eventually agreed to raise the budget to $4&nbsp;million. [[Martin Baum (agent)]] became head of ABC Pictures and Winkler says Baum arranged for Scherick to be fired. Baum wanted the second female lead to be played by Susannah York though Poe had promised the role to his then-girlfriend. Winkler says it was Baum who suggested Red Buttons and Gig Young, and pushed for Poe to be fired. The producers were reluctant especially as Jane Fonda liked Poe and had director approval. Winkler arranged for Poe to direct a screen test for [[Bonnie Bedelia]] with Fonda; the test did not go well and Fonda became less enthusiastic about Poe's capabilities as a director. Poe was fired from the project.<ref name=\"wink\"/>\n\nThe main candidates to replace Poe were [[William Friedkin]], [[Sydney Pollack]] and [[Jack Smight]]. According to Winkler, Smight wanted $250,000, Friedkin wanted $200,000 and Pollack was willing to do it for $150,000. Pollack got the job.<ref name=\"wink\"/>\n\nFonda said she was originally unimpressed by the script, but her husband [[Roger Vadim]], who saw similarities between the book and works of the [[existentialism|French existentialists]], urged her to reconsider.{{sfn|Fonda|2006|p=202}}\n\nMeeting with Pollack to discuss the script, she was surprised when he asked for her opinion. She later said, \"It was the first time a director asked me for input on how I saw the character and the story.\"  She read the script with a critical eye, made notes on the character and later observed in her [[autobiography]], \"It was a germinal moment [for me]&nbsp;... This was the first time in my life as an actor that I was working on a film about larger societal issues, and instead of my professional work feeling peripheral to life, it felt relevant.\" Troubled about problems in her marriage at the time, she drew on her personal anguish to help her with her characterization.{{sfn|Fonda|2006|pages=207\u2013216}}\n\nPollack had the script rewritten by Robert Thompson.<ref name=\"wink\"/>\n\n[[Warren Beatty]] originally was considered for the role of Robert Syverton and Pollack's first choice for Rocky was [[character actor]] [[Lionel Stander]].<ref name=\"ew.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,293121,00.html|last=Simels|first=Steve|date=June 21, 1996|title=They Shoot Horses, Don't They?|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200913202432/https://ew.com/article/1996/06/21/they-shoot-horses-dont-they/|archive-date=September 13, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"tcm.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=151877&mainArticleId=151863|title=They Shoot Horses, Don't They?|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|access-date=23 June 2018|archive-date=16 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016181831/http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=151877&mainArticleId=151863|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Shooting===\nDuring filming there was an issue with Susannah York, who wanted a guarantee she would be able to make ''Country Dance''. When this was not forthcoming, it seemed she would have to be replaced and Pollack suggested [[Sally Kellerman]]. However, York relented and agreed to make the film.<ref name=\"wink\"/>\n\nThe film uses the unusual technique of [[flashforward]] (glimpses of the future). It occurs during the last 18 minutes of the film, as passages appear foreshadowing the fate of Robert, just before the tragic ending. Costar Gig Young was noted for his deep characterization of Rocky: he patterned his character after the bandleader and radio personality [[Ben Bernie]], and used Bernie's famous [[catchphrase]], \"[[:wikt:yowza|Yowza!]] Yowza! Yowza!\", for the character in the film.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe film's soundtrack features numerous [[Traditional pop music|standards]] from the era.

In addition to everything else it does, \"''Horses''\" holds our attention because it tells us something we didn't know about human nature and American society. It tells us a lot more than that, of course, but because it works on this fundamental level as well. It is one of the best American movies of the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/balder-and-dash/they-shot-horses-didnt-they|title=They Shot Horses, Didn't They?|last=Ebert|first=Roger|author-link=Roger Ebert|date=January 16, 2011|work=RogerEbert.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180804141022/https://www.rogerebert.com/balder-and-dash/they-shot-horses-didnt-they|archive-date=August 4, 2018|access-date=August 4, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Vincent Canby]] said,\n<blockquote>The movie is far from being perfect, but it is so disturbing in such important ways that I won't forget it very easily, which is more than can be said of much better, more consistent films&nbsp;... The movie is by far the best thing that Pollack has ever directed (with the possible exception of ''[[The Scalphunters]]''). While the cameras remain, as if they had been sentenced, within the ballroom, picking up the details of the increasing despair of the dancers, the movie becomes an epic of exhaustion and futility.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/12/11/archives/pollacks-they-shoot-horses-opens-at-the-fine-artstheme-based-on.html|title=Pollack's 'They Shoot Horses' Opens at the Fine Arts:Theme Based on Novel by Horace McCoy|last=Canby|first=Vincent|author-link=Vincent Canby|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 11, 1969|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201210183026/https://www.nytimes.com/1969/12/11/archives/pollacks-they-shoot-horses-opens-at-the-fine-artstheme-based-on.html|archive-date=December 10, 2020|access-date=November 30, 2021}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, \"Puffy-eyed, unshaven, reeking of stale liquor, sweat and cigarettes, Young has never looked older or acted better.

Pollack does one of his best jobs of directing, even if his primary strength lies in his rapport with actors.
