It is told in three parts, in which all telecommunication and audiovisual devices transmit only a mysterious signal turning people mad and activating murderous behaviour in many of those affected.\n\nThe film's three interconnected chapters (\"[[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmissions]]\") are presented in a [[nonlinear narrative]]. Each of them manifests elements of (besides the overall genre of [[psychological horror]]), respectively, [[splatter film]], [[black comedy]], and a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[romance film|love story]]. ''The Signal'' was met with a mixed but largely positive critical reception.\n\n==Plot==\nMya is cheating on her husband Lewis with Ben. Ben asks Mya to leave the city with him, but she remains noncommittal. As Mya exits, Ben turns the television on and watches a bizarre, [[psychedelia|psychedelic]] sequence of images. Mya listens to a compact disc given to her by Ben, but she is menaced by men who are acting strangely in a parking garage. When she reaches her apartment building, she finds more people behaving strangely. Unknown to Mya, a static-like interference coming through communications media has amplified people's negative emotional traits, causing them to act irrationally and, in most cases, violently.\n\n===Transmission 1: Crazy in Love===\nWritten and directed by [[David Bruckner]].\n\nOnce inside her apartment, Lewis and two friends, Jerry and Rod, attempt to fix the TV, but Lewis beats Jerry to death over a minor argument. Mya flees in panic, leaving Rod and Lewis in a struggle, but finds the whole building in chaos. Mya hides in a nearby apartment until morning. When she re-enters her home, she finds Lewis unconscious and bound to a chair. He awakens to see her leave while listening to Ben's compact disc. Mya encounters Rod, who drags her into a janitor's closet and tells her of his struggle to survive. It becomes evident that the signal affects each person differently, and Rod may also be crazy, though he seems to largely have control of his judgment. Together, they escape and attempt to drive to safety. But after being shot by a policewoman and almost left behind by Mya, Rod becomes more violent and attacks Mya, who crashes the car. Rod is incapacitated and trapped in the vehicle, while Mya flees, telling a stranger named Clark that she is going to the train station.\n\n===Transmission 2: The Jealousy Monster===\nWritten and directed by [[Jacob Gentry]].\n\nBen finds Lewis duct-taped and loosens his bonds. Lewis knocks Ben unconscious and puts him in the back of a pest control van. At a nearby apartment, a woman named Anna has killed her husband in self-defense but has continued planning for a party as if nothing has happened. Clark, Anna's neighbor and a conspiracy theorist, soon arrives. The two attempt to understand what is happening, and Clark admits that he decapitated Rod after Rod violently attacked him. Eventually Lewis arrives at the apartment after seeing Mya's crashed car. At first, Lewis befriends Anna and Clark, and they convince themselves that none of them have been affected by the signal. Lewis' violent and paranoid tendencies cause him to kill Anna's niece, Laura, who arrives seeking help. He dismisses the act as defending Anna, but Clark convinces him not to attack the next arrival, Jim, who is apparently oblivious of the situation. While Anna hallucinates that Clark is her husband, Lewis hallucinates that Jim is Ben, taunting him. He beats Jim to death, pins Clark to a chair using kitchen knives, and blinds Anna with insecticide. Convinced she knows nothing about Mya, Lewis forces Anna to ingest the poison. He exposes Clark to the signal interrogates him. Ben, having woken up and freed himself from Lewis's van, enters the apartment and knocks out Lewis.\n\n===Transmission 3: Escape from Terminus===\nWritten and directed by [[Dan Bush]].\n\nLewis wakes up and follows Ben and Clark. He attempts to kill them in a tool shed, but they fight him off and escape. Ben convinces Clark the signal is a lie, breaking its effect on him, and Clark informs Ben where Mya was headed. Ben and Clark run through the now mostly-dead city and arrive at the train station. There, they find Mya tied to a chair, being forced to watch the signal by Lewis. Lewis attacks them and strangles Clark to unconsciousness. Ben uses Lewis's own paranoia against him, tricking Lewis into believing that their roles are reversed. Lewis punches a signal-broadcasting TV in a frustrated rage, electrocuting himself.\n\nThe story ends ambiguously. Ben, Mya, and Clark stock up on supplies, then Clark leaves.  However, the next scene reveals Mya still tied to the chair, seemingly catatonic. Ben places Mya's headphones on her, and she closes her eyes, a tear rolling down her cheek.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anessa Ramsey]] as Mya Denton\n* [[Justin Welborn]] as Ben Capstone\n* [[AJ Bowen]] as Lewis Denton\n* Scott Poythress as Clark\n* [[Sahr Ngaujah]] (as Sahr) as Rod\n* Cheri Christian as Anna\n* Chad McKnight (as Chadrian McKnight) as Jim\n* Matthew Stanton (as Matt Stanton) as Jerry\n* Suehyla El-Attar as Janice\n\n==Production and release==\n''The Signal'' was created by four filmmakers who have been collaborating since 1999 in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] and each of its chapters of which had different directors during shooting.
