It is the sixth [[List of Doctor Who Christmas specials|''Doctor Who'' Christmas special]] since the programme's revival in 2005, and was broadcast on 25 December 2010 on both [[BBC One]] and [[BBC America]], making it the first episode to premiere on the same day in both the United Kingdom and United States. It was written by [[Steven Moffat]] and directed by [[Toby Haynes]].\n\nIn the episode, a crashing space liner with more than four thousand people on board has been caught in a strange cloud belt. The alien [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] [[Eleventh Doctor|the Doctor]] ([[Matt Smith]]) lands on the planet below and meets the miserly Kazran Sardick ([[Michael Gambon]]), a man who can control the cloud layer but refuses to help. Inspired by [[Charles Dickens]]'s 1843 novella ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', the episode has the Doctor attempting to use time travel to alter Kazran's past and make him kinder so that he will save the spaceship.\n\nMoffat enjoyed writing the episode and was a fan of Dickens' story himself. The story features flying sharks and fish, which were things Moffat was afraid of as a child. The episode features the acting debut of Welsh singer [[Katherine Jenkins]], who also sang in the episode with a song written specifically for her. \"A Christmas Carol\" was filmed through July and August 2010 mainly on sets designed by the show's new set designer Michael Pickwoad. The special was seen by 12.11 million viewers in the UK and received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Synopsis===\nA space liner carrying more than four thousand passengers loses control when passing through strange electrified clouds over a human-inhabited planet. The [[Eleventh Doctor]] discovers the clouds are controlled by the bitter old man Kazran Sardick, who refuses to allow the ship to land safely. Discovering Kazran's fear of his father, the inventor of the cloud controlling machine, and his wish to never be like him, the Doctor travels to Kazran's past to change it. Meeting Kazran as a young boy, the Doctor uses his [[sonic screwdriver]] to summon a shark that swims in the clouds and fog. The shark eats the screwdriver, wounding it, and is unable to swim back to the clouds. To save the shark, Kazran takes her to a [[cryogenics]] storeroom where Kazran's father has kept people in storage as \"security\" for loans, including a woman called Abigail. Abigail, once released, sings to soothe the shark while the Doctor uses Abigail's cryo-unit to transport the shark back to the skies. As the Doctor and Kazran return Abigail to storage, Kazran promises her they will see her every Christmas Eve. The Doctor keeps this promise, and romance blooms between Kazran and Abigail. However, after one such visit, Kazran requests the Doctor end the practice, keeping Abigail in storage indefinitely as Abigail has an incurable illness and one day left to live. Though old Kazran in the present is pleased with his new memories, he remains bitter at Abigail's fate and refuses to help save the ship.\n\nOld Kazran is soon visited by holographic images of the ship's crew and passengers in the present, imploring Kazran's help, but he waves away the holograms. The Doctor appears, bringing young Kazran with him to show the child Kazran his future; the realisation of how much his bitter future self now resembles his feared father causes Kazran to change his mind and decide to save the ship. The Doctor finds his changes to Kazran's past have locked him out from the controls of Kazran's father's machine. The Doctor instead has Abigail sing through one half of the broken sonic screwdriver; the other half, still in the shark, resonates in the atmosphere, disrupting the storm to allow the ship to land safely. Kazran releases Abigail knowing this will be the last time, but Abigail understands and believes it is time for them to share a Christmas Day.\n\n===Continuity===\nSeveral nods to earlier outfits in the series appear in \"A Christmas Carol\". [[Amy Pond]] wears her kissogram policewoman's outfit from [[Doctor Who (series 5)|Series 5]]'s \"[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]\", while [[Rory Williams]] wears a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] centurion's outfit as seen in \"[[The Pandorica Opens]]\" and \"[[A Good Man Goes to War]]\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Steven|last=Cooper|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2010/12/doctor-who-2010-christmas-special-a-christmas-carol/|title=Doctor Who: 2010 Christmas Special \"A Christmas Carol\"|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=29 December 2010|access-date=5 March 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"BrilliantBook\">{{cite book |last1=Hickman |first1=Clayton |author-link1=Clayton Hickman |editor1-last=Hickman |editor1-first=Clayton |title=The Brilliant Book 2012 |date=2011 |publisher=BBC Books |location=London, England |isbn=978-1849902304 |page=84 |language=en}}</ref> In one of the many Christmas Eves the Doctor and Kazran spend with Abigail, they present themselves to her in long, stripy scarves, the [[Fourth Doctor]]'s trademark accessory.<ref name=\"SFX review\" /> The two also appear in fezzes, an item of clothing the Doctor became fond of in \"[[The Big Bang (Doctor Who)|The Big Bang]]\".<ref name=\"SFX review\" /><ref name=\"TV Squad\">{{cite web | url = http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/12/27/doctor-who-a-christmas-carol-recap/ | title = 'Doctor Who' \u2013 'A Christmas Carol' Recap | date = 27 December 2010| access-date = 31 December 2010| first = Brad | last = Trechak | publisher = [[TV Squad]] }}</ref> Kazran's controls are \"isomorphic\", which means that only he can use them.

Instead he was more of a \"damaged\" character; the Doctor recognises this when Kazran demonstrates his inability to hit a little boy, due to it reminding him of when his father beat him. This allowed the Doctor to want to change his past and \"defrost\" his soul. The phrase \"halfway out of the dark\" is used in the episode, a reference to the fact that the hard winter is almost over as well as a metaphor for Kazran.<ref name=\"confidential\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Katherine Jenkins - Live 2011 (8).jpg|200px|thumb|left|Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins makes her acting debut in the episode.]]\nStarting with this episode, [[Arthur Darvill]] achieved regular status as [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] Rory.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Burk|first1=Graeme|last2=Smith?|first2=Robert|title=Who Is the Doctor: The Unofficial Guide to Doctor Who-The New Series|chapter=Series 6|edition=1st|date=6 March 2012|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/whoisdoctorunoff0000burk/page/335 335]|isbn=978-1550229844|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/whoisdoctorunoff0000burk/page/335}}</ref> British actor [[Michael Gambon]] was cast in the role of Kazran.

Pickwoad and Haynes worked together to create the town, incorporating elements that would be needed in a society that shared its daily life with fish. Nearly all windows in the town are round, reminiscent of submarines. The structures were made out of metal, filmed at a local steel works.<ref name=\"confidential\" /> Kazran's study was designed to be very large, as Kazran spent several scenes in there alone and would feel \"dwarfed\" by it. The walls were intended to look like copper that had turned green, which when combined with the red drapes created the Christmas colours of red and green.<ref name=\"confidential\" /> The painting of Kazran's father was created by taking a picture of Gambon, lightly printing it on a canvas, and painting in the details.<ref name=\"confidential\" /> Kazran's controls were inspired by a [[church organ]].<ref name=\"confidential\" />\n\nThe Doctor's first scene in the episode is falling down the chimney and presenting himself to Kazran. Smith was pleased with the entrance of his character, noting similarities between the Doctor and [[Santa Claus]]. However, a stuntman performed the scene.<ref name=\"confidential\" /> For the scene in which a sky fish nibbles on the sonic screwdriver, the screwdriver was dangled in front of a [[greenscreen]] and tapped with a pen to create the effect of the fish nudging it.<ref name=\"confidential\" /> To maintain secrecy of the episode's plot, the model shark was given the codename \"Clive\".<ref name=\"confidential\" /> The scenes in which the characters ride through the air in a sleigh pulled by one of the flying sharks was filmed in front of a greenscreen. The sleigh was in fact a [[cycle rickshaw|rickshaw]] which crew members rocked back and forth as a wind machine created the effect of flying through the air. As it was impossible to film underneath the rickshaw, a miniature model of the sleigh was used for the shots underneath the sleigh rather than computer-generated effects.<ref name=\"confidential\" />\n\n===Music===\nThe episode features a song specifically written for Jenkins, titled \"Abigail's Song\". In the script it was written that the song was unique and specific to ''Doctor Who'', and composer [[Murray Gold]] was contacted to write the song. Jenkins did a demo and then sang the song while filming the actual scene, as she thought it would look more natural. Afterwards she sang the final version and a new, lighter arrangement was composed by the National Orchestra of Wales.<ref name=\"confidential\" /> Selected pieces of music from this special, as composed by Gold, were released on [[Doctor Who: Original Television Soundtrack - A Christmas Carol|a soundtrack]] 21 March 2011 by Silva Screen Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Doctor-Who-Christmas-Murray-Gold/dp/B004GXCMIA|title=Doctor Who: A Christmas Carol (Soundtrack)|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|access-date=5 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast and reception==\n\"A Christmas Carol\" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on [[BBC One]] on Christmas Day 2010.
