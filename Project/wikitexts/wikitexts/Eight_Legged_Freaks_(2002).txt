The plot follows a cluster of [[spiders]] that is exposed to toxic waste, causing them to mutate into gigantic, monstrous creatures and attack a small American mining town.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|date=January 2021}}\nOn a highway outside of the quiet mining town of Prosperity, Arizona, a truck driver carrying a load of chemicals swerves to avoid a rabbit, causing a barrel of toxic waste to land in a reservoir. One week later, an exotic spider farmer named Joshua Taft shows Michael \"Mike\" Parker, a local boy, his collection, including an enormous female [[Orb-weaver spider|Orb Weaver]] from Brazil named Consuela. After Mike leaves, Joshua is bitten by an escaped tarantula and accidentally knocks down the spider cages. He, along with his pet parrot, is killed by the spiders and, after devouring him, the spiders grow to even larger proportions by the toxins of the crickets Joshua feeds them.\n\nAnother week later, Christopher \"Chris\" McCormick, whose father owned the mines before he died ten years ago, shows up and stands against Wade, the mayor of Prosperity, about his proposition to sell the mine as he believes that his father had discovered a gold vein in the mine. Chris also sparks a romance with Sam, the town sheriff. Meanwhile, Wade is holding a town meeting in the mall about whether they should sell the mines and relocate. Wade later on insults Chris's father for being delusional for thinking that there are golds in the mine only to be punched by Chris. Mike sneaks out on foot and finds Joshua and the spiders missing, the farm covered in webbing, and the dead body of Joshua. Although he sees an enormous spider shadow in the mines and tells Chris that the spiders have grown to enormous sizes, based on a giant spider leg he found at the mine entrance, Chris doesn't believe him.\n\nSeeing as the entire town is connected in some way to the mines, spiders show up in many different places. Harlan Griffiths, an eccentric [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] enthusiast, is broadcasting his theory that various missing pets around town have been abducted by extraterrestrials. Ashley, Sam's daughter, breaks up with her boyfriend Bret, before he and his motorcyclist friends are chased by [[jumping spider]]s, with him being the only survivor, accidentally cutting off the telephone line and being stuck in the mine. Chris finds out that his Aunt Gladys and her dog are abducted by a male orb weaver in their basement. Sam is convinced Chris and Mike are delusional. However, they were right all along when Sam witnesses a giant male orb-weaver attempting to abduct Ashley and Chris. Sam kills the spider with a shotgun and saves them both before contacting Pete to tell him to bring all guns in the police station's possession, later on escaped to Harlan's trailer, knowing he has a radio station that he operates from within his trailer.\n\nAs Sam broadcasts the threat over the radio, a giant [[tarantula]], the \"tank\" of the horde, assaults his trailer but they manage to escape. As the town is besieged by vicious spider hordes, many people are eaten, Sam tells everybody to evacuate to the mall and barricade themselves, while Wade flees into the mines and locks the gate before the attack, then defend themselves from the spiders. Harlan and Chris climb onto the roof and ascend the radio mast and try to get a signal to call the army as they are being attacked by the spiders, but are believed to be pranksters. Harlan jumps from the roof, after the tarantula breaks open the gates and lets the spiders enter the mall, and lands in some bushes, where he meets up with Pete.\n\nWhile the townsfolk are in the basement, Bret arrives on a forklift that brings down the locked gate, and they all head to through the mines straight to the front entrance, discovering the methane-filled tunnels. After freeing Wade, Chris goes to look for his Aunt Gladys in the mines and finds her and the gold vein his father had claimed to have discovered. Joyous to realize that his father is not delusional like Wade or many people claim, this moment of joy is cut short and they are confronted by the gigantic Consuela. Using perfume to distract the spider and escaping on Bret's motorcycle, Chris then blows up the spiders and the mines utilizing Gladys's smoking addiction and the high concentrations of [[methane gas]], blowing up the mall benathen the ground before the police arrived. Wade is distraught at the destruction of the mall and hopes that the insurance will cover the damages.\n\nAs the story ends, Harlan concludes his radio report that the town has decided to cover up the whole incident, but have let Harlan continue broadcasting the incident, and Chris reopened the mine, informing that to be another story by giving a toothy smile, revealing several golden teeth.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[David Arquette]] as Chris McCormick\n* [[Kari Wuhrer]] as Sheriff Samantha Parker\n* [[Scott Terra]] as Mike Parker\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Ashley Parker\n* [[Doug E.

The mall was demolished a year after shooting was completed and redeveloped; its demolition was featured in the film as a consequence of the tunnel's methane gas explosion.\n* The scenes in Aunt Gladys's house in the kitchen and in Gladys' basement were filmed at the [[Manistee Ranch]] in Glendale, directly adjacent to the mall itself.\n* Some of the town scenes were shot in the old copper mining town of [[Superior, Arizona]].\n* The gas station scene was shot in [[Black Canyon City, Arizona]].\n\n; Spiders used in the film\n* [[Jumping spider]]\n* [[Orb-weaver spider]] (Consuela (Matriarch of the Spider Army) and her fellow male Orb-weavers)\n* [[Tarantula]] (Tank the [[Avicularia avicularia|Pinktoe Tarantula]]: Second-in-command of the Spider Army)\n* [[Trapdoor spider]]\n* [[Spitting spider]]\n* [[Tigrosa aspersa|Tiger Wolf spider]]\n; Alternate credits\n* The alternate beginning is an extended version in which Harlan does a broadcast promoting the mall, after which a worker at the mall sees Wade having the toxic waste put in the basement.\n* In the alternate ending, after the mines are blown up, the townsfolk walk down a road to get help.

Afterward, Sam and Chris kiss as the scene ends.\n\n== Release ==\nThe teaser trailer debuted in October 2001 attached to ''[[Thirteen Ghosts]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo (2002 film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' and ''[[Queen of the Damned]]''.
