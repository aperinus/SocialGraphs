Filmed in [[CinemaScope]], it was distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. It is considered among [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions|the most romantic films of all time]] according to the [[American Film Institute]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/passions.aspx |title=AFI's 100 Years\u2026100 Passions |access-date=2009-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050625071813/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/passions.aspx |archive-date=2005-06-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The film was a remake of McCarey's 1939 film ''[[Love Affair (1939 film)|Love Affair]]'', starring [[Irene Dunne]] and [[Charles Boyer]].\n\n==Plot==\nNickie Ferrante, a well-known [[Playboy lifestyle|playboy]], meets Terry McKay aboard the transatlantic ocean liner {{SS|Constitution}} en route from Europe to New York. Each is romantically involved with someone else. After a series of meetings aboard the ship, they establish a friendship. When Terry joins Nickie on a brief visit to his grandmother Janou while the ship is anchored near her home at [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]] on the Mediterranean coast, she sees Nickie with new eyes and their feelings become deeper. During their visit, Janou tells Terry that Nickie is a talented painter but destroys most of his paintings because they don't meet his standards. As the ship returns to New York City, they agree to reunite at the top of the [[Empire State Building]] in six months' time if they have succeeded in ending their relationships and starting new careers.\n\nOn the day of their rendezvous, Terry, hurrying to reach the Empire State Building, is struck down by a car while crossing a street. Gravely injured, she is rushed to the hospital. Meanwhile, Nickie, waiting for her at the observation deck at the top of the building, is unaware of the accident and, after many hours, leaves at midnight, believing that she has rejected him.\n\nAfter the accident, Terry, now unable to walk, refuses to contact Nickie because of her disability. Instead, she finds work as a music teacher. Nickie has pursued his painting and has his work displayed by Courbet, an art gallery owner. Six months after the accident, Terry sees Nickie with his former fianc\u00e9e at the ballet. Nickie does not notice her condition because she is seated, and they both say hello.\n\nNickie learns Terry's address and on Christmas Eve pays her a surprise visit. Although he tries to coax her to explain her actions, Terry dodges the subject, never leaving the couch on which she lies. He gives Terry a shawl that Janou, who has died, left for her. As he is leaving, Nickie mentions a painting on which he had been working when they first met, and that it was just given away to a woman who liked it but had no money. He is about to say that the woman was in a wheelchair when he pauses, suddenly suspecting why Terry has been lying still on the couch. He walks into her bedroom and sees the painting hanging on the wall, realizing that she was the woman in the wheelchair. The film ends with the two in a tight embrace as Terry says, \"If you can paint, I can walk. Anything can happen, don't you think?\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Nicol\u00f2 (Nickie) Ferrante\n* [[Deborah Kerr]] as Terry McKay\n* [[Richard Denning]] as Kenneth Bradley\n* [[Neva Patterson]] as Lois Clark\n* [[Cathleen Nesbitt]] as Grandmother Janou\n* [[Robert Q.
