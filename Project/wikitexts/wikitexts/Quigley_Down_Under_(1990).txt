Seeing a newspaper advertisement that asks for a man with his special talent, he answers using just four words: \"M. Quigley 900 yards\", written on a copy of the advertisement that is punctured by six closely spaced bullet holes.\n\nWhen he arrives in [[History of Australia (1851\u20131900)|Australia]], then part of the [[British Empire]], he gets into a fight with employees of the man who hired him as they try to force \"Crazy Cora\" onto their wagon. After he identifies himself, he is taken to the station of Elliot Marston, who informs Quigley his sharpshooting skills will be used to eradicate the increasingly elusive [[Aboriginal Australians]]. Quigley turns down the offer and throws Marston out of his own house. When the Aboriginal manservant knocks Quigley over the head, Marston's men beat him and Cora unconscious and dump them in the [[Outback]] with no water and little chance of survival. However, they are rescued by Aborigines.\n\nCora now reveals that she comes from [[Texas]]. When her home was attacked by [[Comanches]], she hid in the root cellar and accidentally suffocated her child while trying to prevent him from crying. Her husband had then put her alone on a ship to Australia. Now Cora consistently calls Quigley by her husband's name (Roy), much to his annoyance.\n\nWhen Marston's men attack the Aborigines who helped them, Quigley kills three. Escaping on a single horse, they encounter more of the men driving Aborigines over a cliff. Quigley drives them off with his deadly shooting and Cora rescues an orphaned baby she finds among the dead. Leaving Cora and the infant in the desert with food and water, Quigley rides alone to a nearby town. There he obtains new ammunition from a local German gunsmith, who hates Marston for his murdering ways. Quigley learns as well that he has become a legendary hero among the Aborigines.\n\nMarston's men are also in town and recognize Quigley's saddle. When they attack, cornering him in a burning building, he escapes through a skylight and kills all but one of them. The injured survivor is sent back to say Quigley will be following. But first Quigley returns to Cora and the baby, which she has just saved from an attack by [[dingoes]]. She had tried to stop that child from crying too, but finally let him make as much noise as he liked as she killed the animals using a revolver that Quigley had left for her. Back in town, Cora gives the baby to Aborigines trading there after Quigley tells her that she (Cora) has a right to happiness.\n\nNext morning, Quigley rides away to confront Marston at his station. At first he shoots the defenders from his location in the hills, but is eventually shot in the leg and captured by Marston's last two men. Marston, who has noticed that Quigley only ever carries a rifle, decides to give him a lesson in the \"quick-draw\" style of gunfighting. However, Marston and his men are beaten to the draw by Quigley; as Marston lies dying, Quigley refers to an earlier conversation, telling him, \"I said I never had much use for one [a revolver]; never said I didn't know how to use it.\"\n\nMarston's servant comes out of the house and gives Quigley his rifle back, then walks away from the ranch, stripping off his western-style clothing as he goes. An army troop now arrives to arrest Quigley, until they notice the surrounding hills are lined with Aborigines and decide to withdraw. Later Quigley and Cora book a passage back to America in the name of Cora's husband, since Quigley is still wanted. On the wharf, she reminds him that he once told her that she had to say two words before he could make love to her. Smiling broadly, she calls him \"Matthew Quigley\" and the two embrace for the first time.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tom Selleck]] as Matthew Quigley\n* [[Laura San Giacomo]] as Crazy Cora\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as Elliott Marston\n* [[Chris Haywood]] as Major Ashley-Pitt\n* [[Ron Haddrick]] as Grimmelman\n* [[Tony Bonner]] as Dobkin\n* [[Jerome Ehlers]] as Coogan\n* Conor McDermottroe as Hobb\n* [[Roger Ward]] as Brophy\n* [[Ben Mendelsohn]] as O'Flynn\n* [[Steve Dodd]] as Kunkurra\n* Karen Davitt as Slattern\n* Kylie Foster as Slattern\n* William Zappa as Reilly\n* [[Jonathan Sweet]] as Sergeant Thomas\n* Ollie Hall as Carver\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[John Hill (screenwriter)|John Hill]] first began writing ''Quigley Down Under'' in 1974. He was inspired by a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article about the genocide of the aborigines in 19th-century Australia. Although Westerns were in decline in the 1970s, Hill said that the script \"opened a lot of doors for me,\" and led to other assignments.<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nThe script was first optioned in 1979 by producer Mort Engelberg for [[Steve McQueen]], with whom he teamed on ''[[The Hunter (1980 film)|The Hunter]]''; however McQueen died of cancer shortly after completing ''The Hunter''. The script was bought by CBS Theatrical Films where it was attached to director [[Rick Rosenthal]]. It then went to Warner Bros with [[Tom Selleck]] to star and [[Lewis Gilbert]] to direct around 1987. Warner Bros had the script for three years but then dropped their option. The script then became the subject of bidding between Pathe Entertainment, Disney and Warner Bros. It sold to [[Path\u00e9]] for $250,000 which Hill said \"is pretty good, when you consider that for 15 years I'd been making money optioning and rewriting that screenplay.\"<ref name=\"los\">A Long, Dusty Trail for Selleck and Aussie Western Movies: John Hill's script for 'Quigley Down Under' endured a 15-year journey before hitting the big screen. BROESKE, PAT H. Los Angeles Times 19 October 1990: 12.</ref>\n\nPath\u00e9's then head of production, [[Alan Ladd Jr.]], agreed to commit a $20 million budget. Selleck agreed to star and the director was an Australian, Simon Wincer.<ref>Persico Newhouse, Joyce J. \"'Perfect Hero' Selleck Takes Aim at Action\". ''[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]]''. 18 October 1990.</ref>\n\nWincer felt a good story had been ruined by numerous rewrites from people who knew little about Australian history, so he brought on Ian Jones as writer. They went back to the original draft, re-set it from the 1880s to the 1860s and made it more historically accurate.<ref name=\"wincer\">Scott Murray, \"Simon Wincer: Trusting His Instincts\", ''Cinema Papers'', November 1989 pp. 6\u201312, 78</ref>\n\n===Shooting===\nThe firearm used by Quigley (Selleck) is a custom 13.5 pound (6&nbsp;kg), single-shot, 1874 [[Sharps Rifle]], with a 34-inch (860&nbsp;mm) barrel.<ref>Sharp, Eric. \"Shooting Star \u2013 Antique Black-Powder Rifle Still Scene-Stealer\".

''[[Orlando Sentinel]]''. 6 August 1989.</ref> In 2002 Selleck donated the rifle, along with six other firearms from his other films, to the [[National Rifle Association]], as part of the NRA's exhibit \"Real Guns of Reel Heroes\" at the [[National Firearms Museum]] in [[Fairfax, Virginia]].<ref>\"Tom Selleck Donates Seven Guns To NRA National Firearms Museum\". [[National Rifle Association]]</ref>\n\nThe film was shot entirely in Australia. Scenes were filmed in and around [[Warrnambool]] and [[Apollo Bay, Victoria]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110220134727/http://www.film.greatsouthcoast.com.au/region/showcase.php?id=17 GreatSouthCoast website]</ref>\n\nAlthough several scenes of the story depict violence and cruelty toward and involving animals, a film spokesperson explained that no animal was harmed, and special effects were used. For example, Quigley and Cora are reduced to consuming \"grub worms\" (actually blobs of dough) for survival. A pack of dingoes attacks Cora, and she finally saves herself by shooting the animals. Those animals were specially trained, and were actually \"playing\" for that scene, which was later enhanced by visual and sound effects. Several scenes involve falling horses; they were performed by specially-trained animals and were not hurt. When a horse falls off a cliff, the \"horse\" was a mechanical creation. The film's producer stated that a veterinarian was on the set whenever animals were being used in filming.<ref>[http://www.ahafilm.info/movies/moviereviews.phtml?fid=6449 AHA Film website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722001511/http://www.ahafilm.info/movies/moviereviews.phtml?fid=6449 |date=22 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nCritical responses were mixed, with ''Quigley'' having a 58% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 19 reviews.<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|id=quigley_down_under}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] of ''The Chicago Sun-Times'' gave the film two-and-a-half out of four stars, writing it was a well-made but formulaic neo-western. He particularly praised the performances of Rickman and San Giacomo, saying \"[T]his may be the movie that proves her staying power.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/quigley-down-under-1990|work=Chicago Sun-Times|title=Quigley Down Under}}</ref>\n\nThe film, however, was not a financial success in theaters, roughly recouping its budget.\n\nThe film, and, more specifically, the protagonist's skill with his rifle, has led [[sniper]]s to refer to the act of killing two targets with a single bullet as \"a Quigley\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/8376808/Dead-Men-Risen-The-snipers-story.html#|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Toby|last=Harnden|title=Dead Men Risen: The snipers' story|date=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
