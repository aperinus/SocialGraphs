The plot follows two angels (Hunter and Lindo) who are sent to Earth to help make a disgruntled kidnapper (McGregor) and his hostage (Diaz) fall in love.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews and was [[Box office bomb|unsuccessful at the box office]], only grossing $14.6 million worldwide against its $12 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Heaven]], [[angel]]s are tasked with ensuring that mortals on Earth find love. The \"Captain\", [[Gabriel]], is upset at reviewing the file of angel partners O'Reilly and Jackson, all of whose recent cases have ended in divorce or misery. He introduces a radical new incentive: if their latest case isn't \"cracked\" \u2013 meaning, if the pair in question do not fall, and stay, in love, O'Reilly and Jackson must stay on earth forever, which does not appeal to them.\n\nCeline Naville is the spoiled twenty-something daughter of a wealthy businessman. When one of her suitors, a loathsome dentist named Elliott, proposes marriage to her, she offers to say yes, but only if he agrees to reenact \"[[William Tell]]\" with an apple on his head. As she takes aim with a pistol, Elliot's nerves fail.\n\nRobert Lewis is a [[janitor]] employed in the basement of Celine's father's company. His manager tells him he is to be replaced by a robot. As he drowns his sorrows at a local bar, his girlfriend, Lily tells him she is leaving him for an aerobics instructor.\n\nO'Reilly and Jackson pose as collection agents to repossess Robert's things and evict him from his apartment. Robert storms to the office of Mr Naville. Security guards run in and start to attack Robert but he holds them off. When Celine introduces herself, Robert decides to kidnap her. He drives her to a remote cabin in the California woods. Celine easily slips free but decides to stick around. She stays for the adventure and revenge against her father, suggesting that they extort a huge ransom.\n\nO'Reilly and Jackson pose as bounty hunters, and contract with Naville to retrieve Celine and kill Robert. Robert's first attempt to collect the ransom fails but Celine encourages him. They go out to a bar. When Robert wakes up the next morning, he is stunned to see that he and Celine have slept together.\n\nRobert makes a second demand for the ransom, with a letter written in Celine's blood. Naville gives O'Reilly and Jackson the money, and they go to meet Robert in the forest. To their disappointment, Robert appears willing to let Celine go in exchange for the money before O'Reilly stops his getaway.\n\nWhile O'Reilly and Celine wait by their car, Jackson takes Robert into the woods to execute him. Before he can, Celine decks O'Reilly, runs into the woods, and knocks Jackson out with a shovel. As Robert and Celine drive away, O'Reilly grabs the towbar and rides along. As she points her gun, Robert and Celine jump from the car, and it careens off a cliff, with the money still inside.\n\nSince they are short of money, Celine decides to rob a bank with Jackson's pistol. The robbery goes smoothly, until a security guard shoots at Celine. Robert pushes her out of the way, taking a bullet in the thigh. Celine hurriedly drives him back to the city, to be operated on by Elliot. A little later, when Robert regains consciousness, he is appalled to see Celine playing a sleazy sexual role-playing game with Elliott. A fight breaks out, and Robert knocks Elliot unconscious. As they drive away, Celine explains that she only agreed to Elliot's request so that he would help Robert. Hurt, Robert gets out of the car and walks away.\n\nTo get them back together, Jackson writes a love poem in Robert's handwriting and sends it to Celine. Overcome, she runs back to the bar, where Robert has started working as a janitor, and says he has won her heart with the poem. O'Reilly and Jackson, listening, dance for joy... until Robert says that he's never written a poem in his life. Humiliated, Celine runs out again. Robert runs after Celine, but is too late: O'Reilly and Jackson, believing they have failed, decide to make their Earth-bound lives bearable by kidnapping Celine for ransom.\n\nRobert tracks Celine to their hideout. He knocks O'Reilly down and, struggling with Jackson, tells Celine he loves her. The door is kicked down by Naville's butler, Mayhew, who shoots the two angels in the head. Leaving Celine locked in the trunk, Naville and Mayhew drive Robert and the two angels' bodies to the cabin, planning to fake a [[murder-suicide]].\n\nIn Heaven, Gabriel's secretary begs him to intervene, but he refuses. He phones God and asks him to do so. A neighbour releases Celine from the truck. Taking his gun, she runs to the cabin and confronts her father, while Mayhew holds Robert at gunpoint. Celine shoots Mayhew in the shoulder.\n\nGabriel frees O'Reilly and Jackson from a pair of body bags. After Gabriel congratulates them on a successful case, the two angels embrace as they prepare to return home. Robert and Celine retrieve the suitcase full of money and settle in their new castle in [[Scotland]].\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ewan McGregor]] as Robert Lewis\n*[[Cameron Diaz]] as Celine Naville\n*[[Holly Hunter]] as O'Reilly\n*[[Delroy Lindo]] as Jackson\n*[[Ian Holm]] as Naville\n*[[Dan Hedaya]] as [[Gabriel]]\n*[[Stanley Tucci]] as Elliot Zweikel\n*[[Maury Chaykin]] as Tod Johnson\n*[[Tony Shalhoub]] as Al\n*[[K.K.
