It follows a [[Italian Mafia|Mafia]] family in the [[witness protection program]] who want to change their lives. It is based on the French novel ''Malavita'' (''Badfellas'' in the 2010 English translation)<ref>{{cite book |author=Tonino Benacquista|title=Badfellas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DQqbQAAACAAJ|year=2010|publisher=Bitter Lemon Press |isbn=978-1-904738-43-5}}</ref> by [[Tonino Benacquista]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Mafia]] [[Boss (crime)|boss]] Giovanni Manzoni, who offended Don Lucchese, a rival mafia boss, survives an attempted hit on him and his family at a barbecue. He snitches on Lucchese, which sends him to prison. Manzoni and his immediate family enter an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[witness protection]] program under the supervision of Agent Robert Stansfield, and have been relocated various times, the latest being a small town in [[Normandy]].\n\nIn adjusting to life in the village, each family member runs into trouble. They are being watched by two FBI agents to ensure their safety. Giovanni claims to be an author writing a historical novel on the [[Normandy landings]], which is problematic as many citizens in the area are much more familiar with the event than he is. He finds ways to slip away to discover why the water in his house is brown. He beats a plumber who tries to unnecessarily change all the pipes in his house, and a local fertilizer factory owner who is responsible for the tainted water.\n\nDaughter Belle falls in love with Henri, a college student working as a substitute math teacher. She asks for private math lessons so she can spend time alone with him and seduce him. Giovanni's wife, Maggie, blows up a small grocery store when its owner spews [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] comments in French to the other customers and often visits the undercover FBI agents. She spends a lot of time at the church, where she and the local priest have an amicable relationship. However, their friendship ends when she [[Confession (religion)|confesses]] their crimes and he tells her never to come back.\n\nOn the first day of class at the local school, son Warren, is beaten up by a small group, but he creates a mini-mafia within the school. This allows him to beat up the original small group that first bullied him. He inadvertently alerts Don Luchese to their location when he quotes one of the kingpin's sayings in the school paper, which makes its way to Luchese by chance.\n\nGiovanni is asked to attend an American film event due to his supposed historical expertise and he brings Agent Stansfield along, claiming to want to bond with him. It it is in fact an alibi for a timed explosive rigged to destroy the fertilizer causing his brown water. The film screening takes an unexpected turn when instead of ''[[Some Came Running (film)|Some Came Running]]'', the scheduled film, they instead watch ''[[Goodfellas]]''. Throughout the film, Giovanni expresses a desire to talk about his life as a mobster. The debate after the film prompts him to tell his story to the audience. Feeling the cover has been compromised, Agent Stansfield gives the order to relocate the family again.\n\nMeanwhile, the school detects Warren's activities so he decides to leave town with a fake passport to establish his own mafia family in Paris, afraid that the FBI will drop the family's protection. At the train station, he sees seven hitmen arrive and head for town. He returns home to warn the family. Henri breaks up with Belle, which causes her to contemplate suicide, but she stops when she sees the hitmen enter the police station and kill several officers. Maggie returns home and finds her children gone, so she goes to ask the FBI surveillance team for help. Giovanni returns home and Maggie goes to speak with him, but sees the hitmen. She returns to the FBI safe house across the street.\n\nThe hitmen blow up the family's house and kill neighbors who leave their homes to investigate. Soon an intense gunfight ensues which involves all family members. Giovanni and Maggie strangle and stab a hitman after he raids the safe house and tries to sexually assault Maggie. Belle kills a hitman who went to look for weapons in his car's trunk. Using weapons she found in the trunk, she shoots one of the five hitmen near the burning house. Warren also gets guns from the car and shoots two of the hitmen while being given cover fire by Belle. One hitman is killed by the family dog. While chasing Belle, the lead hitman is killed by Stansfield's car.\n\nThe family relocates again. Despite numerous innocent townspeople having been slaughtered, Giovanni expresses his happiness at having had the chance to tell his story, saying that it brought the family closer.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Fred Blake / Giovanni Manzoni, the father.\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Maggie Blake / Maggie Manzoni, the mother.\n* [[Dianna Agron]] as Belle Blake / Belle Manzoni, the daughter.\n* [[John D'Leo]] as Warren Blake / Warren Manzoni, the son.\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Robert Stansfield, the FBI agent.\n* Jimmy Palumbo as Di Cicco, an FBI agent\n* [[Domenick Lombardozzi]]<ref name=\"Yahoo!\">{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/the-family-2013/ |title=The Family &#124; Trailer and Cast - Yahoo Movies |publisher=Movies.yahoo.com |access-date=17 November 2013}}</ref> as Caputo, an FBI agent\n* Stan Carp as Don Luchese, a mafia boss\n* [[Vincent Pastore]] as Willy \"Fat Willy\", a mafia Capo\n* [[Jonas Bloquet]] as Andr\u00e9\n* Jon Freda as Rocco\n* Michael J.
