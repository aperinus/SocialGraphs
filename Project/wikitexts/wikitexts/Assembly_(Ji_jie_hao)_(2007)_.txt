It starred [[Zhang Hanyu]], [[Deng Chao]], [[Yuan Wenkang]], Tang Yan, [[Wang Baoqiang]], [[Liao Fan]], [[Hu Jun]], Ren Quan and Li Naiwen. The film, ostensibly portraying an anti-war theme, was first released on 20 December 2007. It won the 2008 [[Hundred Flowers Awards]] and the 2009 [[Golden Rooster Awards]] for Best Film.\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn 1948, during the [[Huaihai Campaign]] of the [[Chinese Civil War]], Captain Gu Zidi leads the 9th Company of the 139th Regiment of the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) to capture a town controlled by the [[Republic of China Armed Forces]] (CNAF), then known as the [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA), during which they sustain heavy casualties from intense enemy firepower. Angered by the death of his [[political commissar]], Gu attempts to execute the CNAF soldiers who surrendered. As a result, he is thrown in jail for three days by his superior, Colonel Liu Zeshui. In jail, he befriends Wang Jincun, an enlisted man and former schoolteacher who has been jailed for cowardice. Upon being released, Gu and his 46 surviving men are sent to defend a coal mine on the bank of the Wen River, which is near [[Tai'an]], [[Shandong]]. They are ordered not to retreat until they hear a [[assembly (bugle call)|bugle call for assembly]]. With Liu's permission, Wang, being the most educated man in the company, becomes the 9th Company's new political commissar. Almost immediately after fortifying their position, the 9th Company comes under heavy attack by CNAF forces. Having fended off a wave of enemy infantry and supporting armour and subsequently destroying two enemy tanks, only a handful of PLA soldiers are still alive. At this point, some of the soldiers claim to hear the supposed bugle call in the distance. Gu, who was temporarily deafened by an explosion, is reluctant to believe them and commands that they fight to the death. The entire 9th Company is killed except Gu, who is knocked unconscious by an CNAF tank shell.\n\nPLA forces eventually recapture the area later and find Gu, unconscious and heavily wounded, while wearing an CNAF uniform he stole while trapped behind enemy lines. At a military hospital, Gu tries to explain that he was a captain in the PLA and that, after being knocked unconscious, he awoke, put on the enemy's uniform in order to steal food nearby, and then bombed an enemy fuel depot before falling unconscious again. However, the PLA went through a reorganisation while Gu was in a coma and hardly anyone remembers the existence of the 139th Regiment, whose members nearly all perished, so Gu is unable to confirm the verification of his identity. He is scorned by the other patients in the hospital who regarded him as a deserter. Later, when Communist China enters the [[Korean War]], Gu volunteers to fight there as an enlisted man in the [[People's Volunteer Army]] (PVA). During an artillery-spotting mission, in which the team disguised themselves as soldiers of the [[Republic of Korea Army]]'s [[6th Infantry Division (South Korea)|6th Infantry Division]], Gu risks his life to save his unit commander, Lieutenant Zhao Erdou, after the latter accidentally steps on an anti-personnel [[landmine]]. While Zhao proceeds with his assigned task, Gu, still holding down the landmine, manages to escape but loses his right eye in the ensuing blast. The two of them become close friends. Later, Zhao supports Gu's attempts to have his contributions and those of his former 9th Company recognised.\n\nGu returns to the Wen River battlefield and tries to locate the mine where the battle was fought. He is disappointed to see that the mine has been re-opened and in operation and that the old entrance has been buried underneath piles of coal. He also encounters Wang's widow and convinces her to marry Zhao. As time passes, Zhao manages to discover the location of the tomb of Colonel Liu Zeshui, the 139th Regiment's commander. Gu visits the tomb and finds that the curator is Liu's assistant and bodyguard, who survived the war but lost one of his arms. The curator confirms that the bugle call was never sounded because the 9th Company was deliberately sacrificed to buy time for the rest of the regiment before fighting the CNAF forces. Gu flies into a rage and fights with the curator but later manages to calm down.\n\nGu starts camping at the mine and attempts to dig out his men's bodies with a shovel, despite protests from the miners. After a month of digging, a living official from Gu's parent unit is found and verified the deeds of the 139th Regiment, specifically the 9th Company. The PLA sends an official notice to the local government to honour the 9th Company. However, Gu remains inconsolable because he cannot find the remaining bodies. At this point, he experiences a flashback which reveals that, as enemy forces closed in, he and Wang buried the bodies of the others deep inside the mine. While Gu went out to continue fighting, a mortally wounded Wang blew up the entrance to prevent the enemy from capturing the bodies, killing himself in the process.\n\nYears later, the remains of the other soldiers are found during an excavation for an irrigation project. The PLA erects a monument near the site and conducts a military funeral with full honours for the fallen men of the 9th Company. Gu finally finds peace. The ending titles say that Gu died in 1987 at the age of 71. He was abandoned by his parents when he was three months' old due to famine in his hometown and was subsequently found by a shoemaker in a millet field. He was named Gu Zidi, which literally means millet field.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Zhang Hanyu]] as Gu Zidi (\u8c37\u5b50\u5730), the commander of the 9th Company.\n* [[Deng Chao]] as Zhao Erdou (\u8d75\u4e8c\u6597), an artillery battalion commander who befriends Gu Zidi.\n* [[Yuan Wenkang]] as Wang Jincun (\u738b\u91d1\u5b58), the political commissar in the 9th Company.\n* Tang Yan as Sun Guiqin (\u5b59\u6842\u7434), Wang Jincun's widow who remarried Zhao Erdou.\n* [[Liao Fan]] as Jiao Dapeng (\u7126\u5927\u9e4f), the commander of the 1st Platoon in the 9th Company.\n* [[Wang Baoqiang]] as Jiang Maocai (\u59dc\u8302\u8d22), a sniper in the 9th Company.\n* [[Hu Jun]] as Liu Zeshui (\u5218\u6cfd\u6c34), the commander of the 139th Regiment.\n* Ren Quan as the original political commissar in the 9th Company who was killed at the beginning of the film.\n* Li Naiwen as L\u00fc Kuangou (\u5415\u5bbd\u6c9f), a soldier in the 9th Company.\n* Fu Heng as Luo Guangtian (\u7f57\u5e7f\u7530), a soldier in the 9th Company.\n* Zhao Shaokang as 'Old Hedgehog' Laociwei (\u8001\u523a\u732c), a soldier in the 9th Company.\n* Hu Ming as Xiaoliangzi (\u5c0f\u6881\u5b50), the bugler in the 139th Regiment.\n\n==Production==\nThe action and effects team from the 2004 Korean war film ''[[Taegukgi (film)|Taegukgi]]'' were employed to work on ''Assembly''. ''Assembly'' is also among the first films produced in mainland China to portray the [[Chinese Civil War]] in a realistic style. The film is also adapted from the novel ''Guan Si'' (''A Legal Case''), which is based on a real-life account of a veteran army captain upholding his company's honour.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film was a massive box office success, particularly in mainland China.\n\nPerry Lam gave a mixed review of ''Assembly'' in the Hong Kong magazine ''[[Muse (Hong Kong magazine)|Muse]]'': \"There is a huge discrepancy between the sophistication of the filmmakers in their knowledge and application of state-of-the-art techniques, and the naivety and bad faith they place in the value of unquestioning obedience to authority and sacrifice as the highest manifestation of patriotism.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lam|first=Perry|date=February 2008|title=The banality of romance and the lie of patriotism|journal=Muse Magazine|issue=13|pages=108}}</ref>\n\nKozo, who reviewed the film at the Hong Kong Asian Film Festival 2007, felt that ''Assembly'' is a safe commercial movie that does not offend anybody: \"In ''Assembly'', war is never really portrayed as a 'cause'. The human element is the main focus here, and the sacrifices made by soldiers are to be honoured because they're people, and not members of one side or the other.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lovehkfilm.com/panasia/assembly.htm|title = The Assembly (\u96c6\u7d50\u865f) (2007)}}</ref>\n\n==Sequel==\n''Assembly'' was quickly followed by a sequel, ''Assembly 2: The Cold Flame'' (\u96c6\u7ed3\u53f72-\u70fd\u706b), which was directed by Leon Yang (Yang Shupeng).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/entertainment/2008-02/26/content_6485093.htm|title = Zhang Hanyu back in uniform}}</ref> Although it also featured [[Zhang Hanyu]] in a leading role, it was actually shot in 2005 and held back by the studio.
