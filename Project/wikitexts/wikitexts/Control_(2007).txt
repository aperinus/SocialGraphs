It is the first feature film directed by [[Anton Corbijn]], who had worked with Joy Division as a photographer. The [[screenplay]] by [[Matt Greenhalgh]], was based on the biography ''[[Touching from a Distance]]'' by Curtis's widow Deborah, who served as a co-producer on the film. [[Tony Wilson]], who released Joy Division's records through his [[Factory Records]] label, also served as a co-producer. Curtis' bandmates [[Bernard Sumner]], [[Peter Hook]], and [[Stephen Morris (musician)|Stephen Morris]] provided incidental music for the soundtrack via their post-Joy Division incarnation [[New Order (band)|New Order]]. ''Control'' was filmed partly on location in [[Nottingham]], [[Manchester]], and [[Macclesfield]], including areas where Curtis lived, and was shot in colour and then printed to [[black-and-white]]. Its title comes from the Joy Division song \"[[She's Lost Control]]\", and alludes to the fact that much of the plot deals with the notion that Curtis tried to remain in control of his own life, and yet had no control over his [[epilepsy]] and pharmaceutical side effects.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =Orange\n  | first =Alan\n  | title = EXCLUSIVE: Anton Corbijn Is in 'Control'\n  | publisher = Movieweb\n  | date = 5 October 2007\n  | url = http://www.movieweb.com/exclusive-anton-corbijn-is-in-control\n  | access-date = 2007-10-05}}</ref>\n\n[[Sam Riley]] and [[Samantha Morton]] star as Ian and Deborah Curtis, and the film portrays the events of the couple's lives from 1973 to 1980, focusing on their marriage, the formation and career of Joy Division, Ian's struggle with [[epilepsy]], and his [[extramarital affair]] with Belgian journalist [[Annik Honor\u00e9]], culminating in his May 1980 suicide. [[Alexandra Maria Lara]] plays Honor\u00e9, while [[James Anthony Pearson]], [[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]], and [[Harry Treadaway]] play Sumner, Hook, and Morris, respectively. The film also features [[Toby Kebbell]] as band manager [[Rob Gretton]] and [[Craig Parkinson]] as Tony Wilson.\n\n''Control'' premiered at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] on 17 May 2007 where it won several awards including the [[Director's Fortnight]], the CICAE Art & Essai prize for best film, the Regards Jeunes Prize for best first/second directed feature film, and the Europa Cinemas Label prize for best European film in the sidebar.

Ian retreats from domestic life, preferring to write [[poetry]] in solitude. On 4 June 1976 they attend a [[Sex Pistols]] concert with [[Bernard Sumner]], [[Peter Hook]], and Terry Mason, who are starting a band. Mesmerized by the concert, Ian volunteers to be their singer. They name themselves Warsaw, and Terry moves into a managerial role with the addition of drummer [[Stephen Morris (musician)|Stephen Morris]]. The band debuts 19 May 1977 and soon rename themselves [[Joy Division]]. Ian and Debbie finance their first [[extended play|EP]], ''[[An Ideal for Living]]'' (1978).\n\nDuring his job as an [[employment agency|employment agent]], Ian witnesses his client Corinne Lewis suffering a [[seizure]]. Unsatisfied with the brief mention Joy Division receives from television host [[Tony Wilson]], Ian demands that he put the band on his programme. In April 1978 Joy Division plays a [[battle of bands]], impressing Tony and [[Rob Gretton]], who becomes their new manager. They perform \"[[Transmission (song)|Transmission]]\" on Tony's programme and sign to his [[Factory Records]] label; Tony signs the contract using his own blood.\n\nIn December 1978 Ian suffers a seizure on the way back from the band's first [[London]] gig. He is diagnosed with [[epilepsy]] and prescribed medications that leave him drowsy and moody. Learning that Corinne Lewis has died of a seizure, he pens \"[[She's Lost Control]]\" about her. He begins to neglect Debbie, who gives birth to their daughter Natalie in April 1979. Ian quits his job to go on tour, leaving Debbie to work and care for the baby.\n\nIan admits to [[Belgium|Belgian]] journalist [[Annik Honor\u00e9]] that he is miserable at home and considers his marriage a mistake. The two begin having an affair during Joy Division's January 1980 European tour. On returning home, Ian tells Debbie he is unsure if he still loves her. During the rehearsing of \"[[Love Will Tear Us Apart]]\", Rob informs the band that they will be departing 19 May for a tour of the United States. Debbie finds evidence of Ian's infidelity and confronts him. He promises that the affair is over, but continues to see Annik during the recording of ''[[Closer (Joy Division album)|Closer]]'' in [[Islington]].\n\nIan suffers a seizure mid-performance and is comforted by Annik, who admits she is falling in love with him. He attempts suicide by overdosing on [[phenobarbital]] but doctors save his life. He continues to perform, but is exhausted by the strain and overwhelmed by the audience's expectations. At a performance at the [[Derby Hall, Greater Manchester|Derby Hall]] the stress proves too much and he is only briefly able to go onstage. The audience riots when Alan Hempstall of [[Crispy Ambulance]] steps in to cover for Ian, and the gig is ruined. Ian tells Tony that he believes everyone hates him and that it is his own fault. When Debbie learns that Ian is still seeing Annik, she demands a [[divorce]]. Bernard attempts to use [[hypnotherapy]] on Ian, who then goes to stay with his parents. He writes to Annik admitting his fear that his epilepsy will eventually kill him, and confesses that he loves her.\n\nOn 17 May 1980, two nights before Joy Division is due to depart for America, Ian returns home and begs Debbie not to divorce him. When she refuses, he angrily orders her out of the house. After drinking alone and writing Debbie a letter, he has another seizure. Regaining consciousness the following morning, he [[hanging|hangs]] himself from the [[Sheila Maid]] in the kitchen. Debbie discovers his body and staggers into the street, crying for help. The news of Ian's death leaves the remaining Joy Division members stunned, while Tony consoles Annik. The group gather in a caf\u00e9 with [[Gillian Gilbert]], foreshadowing [[New Order (band)|the future of the band]]. Ian's body is [[cremation|cremated]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sam Riley]] as [[Ian Curtis]], the main figure in the film and the vocalist of Joy Division. Riley was relatively unknown before the film, and the director initially considered [[Cillian Murphy]] for the role, but later changed his mind because he viewed Murphy as \"a little shorter than Ian\".<ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Endelman\n  | first = Michael\n  | title = The Deal Report\n  | publisher = Entertainment Weekly\n  | date = 2006-02-24\n  | url =http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1160326,00.html\n  | access-date =2008-06-28 }}</ref>\n* [[Samantha Morton]] as Deborah Curtis, wife of Ian Curtis. Deborah marries Ian at a very young age but later in the film develops discord with her husband due to his affair with Annik.

After moving to England, he befriended the band and shot several pictures for ''[[NME]]'', which boosted his career as a photographer. Some of his pictures taken are featured in the film. He also directed the [[music video]] for the 1988 rerelease of \"Atmosphere\". He said that the film overlapped with his own life in some ways. \"I had moved to England to be close to that music at the time, and I was very into Joy Division. I worked with them, took pictures of them that became synonymous with their music, and I was forever linked. Then eight years after [Ian Curtis'] death, I did the video for \"Atmosphere.\" So in other people's eyes I was always connected with them.\"<ref>{{cite web | archive-date=2008-08-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804160744/http://drewtewksbury.com/2008/04/19/interview-anton-corbijn-on-control/ | url=http://drewtewksbury.com/2008/04/19/interview-anton-corbijn-on-control/ | title=Losing 'Control' | publisher=Drew Tewksbury: Multimedia Journalist. | date=2007-10-08 | access-date=2008-06-28 | last=Tewksbury | first=Drew | url-status=dead}}</ref>\n[[File:Barton St, Macclesfield, in imitation of Control grayscale.jpg|thumb|left|Barton Street in Macclesfield, 2014, shot in colour and processed in black and white as Corbijn did, similar to a scene in the film|alt=A black and white view of a street with parked cars and terraced brick houses on both sides gently sloping downhill, revealing a view of a hillside with a large brick industrial building on it]]\n''Control'' is Corbijn's debut as a film director, and he paid half of the \u20ac4.5 million budget out of his own pocket.<ref>{{cite AV media | title=Interview with Anton Corbijn about the film Control | publisher=Dutch TV | date=2006 | display-authors=etal | people=Anton Corbijn | medium=Television}}</ref><!-- at {{YouTube|dNqeEtnX8ic}} --> The film was shot on colour stock and printed to black and white to \"reflect the atmosphere of Joy Division and the mood of the era\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.joydiv.org/these.htm | title=Control: The Ian Curtis film | publisher=Joy Division Central | date=2007-02-02 | access-date=2007-02-12}}</ref> [[Todd Eckert]] and [[Orian Williams]] are the producers.
