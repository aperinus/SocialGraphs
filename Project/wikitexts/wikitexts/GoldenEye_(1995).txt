Directed by [[Martin Campbell]], it was the first in the series not to utilize any story elements from the works of novelist [[Ian Fleming]]. It was also the first ''James Bond'' film not produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]], following his stepping down from Eon Productions and replacement by his daughter, [[Barbara Broccoli]] (along with [[Michael G. Wilson]], although Albert was still involved as a consultant producer; it was his final film project before his death in 1996).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A817823 |title=The James Bond Films \u2013 1994\u20132002 |date=10 November 2002 |access-date=22 October 2007 |publisher=BBC News |archive-date=9 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109022744/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A817823 |url-status=live}}</ref> The story was conceived and written by [[Michael France]], with later collaboration by other writers. In the film, Bond fights to prevent a rogue ex-MI6 agent ([[Sean Bean]]) from using a satellite weapon against London to cause a global financial meltdown.\n\nThe film was released after a six-year hiatus in the series caused by legal disputes, during which [[Timothy Dalton]]\u2019s contract for the role of James Bond expired and he was replaced by Brosnan. [[M (James Bond)|M]] was also recast, with actress [[Judi Dench]] becoming the first woman to portray the character, replacing [[Robert Brown (British actor)|Robert Brown]]. The role of [[Miss Moneypenny]] was also recast, with [[Caroline Bliss]] being replaced by [[Samantha Bond]]; [[Desmond Llewelyn]] was the only actor to reprise his role, as [[Q (James Bond)|Q]]. It was the first Bond film made after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and the end of the [[Cold War]], which provided a background for the plot. [[Principal photography]] for ''GoldenEye'' took place in the UK, [[Russia]], [[Monte Carlo]] and [[Puerto Rico]]; it was the inaugural film production to be shot at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden|Leavesden Studios]]. The first Bond film to use [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), ''GoldenEye'' was also the final film of [[special effect]]s supervisor [[Derek Meddings]]'s career, and was dedicated to his memory.\n\nThe film accumulated a worldwide gross of over US$350&nbsp;million, considerably better than Dalton's films, without taking inflation into account.<ref name=\"nos\">{{cite web |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/JamesBond.php |title=Box Office History for James Bond Movies |access-date=18 October 2007 |work=The Numbers |publisher=Nash Information Service |archive-date=16 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316020739/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/JamesBond.php |url-status=live}}</ref> It received positive reviews, with critics viewing Brosnan as a definite improvement over his predecessor.<ref name=\"QNetwork\">{{cite web |title=GoldenEye |publisher=Qnetwork |url=http://www.qnetwork.com/review/348 |access-date=5 June 2022 |last=Kendrick |first=James}}</ref><ref name=\"variety\">{{cite news |title=GoldenEye |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |last=McCarthy |first=Todd |url=https://variety.com/1995/film/reviews/goldeneye-1200443796/ |date=15 November 1995 |access-date=5 June 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=GoldenEye |publisher=Filmcritic.com |url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/ddb5490109a79f598625623d0015f1e4/9503ab99be3b464086256275001adc5a?OpenDocument |access-date=27 April 2007 |last=Null |first=Christopher |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013021650/http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/ddb5490109a79f598625623d0015f1e4/9503ab99be3b464086256275001adc5a?OpenDocument |archive-date=13 October 2007}}</ref> It also received [[49th British Academy Film Awards#Winners and nominees|award nominations]] for \"[[BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects|Best Special Visual Effects]]\" and \"[[BAFTA Award for Best Sound|Best Sound]]\" from the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]].<ref name=\"bafta\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/film/nominations/?year=1995|title=Film Nominations 1995|publisher=[[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]]|access-date=5 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228220536/http://www.bafta.org/awards/film/nominations/?year=1995 <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archive-date=28 February 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn 1986, [[MI6]] agents [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]] and [[Alec Trevelyan]] infiltrate a Soviet chemical weapons facility in [[Arkhangelsk]]. While Trevelyan is caught and assumed killed by Colonel Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov, the facility's commanding officer, Bond destroys the site and flees.\n\nWhile undergoing an assessment nine years later, after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Bond attempts to prevent [[Xenia Onatopp]], a member of the Janus [[Organized crime|crime syndicate]], from stealing a [[Eurocopter Tiger]] attack helicopter during a military demonstration in [[Monte Carlo]], but is unable to prevent the theft. Returning to London, Bond oversees MI6 staff monitoring an incident in [[Severnaya Zemlya|Severnaya]], [[Siberia]], after the stolen helicopter turns up at a radar facility there. An [[electromagnetic pulse]] blast suddenly hits the site, destroying it and Russian fighter aircraft, while knocking out all satellite systems in orbit above.\n\nThe newly appointed [[M (James Bond)|M]] assigns Bond to investigate, after it is determined the blast came from a Soviet-era satellite armed with a [[nuclear electromagnetic pulse]] [[space-based weapon]], codenamed \"GoldenEye\". Although Janus is suspected of initiating the attack, Bond suspects Ourumov, now a general, was involved because the weapon system required high-level military access. Travelling to [[Saint Petersburg]], Bond is advised by his [[CIA]] contact Jack Wade to meet the former [[KGB]] agent turned gangster Valentin Zukovsky and have him arrange a meeting with Janus. Escorted to the meeting by Onatopp, Bond discovers that Janus is led by Trevelyan, who had faked his death at Arkhangelsk, and learns he is descended from the [[Repatriation of Cossacks after World War II#Lienz|Lienz Cossacks]] who were repatriated to the Soviet Union after collaborating with the [[Axis powers]] during World War II.\n\nLearning that Trevelyan seeks revenge against Britain for betraying his parents, Bond is sedated and trapped in the stolen Tiger alongside Natalya Simonova, a survivor of the Severnaya attack. After escaping the helicopter's destruction, the pair are interrogated by [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Russian Minister of Defence]] Dimitri Mishkin. The heated argument between the men leads Natalya to affirm Ourumov's involvement in the use of GoldenEye, and that fellow programmer Boris Grishenko survived along with her and is now working for Janus in operating a second GoldenEye satellite. Before Mishkin can act on the information, Ourumov kills him and captures Natalya. Commandeering a tank, Bond eventually pursues Ourumov to a missile train used by Janus. He kills Ourumov and escapes the train with Natalya before it explodes.\n\nBond and Natalya travel to [[Cuba]], after Boris is traced to a location within the island's jungles. While flying over the area, the pair are shot down. Onatopp attacks them after they crash land, but Bond kills her during the fight. The pair soon uncover a hidden base beneath a large lake, concealing a satellite dish, and proceed to infiltrate it. Bond is captured while trying to rig the base to explode, and learns from Trevelyan that he intends to use GoldenEye to devastate London to conceal the theft of financial records from the [[Bank of England]]. While Natalya is captured as well, she hacks into the satellite and reprograms it to initiate [[Atmospheric entry|atmospheric re-entry]] and thus destroy itself. When Boris loses his cool trying to undo her programming, Bond uses the moment to trigger a grenade, concealed in a pen, to allow him and Natalya to escape.\n\nTo prevent Boris from regaining control of the satellite, Bond sabotages the dish's antenna by jamming its gears. Trevelyan tries stopping him, and the ensuing fight between the two culminates in Trevelyan being dangled below the antenna. When Trevelyan asks Bond if he is killing him for England, Bond admits it is for himself before dropping Trevelyan to the ground. Natalya soon rescues Bond in a commandeered helicopter, moments before the antenna malfunctions and explodes, destroying the base and killing its personnel, with Trevelyan killed by falling debris and Boris killed by ruptured liquid nitrogen canisters. After landing somewhere safe, the pair prepare to enjoy some solitude together, but are interrupted by the arrival of Wade and a team of [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|U.S. Marines]], who escort them to [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo base]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]] (007), an MI6 officer assigned to stop the Janus crime syndicate from acquiring \"GoldenEye\", a clandestine satellite weapon designed and launched by the Soviets during the Cold War.\n* [[Sean Bean]] as [[Alec Trevelyan]] (006), initially another [[00 Agent|00 officer]] and Bond's friend, he fakes his death at Arkhangelsk and then establishes the Janus crime syndicate over the following nine years.\n* [[Izabella Scorupco]] as [[Natalya Simonova]], a programmer at the Severnaya lab.

Under the direction of John Parkinson and Gordon Arnell from the marketing department of MGM, many posters were produced for the film designed by Randi Braun and Earl Klasky with photographs taken by John Stoddart, Terry O'Neill, Keith Hamshere and George Withear. In the United States, an advance poster featured a gold-hued close-up on Bond's eyes pointing his Walther PPK handgun towards the viewer. The logo of the film was not displayed, only a tagline: \"There is no substitute\" and the 007 gun logo, in red. For the international market, a different advance poster was issued on which Pierce Brosnan appeared in black dinner jacket holding his silenced PPK gun, next to a 007 logo and under a different tagline: \"You know the name. You know the number\". This time, the film's logo was introduced, using the MatrixWide typeface (earlier versions of this logo used a modified FrizQuadrata typography). The theatrical artwork had two variations: both retained the same black background and action scenes collage surrounding the three principals (Pierce Brosnan, Izabella Scorupco and Famke Janssen), but the International poster had James Bond in tuxedo while in the US version only had the secret agent's face emerging from the shadows. The US variant was used for the cover artwork of the film's [[GoldenEye (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] and the box of the [[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|Nintendo 64 video game]] adaptation released in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|title=MARKETING|url=https://goldeneyedossier.wixsite.com/bond/marketing|access-date=2021-06-26|website=GoldenEye Dossier|archive-date=26 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210626205040/https://goldeneyedossier.wixsite.com/bond/marketing|url-status=live}}</ref> On a 2015 interview regarding his take on the ''GoldenEye'' poster campaign, photographer John Stoddart (who previously worked with Brosnan for a [[Brioni (brand)|Brioni]] photoshoot) said his only directive was \"Bond, girls and guns\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=John Stoddart Interview|url=https://goldeneyedossier.wixsite.com/bond/john-stoddart-interview|access-date=2021-06-26|website=GoldenEye Dossier|archive-date=26 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210626205039/https://goldeneyedossier.wixsite.com/bond/john-stoddart-interview|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1995, a teaser trailer for ''GoldenEye'' was attached to prints of [[Roger Donaldson]]'s film ''[[Species (film)|Species]]'' after its debut on the syndicated US television program ''Extra'',<ref name=\":0\"/> followed by a more generic theatrical trailer which revealed Bond's confrontation with agent 006.
