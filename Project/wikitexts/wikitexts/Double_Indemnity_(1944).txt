The screenplay was based on [[James M. Cain]]'s 1943 novel of the [[Double Indemnity (novel)|same title]], which appeared as an eight-part serial for ''[[Liberty (1924\u20131950)|Liberty]]'' magazine in February 1936.\n\nThe film stars [[Fred MacMurray]] as an insurance salesman, [[Barbara Stanwyck]] as a provocative housewife who is accused of killing her husband, and [[Edward G. Robinson]] as a claims adjuster whose job is to find phony claims. The term \"[[double indemnity]]\" refers to a clause in certain life insurance policies that doubles the payout in cases when the death is accidental.\n\nPraised by many critics when first released, the film was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]], but did not win any. Widely regarded as a classic, it often is cited as having set the standard for film noir. Deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the U.S. [[Library of Congress]] in 1992, ''Double Indemnity'' was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|first1=Andy|last1=Marx|first2=Dennis|last2=Wharton|date=1992-12-04|title=Diverse pix mix picked|url=https://variety.com/1992/film/news/diverse-pix-mix-picked-101808/|access-date=2020-06-08|website=Variety|language=en}}</ref> In 1998, it was ranked No. 38 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 best American films]] of all time, and in 2007 it placed 29th on their [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|10th Anniversary list]]. Wilder considered ''Double Indemnity'' his best film in terms of having the fewest scripting and shooting errors,<ref>\"One Head Is Better Than Two,\" in ''[[Films and Filming]]'' (London), February 1957.</ref> and always maintained that the two things he was proudest of in his career were the compliments he received from Cain about ''Double Indemnity'' and from [[Agatha Christie]] for [[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|his handling]] of her ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (play)|Witness for the Prosecution]]''.<ref name=hoo347/>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Double-Indemnity-LIFE-1944-2.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Walter and Phyllis]]\nIn 1938, insurance salesman Walter Neff returns to his office in downtown [[Los Angeles]] with a gunshot wound on his shoulder. He records a confession on a [[dictaphone]] for his friend and colleague, claims adjuster Barton Keyes. A [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] ensues.\n\nWalter meets the alluring [[Phyllis Dietrichson]] during a house call to remind her husband to renew his automobile insurance policy. They flirt, until Phyllis asks about buying an [[accident insurance]] policy for her husband - without his knowledge. Walter deduces Phyllis is contemplating murder and wanting no part of it,  he picks up his hat and quickly leaves. Later, Phyllis shows up at Walter's apartment and uses the excuse of the latter forgetting his hat to seduce him to murder her husband. The plan is to trick Dietrichson into signing what he thinks is a renewal. The policy has a [[double indemnity]] clause that pays double for an accidental death due to rare circumstances.\n\nLater, Phyllis drives her husband to the train station to attend his college reunion. Walter hides in the back seat, kills him and boards the train posing as Mr. Dietrichson. After the train gets underway, Walter goes to the outdoor platform at the back, ostensibly to smoke. He jumps off at a prearranged spot to meet Phyllis and drag Dietrichson's body onto the tracks.\n\nNorton, the company's president, believes the death was [[suicide]], but Keyes dismisses this theory. Soon, however, he begins to have doubts about the claim's legitimacy. Keyes tells Walter his theory while Phyllis hides behind the door: that she had an accomplice murder Dietrichson for the insurance money. However, he has no proof.\n\nThe victim's daughter, Lola, tells Walter she is convinced that her stepmother Phyllis is behind her father's death. Lola's mother also died under suspicious circumstances, and Phyllis was her nurse. Realizing Phyllis has killed before, Walter begins seeing Lola to keep her from going to the police with her suspicions, and later through guilt and to protect her from her stepmother. Walter fears Phyllis will murder Lola over her suspicions and because Dietrichson had changed his [[will and testament|will]] in Lola's favor, leaving Phyllis nothing.\n\nKeyes finds a witness who says the man on the train was younger than the dead man. Walter warns Phyllis that pursuing the insurance claim in court risks exposing the murder. He tries to convince her to lie low and let him try to convince Norton to pay out the claim.\n\nLola tells Walter she has discovered that her boyfriend, the hotheaded Nino Zachette, has been seeing Phyllis behind her back. Walter confronts Phyllis and tells her that he knows about her and Zachette. He guesses she is planning for Zachette to kill Lola and him, but tells her that he intends to kill her and frame Zachette. Phyllis shoots Walter in the shoulder, but finds herself unable to finish him off, realizing that she cares for someone else for the first time in her life. Walter does not believe Phyllis and kills her. He waits for Zachette and advises him not to enter the house. He convinces him to call Lola.\n\nWalter drives to the office and turns on the dictaphone, returning to the start of the film. Keyes arrives unnoticed and hears the truth. Walter tells him he is fleeing to Mexico, but collapses. Keyes lights a cigarette for Walter, while waiting for the police and an ambulance.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Double Indemnity, 1944 - trailer.ogv|thumb|1950s trailer for early television broadcasts of the film]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Fred MacMurray]] as Walter Neff\n* [[Barbara Stanwyck]] as [[Phyllis Dietrichson]]\n* [[Edward G.

Cain based his novella on a 1927 murder perpetrated by a married Queens, New York, woman and her lover whose trial he attended while working as a journalist in New York.<ref name=\"dvd2\">{{cite news | title = Shadows of Suspense | work = Double Indemnity Universal Legacy Series DVD | publisher = [[Universal Studios]] | year = 2006 }}</ref> In that crime, [[Ruth Snyder]] persuaded her boyfriend, Judd Gray, to kill her husband Albert after having him take out a big insurance policy \u2013 with a double-indemnity clause.{{efn|While the story certainly used the Snyder case as a framework, it lacked an important ingredient of the ''Double Indemnity'' structure: the \"inside-guy accomplice\" to the murder \u2013 the Walter Neff character. Cain later recalled this key innovation stemmed from a conversation he had years earlier with reporter [[Arthur Krock]] about Krock's days at the ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]''. An ad for ladies underwear was typeset to read: IF THESE SIZES ARE TOO BIG, TAKE A TUCK IN THEM. But when the paper hit the street, the T in tuck had been changed to an F. A furious Krock reset the ad for the next edition and demanded an explanation on how it happened. After two days of bullying the printer, the man finally confessed, \"...{{nbsp}}you do nothing your whole life but watch for something like that happening, so as to head it off, and then, Mr. Krock, you catch yourself watching for chances to ''do'' it.\" Cain also recalled another conversation he had with some insurance men in Los Angeles while verifying facts for ''Postman''. Said one: \"[People] think this stuff all comes from the police. That's wrong. All the big crime mysteries in this country are locked up in insurance company files, and the writer that gets wise to that ... is going to make himself rich.\" And thus was born Neff, who jumped the tracks after 15 years playing it straight in the insurance business. Armed now with a sense of his hero-gone-wrong, Cain began writing the story in 1934.<ref>Hoopes (1982), ''Cain''.</ref>}} The murderers were quickly identified, arrested and convicted. The front page [[Ruth Snyder#Trial|photo]] of Snyder's execution in the electric chair at [[Sing Sing Prison|Sing Sing]], captured by reporter Tom Howard using a hidden camera attached to his right ankle, has been called the most famous newsphoto of the 1920s.<ref>[[Bill Gallo|Gallo, Bill]] (2005). \"When 'Dem Bums' Were Kings,\" ''New York Daily News'', October 4, 2005.</ref>\n\n''Double Indemnity'' began making the rounds in Hollywood shortly after it was published in ''Liberty'' magazine in 1936. Cain had made a name for himself the year before with ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (novel)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'', a story of murder and passion between a migrant worker and the unhappy wife of a caf\u00e9 owner. Cain's agent sent copies of the novella to all the major studios and within days, [[MGM]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[20th Century-Fox]], and [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] were competing to buy the rights for $25,000. Then a letter went from [[Joseph Breen]] at the [[Hays Office]], and the studios withdrew their bids at once. In it, Breen warned:\n\n<blockquote>The general low tone and sordid flavor of this story makes it, in our judgment, thoroughly unacceptable for screen presentation before mixed audiences in the theater. I am sure you will agree that it is most important ... to avoid what the code calls \"the hardening of audiences,\" especially those who are young and impressionable, to the thought and fact of crime.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Lally | first1 = Kevin | title = Wilder Times: The Life of Billy Wilder | location = New York | publisher = [[Henry Holt and Company]] | year = 1996 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/wildertimeslifeo00lall/page/125 125\u201326] | isbn = 978-0-8050-3119-5 | url = https://archive.org/details/wildertimeslifeo00lall/page/125 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nEight years later, the novella was added to the collection of Cain's works titled ''Three of a Kind''. Paramount executive Joseph Sistrom thought the material was perfect for Wilder, and the studio bought the rights for $15,000.<ref>Lally, p. 126</ref> Paramount resubmitted the script to the Hays Office, but the response was identical to the one eight years earlier. Wilder, Paramount executive [[William Dozier]] and Sistrom decided to move forward anyway. They submitted a film treatment crafted by Wilder and his writing partner [[Charles Brackett]],<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Phillips | first1 = Gene D. |author-link=Gene D.

The property was regarded around Hollywood as unfilmable because of its iniquitous characters and the restrictions imposed by the [[Motion Picture Production Code]]. Although he had worked on the treatment, Charles Brackett decided it was too sordid and bowed out of the project, leaving Wilder to find another collaborator. His first choice, Cain was working for another studio and unavailable (although Cain claimed he never asked).<ref name=mcgmain>[[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|McGilligan, Patrick]] (1986). ''Backstory: Interviews with Screenwriters of Hollywood's Golden Age''. Los Angeles: University of California Press. {{ISBN|978-0-520-05689-3}}. p. 127</ref> Producer Joseph Sistrom, an avid reader and an admirer of ''[[The Big Sleep]]'', then suggested [[Raymond Chandler]].\n\nWilder later recalled with disappointment his first meeting with Chandler. Envisioning a former private detective who had worked his own experiences into gritty prose, he instead met a man he later described as looking like an accountant. Chandler was new to Hollywood, but saw it as a golden opportunity. Not realizing that he would be collaborating with Wilder, he demanded $1,000 and said he needed at least a week to complete the screenplay, to which Wilder and Sistrom simply looked at one another in amazement. To help guide him in writing a screenplay, Wilder gave Chandler a copy of his own screenplay for the 1941 ''[[Hold Back the Dawn]]'' to study. After the first weekend, Chandler presented 80 pages that Wilder characterized as \"useless camera instruction\";<ref name=lal128>Lally, p. 128</ref> Wilder quickly put it aside and informed Chandler that they would be working together, slowly and meticulously. By all accounts, the pair did not get along during their four months together. At one point Chandler even quit, submitting a long list of grievances to Paramount as to why he could no longer work with Wilder. Wilder, however, stuck it out, admiring Chandler's gift with words and knowing that his dialogue would translate very well to the screen.<ref name=\"dvd2\"/>\n\nChandler and Wilder made considerable changes to Cain's story. For one thing, the ending was overhauled. For another, the character of Barton Keyes was changed from a fairly clueless co-worker into an enemy mentor.\n\nInitially, Wilder and Chandler had intended to retain as much of Cain's original dialogue as possible. It was Chandler who first realized that the dialogue from the novella did not translate well to the screen. Wilder disagreed and was annoyed that Chandler was not putting more of it into the script. To settle it, Wilder hired a couple of contract players from the studio to read passages of Cain's original dialogue aloud. To Wilder's astonishment, Chandler was right, and in the end, the movie's cynical and provocative dialogue was more Chandler and Wilder than it was Cain.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Phillips | first1 = Gene D. | title = Creatures of Darkness: Raymond Chandler, Detective Fiction, and Film Noir | location = Lexington | publisher = [[University Press of Kentucky]] | year = 2000 | page = [https://archive.org/details/creaturesofdarkn00phil/page/170 170] | isbn = 978-0-8131-2174-1 | url = https://archive.org/details/creaturesofdarkn00phil/page/170 }}</ref> Chandler also did a lot of fieldwork while working on the script and took large volumes of notes. By visiting various locations that figured into the film, he brought a sense of realism about Los Angeles that seeped into the script. For example, he hung around Jerry's Market on Melrose Avenue in preparation for the scene during which Phyllis and Walter discreetly meet to plan the murder.<ref name=crea170>Phillips, ''Creatures'', p. 170</ref>\n\nThe tumultuous relationship between Wilder and Chandler only enhanced the product of their collaboration. Wilder, in fact, believed that discord, a tug-of-war, was a vital ingredient, necessary for a fruitful collaboration: \"If two people think alike,\" he once said, \"it's like two men pulling at one end of a rope. If you are going to collaborate, you need an opponent to bounce things off of.\"<ref name=some17>Phillips, ''Some Like'', p. 17.</ref> His tugging with Chandler did have a softer side, it seems: Over 60 years after the film's initial release, mystery writer and Chandler scholar [[Mark Coggins]] documented the fact that Chandler had agreed to appear in a cameo at 16 minutes into the film, glancing up from a magazine as Neff walks past outside Keyes' office. This is significant because, other than a snippet from a home movie, there is no other footage of Chandler known anywhere.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/05/raymond-chandler-double-indemnity-cameo | title = Chandler's double identity | last = Wooton | first = Adrian | date = June 5, 2009 | work = [[The Guardian]] | access-date=June 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\nWhen Chandler came to work with Wilder, he was a recovering alcoholic. Wilder said: \"He was in Alcoholics Anonymous, and I think he had a tough time with me \u2013 I drove him back into drinking.\"<ref name=lal129>Lally, p. 129</ref> By the time the picture was released, Chandler was disillusioned with the writers' lot in Hollywood; he published an angry piece titled \"Writers in Hollywood\" for ''The Atlantic Monthly'' in November 1945 in which he complained: \"The first picture I worked on was nominated for an Academy Award (if that means anything), but I was not even invited to the press review held right in the studio.\" He neglected, however, to mention that the studio had kept him on salary during the eight-week shooting schedule and that no changes to the script were allowed without his approval \u2013 a very rare accommodation for screenwriters, particularly newcomers, in those days.<ref name=crea181>Phillips, ''Creatures'', p. 181</ref> Offended, Wilder responded by saying: \"We didn't invite him? How could we? He was under the table drunk at Lucy's,\" a nearby watering hole for Paramount employees. This relationship with Chandler is what drew Wilder to his next film, ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'', about an alcoholic writer. Wilder made the film, in part, \"to explain Chandler to himself.\"<ref name=\"dvd2\"/>\n\nCain was impressed with the way his book turned out on the screen. After seeing the picture half a dozen times, he was quoted as saying \"It's the only picture I ever saw made from my books that had things in it I wish I had thought of. Wilder's ending was much better than my ending, and his device for letting the guy tell the story by taking out the office dictating machine \u2013 I would have done it if I had thought of it.\"<ref name=mcg125>McGilligan, p. 125</ref>\n\nWilder's and Brackett's estrangement during ''Double Indemnity'' was not a permanent one. Years later, Wilder characterized their time apart as just another kind of adultery: \"1944 was 'The Year of Infidelities,{{' \"}} he said. \"Charlie produced ''[[The Uninvited (1944 film)|The Uninvited]]'' ... I wrote ''Double Indemnity'' with Raymond Chandler ... I don't think he ever forgave me. He always thought I cheated on him with Raymond Chandler.\" Brackett spun the breakup in a decidedly different light, saying \"Billy got so despondent at being without me that we did ''The Lost Weekend'', a depressing film about a writer who has trouble writing.\"<ref>Sikov, pp. 197\u2013213</ref> ''The Lost Weekend'' was a distinguished offspring for the reconciled partnership \u2013 they left [[18th Academy Awards|Oscar night]] with three Awards: Best Picture for producer Brackett, Best Director for Wilder, and a shared pair of statuettes for both for Best Screenplay. They worked together through ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' in 1950, then split for good.\n\nWilder and Chandler's ''Double Indemnity'' screenplay was included in [[Library of America]]'s second volume of Chandler's work, ''Later Novels and Other Writings'' (1995). This volume also includes the aforementioned \"Writers in Hollywood\" piece by Chandler.\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Double indemnity screenshot 3.jpg|thumb|Wilder chose a bad wig for Stanwyck to underscore Phyllis's \"sleazy phoniness\".]]\nHaving the two protagonists mortally wound each other was one of the key factors in gaining Hays Office approval for the script: the [[Production Code]] demanded that criminals pay, on screen, for their transgressions. In addition, ''Double Indemnity'' broke new cinematic ground on several fronts, one of these being the first time a Hollywood film explicitly explored the means, motives, and opportunity of committing a murder.<ref>[[Eddie Muller|Muller, Eddie]] (1998). ''Dark City: The Lost World of Film Noir''. New York: St. Martin's Press. {{ISBN|978-0-312-18076-8}}. p. 56</ref> It took skillful performers to bring nuance to these treacherous characters, and casting the roles of Walter Neff and Phyllis Dietrichson was a challenge for Wilder.\n\nSistrom's and Wilder's first choice for the role of Phyllis Dietrichson was Barbara Stanwyck. At the time, Stanwyck was the highest-paid actress in Hollywood and the highest-paid woman in America.<ref name=dvd2/> (Her eventual co-star MacMurray matched Stanwyck's prominence at the pay window: in 1943, he was the highest-paid actor in Hollywood, and the fourth highest-paid American.)<ref>Flint, Peter B. \"Fred MacMurray Is Dead at 83; Versatile Film and Television Star.\" ''The New York Times'', November 6, 1991. MacMurray made $420,000 in 1943.</ref> Given the nature of the role, Stanwyck was reluctant to take the part, fearing it would have an adverse effect on her career. According to Stanwyck:\n<blockquote>I said \"I love the script and I love you, but I am a little afraid after all these years of playing heroines to go into an out-and-out killer.\" And Mr. Wilder \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 looked at me and he said \"Well, are you a mouse or an actress?\" And I said \"Well, I hope I'm an actress.\" He said \"Then do the part\". And I did and I'm very grateful to him.<ref name=lal135>Lally, p. 135</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe character of Walter Neff was not only a heel, he was a weak and malleable heel \u2013 many Hollywood actors, including [[Alan Ladd]], [[James Cagney]], [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Fredric March]] passed on it.<ref name=lal134>Lally, p. 134</ref> Wilder recalls \"scraping the bottom of the barrel\" and approaching [[George Raft]]. Raft was illiterate, so Wilder had to tell him the plot. About halfway through, Raft interrupted him with \"Let's get to the lapel bit.\" \"What lapel bit?\" a bewildered Wilder replied. \"The lapel,\" the actor said, annoyed by such stupidity. \"You know, when the guy flashes his lapel, you see his badge, you know he's a detective.\" This was his vision of the film, and because it wasn't part of the story, Raft turned the part down.<ref name=zolmain>[[Maurice Zolotow|Zolotow, Maurice]] (1977).

MacMurray felt safe about his acquiescence because Paramount, which had him under contract and had carefully crafted his good guy image, would never let him play a \"wrong\" role.<ref name=sik202>Sikov, p. 202</ref> His trust, however, was misplaced: His contract was up for renewal at the time, and because his friend and co-star [[Carole Lombard]] had shrewdly and successfully taught him how to play hardball with the studio bosses, he was not the pliable pushover of old. Paramount executives decided to let him play the unsavory role to teach him a lesson. A lesson was indeed taught, but not the one Paramount had in mind.<ref name=sik203>Sikov, p. 203</ref> MacMurray made a great heel and his performance demonstrated new breadths of his acting talent. \"I never dreamed it would be the best picture I ever made,\" he said.<ref name=zol118>Zolotow, p. 118</ref>\n\nEdward G. Robinson was reluctant to sign on for the role of Barton Keyes, but not for the same reasons as MacMurray and Stanwyck. Having been a star since ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' in 1930, this role represented a step downward to the third lead. Robinson later admitted \"At my age, it was time to begin thinking of character roles, to slide into middle and old age with the same grace as that marvelous actor [[Lewis Stone]]\". It also helped, as he freely admitted, that he drew the same salary as the two leads for fewer shooting days.<ref name=lal135/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Double indemnity screenshot 1.jpg|left|thumb|Neff confesses into a [[Dictaphone]].]]\nThe original ending to the Cain novella called for the characters to commit double suicide. Suicide, however, was strictly forbidden at the time by the [[Production Code Administration|Production Code]] as a way to resolve a plot, so Wilder wrote and filmed a different ending in which Neff goes to the gas chamber while Keyes watches. This scene was shot before the scenes that eventually became the film's familiar ending, and once that final intimate exchange between Neff and Keyes revealed its power to Wilder, he began to wonder if the gas chamber ending was needed at all. \"You couldn't have a more meaningful scene between two men\", Wilder said.<ref name=lal137>Lally, p. 137</ref> He later recounted: \"The story was between the two guys.

Seitz]]. At the time, Seitz was the premier director of photography on the Paramount lot; his work extended back to the silent era. Wilder had worked with Seitz on his previous film, ''[[Five Graves to Cairo]]'', for which Seitz was nominated for an Academy Award, and Wilder praised Seitz's willingness to experiment and fail.<ref name=lal124>Lally, p. 124</ref> Here Wilder taps into his 1920s Berlin roots, and he and Seitz give the film a look subtly reminiscent of [[German expressionism]], with dramatic deployment of light and shadows.<ref name=lal136>Lally, p. 136</ref> \"He was ready for anything\", Wilder said. \"Sometimes the [[Dailies|rushes]] were so dark that you couldn't see anything.

Once the set was ready for filming, Wilder went around and overturned a few ashtrays to give the house an appropriately grubby look. Wilder and Seitz also blew aluminum particles into the air so that, as they floated down, they looked just like dust.<ref name=some63>Phillips, ''Some Like'', p. 63</ref>\n\n[[File:Indemnity Bar Lighting.jpg|thumb|Use of \"venetian blind\" lighting became a stock-in-trade film noir look.]]Another technique Seitz used was \"[[venetian blind]]\" lighting which almost gives the illusion of prison bars trapping the characters. Barbara Stanwyck later reflected: \"for an actress, let me tell you the way those sets were lit, the house, Walter's apartment, those dark shadows, those slices of harsh light at strange angles \u2013 all that helped my performance. The way Billy staged it and John Seitz lit it, it was all one sensational mood.\"<ref name=mull58>Muller, p. 58</ref>\n\nFor Neff's office at Pacific All Risk, Wilder and set designer [[Hal Pereira]] conspired to create a little in-house joke, typical of Billy Wilder. In the opening scenes, as Walter Neff stumbles off the elevator on his way to his office to record his confession, the vast two-tiered office is empty and dark. With the camera following him, Neff lurches towards the balcony railing overlooking rows and rows of uniform corporate desks. Neff turns left, but the camera continues forward until it reaches the brink and stares down for an anxious moment into a colorless American business purgatory. Here, Pereira is said to have copied an existing office: the corporate headquarters of Paramount Pictures in New York City.<ref name=sik207>Sikov, p. 207</ref>{{efn|Sixteen years later, Wilder scored notability again with the design of an insurance company office: in 1960's ''[[The Apartment]]'', he and art director [[Alexandre Trauner]] constructed a huge office made even more intimidating by bending \"parallel\" lines inward and using progressively smaller and smaller desks \u2013 and smaller and smaller extras to populate them \u2013 farther back from the camera, to make the cavernous, harshly-lit space seem even more vast.<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20010722/REVIEWS08/107220301/1023 Ebert, Roger].

The crew was breaking for lunch before striking the set. In the script, the pair get in their car and simply drive away. But as Wilder got into his own car to leave, it wouldn't start. Inspired, he ran back and ordered the crew back. Wilder reshot the scene, only this time as Phyllis starts the car, the motor stalls and won't turn over. She tries several more times, but the car won't start and the two look at each other in growing panic. Walter desperately reaches over, turns the key and guns the motor, finally starting the car. Only then do they speed away from the crime scene. The result was one of the more suspenseful scenes in the film, but was not in the original script.<ref name=crea1756>Phillips, ''Creatures'', pp. 175-76</ref> MacMurray was surprised when he first saw it onscreen: \"When I&nbsp; ... turned the key I remember I was doing it fast and Billy kept saying 'Make it longer, make it longer,' and finally I yelled 'For Chrissake Billy, it's not going to hold that long,' and he said 'Make it longer,' and he was right.\"<ref name=zol116>Zolotow, p. 116</ref>\n\nWilder managed to bring the whole production in under budget at $927,262 despite $370,000 in salaries for just four people ($100,000 each for MacMurray, Stanwyck, and Robinson, and $70,000 \u2013 $44,000 for writing and $26,000 for directing \u2013 for himself).<ref name=sik211>Sikov, p. 211</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{Listen\n |filename     = The_Conspiracy.ogg\n |title        = The Conspiracy\n |description  = The nervous running figure for [[tremolo]] strings sets off each of Neff's flashbacks to represent the conspirator's activities.\n}}\nThe score to ''Double Indemnity'' was composed by [[Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa]], whose work on Wilder's previous film ''Five Graves to Cairo'' had been his first real Hollywood engagement for a major studio. Wilder had praised that work and promised to use R\u00f3zsa on his next film. Wilder had the idea of using a restless string tremolo (as in the opening to [[Franz Schubert]]'s [[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|Unfinished Symphony]]) to reflect the conspiratorial activities of Walter and Phyllis against her husband which R\u00f3zsa felt was a good one (and the symphony is actually used with a very melodramatic effect in the scene with Lola and Walter in the hill above Hollywood Bowl, 1:23\u20131:26). As work progressed, Wilder's enthusiasm about R\u00f3zsa's score only grew, but the studio's Musical Director [[Louis Lipstone]] was of a different mind; he and Wilder previously clashed over some post-production cuts he had made to the ''Five Graves'' score which created problems with the music's continuity and logic. Now the two were coming to loggerheads again.<ref name=sik2101>Sikov, pp. 210\u201311</ref><ref name=rozmain>[[Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa|R\u00f3zsa, Mikl\u00f3s]] (1982).

Okay?\" Lipstone then disappeared and was not seen at the sessions again. He later summoned R\u00f3zsa to his office and reprimanded him for writing \"Carnegie Hall music\" which had no place in a film. R\u00f3zsa took this as a compliment, but Lipstone assured him it was not \u2013 and suggested he listen to the music from ''[[Madame Curie (film)|Madame Curie]]'' to learn how to write a proper film score. When R\u00f3zsa pointed out that ''Double Indemnity'' was a love story, Lipstone suggested his music was more appropriate to ''[[The Battle of Russia]]''.<ref name=sik2101/><ref name=roz121>R\u00f3zsa, p. 121</ref> Lipstone was convinced that as soon as the studio's Artistic Director [[Buddy DeSylva]] heard the music he would throw it out. At a screening soon after, DeSylva called him over; expecting heads to roll, Lipstone eagerly huddled with his chief \u2013 only to have DeSylva praise the music, saying it was exactly the dissonant, hard-hitting score the film needed. The boss's only criticism: There was not enough of it. By this time, Lipstone had an arm around DeSylva, asking unctuously \"I always find you the right guy for the job, Buddy, don't I?\"<ref name=roz122>R\u00f3zsa, pp. 122</ref>\n\nThe score was nominated for an Academy Award, and the success brought R\u00f3zsa offers to do as many films as he had time for.<ref name=roz122/>\n\n===Locations===\n[[File:GlendaleStationStreetside.jpg|right|thumb|Southern Pacific Depot, Glendale, now carefully preserved, was not used in the film.

[[David O. Selznick]], no stranger to self-aggrandizement, frequently sought to put a high-culture gloss on his pictures with \"trade-book\" ads. At just the time ''Double Indemnity'' was released, Selznick's ''[[Since You Went Away]]'' was enjoying some box-office success. In his ads, Selznick quoted various dignitaries claiming it was the finest picture they had ever seen, how it served such a noble purpose, how it elevated humanity to new levels \u2013 no high-toned platitude was too lofty to invoke.

While some reviewers found the story implausible and disturbing, others praised it as an original thriller. In his mixed review of the film in ''The New York Times'', film critic [[Bosley Crowther]] called the picture \"Steadily diverting, despite its monotonous pace and length.\" He complained that the two lead characters \"lack the attractiveness to render their fate of emotional consequence\", but also felt the movie possessed a \"realism reminiscent of the bite of past French films\".<ref name=lal139>Lally, p. 139</ref>\n\nHoward Barnes at the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' was much more enthusiastic, calling ''Double Indemnity'' \"one of the most vital and arresting films of the year\", and praising Wilder's \"magnificent direction and a whale of a script\".

According to [[Robert Sklar]], a former chairperson of the Department of Cinema Studies at [[New York University Tisch School of the Arts]], classic film noir is marked by major thematic elements: a plot about a crime told from the point of view of the criminal; exploration of psychosexual themes; and a visually \"dark and claustrophobic framing, with key lighting from sources within the [[mise-en-sc\u00e8ne]] casting strong shadows that both conceal and project characters' feelings\".<ref>Sklar, Robert. ''Film: An International History of the Medium''.  London: Thames and Hudson, 1990.  p. 305</ref>\n\n''Double Indemnity'' has been compared with Wilder's other acclaimed film noir: ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950). The narrative structure in both films begins and ends in the present, but the bulk of the plot is told in flashback narrated by their protagonists. Sklar explains, \"[T]he unusual juxtaposition of temporalities gives the spectator a premonition of what will occur/has occurred in the flashback story.&nbsp; ... Besides ''Double Indemnity'' and ''[[Detour (1945 film)|Detour]]'', voice-over is a key aspect of ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'', ''[[Gilda]]'', ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'', and ''[[Out of the Past]]''&nbsp; ... as well as many others.\"<ref>Sklar, p. 309</ref> Critic and writer [[Wendy Lesser]] notes that the narrator of ''Sunset Boulevard'' is dead before he begins narrating, but in ''Double Indemnity'', \"the voice-over has a different meaning. It is not the voice of a dead man&nbsp; ... it is&nbsp; ... the voice of an already doomed man.\"<ref>Lesser, Wendy.

Both ''Postman'' and ''Double Indemnity'' were remade: ''Double Indemnity'' as a television movie in [[Double Indemnity (1973 film)|1973]] starring [[Richard Crenna]] (who also starred in ''Body Heat''), [[Lee J.

An Indian film, ''[[Jism (2003 film)|Jism]]'' (2003), was inspired by the film.\n\n''Double Indemnity'' is one of the films parodied in the 1993 film ''[[Fatal Instinct]]''; the hero's wife conspires to have him shot on a moving train and fall into a lake so that she can collect on his insurance, which has a \"triple indemnity\" rider. [[Carol Burnett]] parodied the film as \"Double Calamity\" on her TV show.\n\n==Imitators==\nAfter the success of ''Double Indemnity'', imitators of the film's plot were rampant.

Released as ''[[Apology for Murder]]'', Paramount was not fooled by the title change and quickly obtained an injunction against the film's release that still remains in effect.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dixon|first=Wheeler|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arM1DgAAQBAJ&q=sam+newfield+single+indemnity&pg=PA67|title=Cinema at the Margins|date=2013|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-1-78308-025-0|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSo many imitations flooded the market that Cain believed he deserved credit and remuneration. Instead he led a movement within the [[Writers Guild of America, West|Screen Writers Guild]] to create the American Author's Authority, a union that owned its members' works, negotiated better subsidiary deals, and protected against copyright infringement on behalf of its members. This was, however, during the depth of the [[McCarthyism|Red Scare]] in Hollywood and Guild members rejected the socialist notion.<ref name=mull59>Muller, p. 59</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1944]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n*[https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-film-preservation-board/documents/double_indemnity.pdf''Double Indemnity''] essay by [[Matt Zoller Seitz]] at [[National Film Registry]]\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=deq3xI8OmCkC&source=gbs_similarbooks ''Double Indemnity''] essay by Daniel Eagan in America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry, A&C Black, 2010 {{ISBN|0826429777}}, pages 371-372\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/7814-the-black-heart-of-double-indemnity The Black Heart of Double Indemnity] an essay by [[Angelica Jade Basti\u00e9n]] at [[The Criterion Collection]]\n*{{AFI film|2201}}\n* {{IMDb title|0036775}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{Tcmdb title|73500}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|double_indemnity}}\n* [http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Double-Indemnity.html ''Double Indemnity''] film script at the Internet Movie Script Database\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120225233637/http://cinemademerde.com/Essay-Double_Indemnity_Complete_File.shtml ''Double Indemnity: The Complete File''] story analysis\n* [http://dearoldhollywood.blogspot.ch/2009/05/double-indemnity-film-locations.html Film locations now and then]\n\n; Streaming audio\n* [https://archive.org/download/ScreenGuildTheater/Sgt_45-03-05_ep235_Double_Indemnity.mp3 ''Double Indemnity''] on [[Screen Guild Theater]]: March 5, 1945\n* [http://www.doctormacro.com/Radio%20Shows/Lux%20Radio%20Theater/LUX%20-%201950-10-30%20(Double%20Indemnity).mp3 ''Double Indemnity''] on [[Lux Radio Theater]]: October 30, 1950\n\n{{Billy Wilder}}\n{{Raymond Chandler}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Double Indemnity}}\n[[Category:1940s crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:1944 films]]\n[[Category:Adultery in films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:1940s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Film noir]]\n[[Category:Films about capital punishment]]\n[[Category:Films about murder]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by James M.
