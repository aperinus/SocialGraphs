It chronicles the relationship between [[Mark Bittner]], an unemployed musician who lives rent-free in a cabin in the [[Telegraph Hill, San Francisco|Telegraph Hill]]-neighborhood of [[San Francisco]], and a flock of [[feral parrots]] that he feeds and looks after. Bittner also wrote a [[memoir]] about his experiences with the parrots, which shares the title of the documentary, but has the added subtitle: A Love Story...with Wings.<ref name=WPTH1/>\n\nIn May 2007, the documentary aired on the [[PBS]] series ''[[Independent Lens]]''.\n\n==Summary==\nMuch of the film focuses on the parrots and their individual personalities and relationships with one another and Bittner. The flock is composed primarily of [[Red-masked Parakeet|cherry-headed conures]], but there is one lonely [[Blue-crowned Parakeet|blue-crowned conure]]. Some San Francisco residents share the different stories they have heard about the possible origins of the flock.\n\nBittner tells his story as well. He had come down to San Francisco from [[Seattle]] to be a musician, but, after giving up on that dream, found himself directionless. Although he would occasionally do odd jobs, he mostly was more or less unemployed and homeless for many years, until he found some stability, thanks to a free place to stay, and purpose (and even minor celebrity), thanks to the relationship he developed with the parrots.\n\nThe later part of the film depicts Bittner's preparations to vacate his residence, which is about to undergo extensive renovations. He speaks to the city council about the parrots and finds a place to send the few birds that are unable to live with the flock, and so had been living with him. At the end, it is revealed that filmmaker, Judy Irving, and subject, Mark Bittner, began a relationship over the course of making the film.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAs is explained in the special features included on the [[DVD]] release of the film, about a year after Bittner left Telegraph Hill, he and Irving moved back, to a house near his old one, and he reestablished his connection with the flock of parrots, which had grown some. Bittner and Irving were later married. In 2007 the city of San Francisco instituted a ban on feeding the flock.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-Supes-OK-ban-on-feeding-parrots-2588772.php|title = SAN FRANCISCO / Supes OK ban on feeding parrots / 10-1 vote comes despite opposition of birds' neighbors|date = 6 June 2007}}</ref> The ban was supported by Bittner.\n\n==Production==\nRaising funding for the film was difficult at first, as Irving had to find individual donors, but the proceeds from a fundraiser at which Bittner gave a presentation to a packed theater allowed her to start shooting the film in earnest.<ref name=WPTH1>{{cite book |title=The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill |last=Bittner |first=Mark |year=2004 |publisher=Three Rivers Press |location=New York |isbn=0-609-61055-4 |pages=241\u2013244 }}</ref>\n\nThe musical score for the film was the final project by [[Chris Michie]], a Bay area musician who was formerly the guitarist for [[Van Morrison]], before his death from [[melanoma]]. The film, which Michie did not live to see released, is dedicated to him.\n\nBittner noted that there is humor in the piece, which he believes makes it different from many other [[Nature documentary|nature documentaries]].<ref name=Fraser>{{cite web |url=http://www.close-upfilm.com/features/Interviews/markbittner.htm |title=An interview with Mark Bittner, subject of 'The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill' |accessdate=2008-12-09 |last=Fraser |first=Peter |publisher=close-upfilm.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128104713/http://www.close-upfilm.com/features/Interviews/markbittner.htm |archivedate=2007-11-28 }}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nThe film won the [[Genesis Award]] for Documentary Film and was nominated for the 2005 [[Satellite Awards|Satellite Award]] for Outstanding Documentary DVD.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Portal|San Francisco Bay Area}}\n* [https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/wildparrots/ The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill] site for [[Independent Lens]] on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]\n* {{IMDb title|0424565|The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill}}\n* {{AllRovi movie|307952|The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill}}\n* {{rotten Tomatoes|wild_parrots_of_telegraph_hill|The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wild Parrots Of Telegraph Hill}}\n[[Category:2003 films]]\n[[Category:2003 documentary films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about birds]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about urban animals]]\n[[Category:Parrots]]\n[[Category:Feral parrots]]\n[[Category:Environment of the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Films shot in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Films set in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]"}]}}}}
