Directed by [[John Mackenzie (film director)|John Mackenzie]], it is based on the 1984 novel ''[[The Fourth Protocol]]'' by [[Frederick Forsyth]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1968, an [[Eastern Bloc|East]]-[[Western Bloc|West]] agreement is established to halt [[nuclear proliferation]]. One of its clauses, the Fourth Protocol, forbids the non-conventional delivery of a nuclear weapon to a target.\n\n[[MI5]] officer John Preston breaks into the residence of British government official George Berenson on New Year's Eve and finds a number of top secret [[NATO]] files that should not have been there. He reports his findings to high-ranking [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Secret Service]] official Sir Nigel Irvine, who deals with the leak. Preston's unauthorised method of retrieving the documents embarrasses the acting Director of MI5, Brian Harcourt-Smith, and as punishment for his insubordination, Preston is relegated to lowly \"Airports and Ports\".\n\n[[KGB]] officer Major Valeri Petrofsky is sent on a mission to the United Kingdom by General Govorshin, the head of the [[KGB]]. Govorshin's subordinate, Pavel Borisov, complains to his old friend General Yevgeny Karpov, about his department being stripped of resources and personnel, particularly his star officer Petrofsky. A surprised Karpov quietly investigates and learns about Petrofsky's unsanctioned mission \u2013 to violate the Fourth Protocol by assembling and detonating an atomic device as a [[false flag]], to appear to be an American [[Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents|nuclear accident]] at a nearby military base, intended to strain [[Special Relationship|British-US relations]] and strengthen the [[anti-nuclear movement]] in advance of an election in favour of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn [[Glasgow]], a Soviet sailor is struck by a truck while fleeing from a port guard. Among the dead man's possessions, Preston finds a disk of [[polonium]], which could only be useful as a component of a detonator for a bomb. He informs Harcourt-Smith, but is promptly suspended, as Harcourt-Smith believes that Preston is manufacturing a fake incident to work his way back into MI5. Preston, however has the confidence of Sir Bernard Hemmings, the gravely-ill Director of MI5, as well as Irvine, who is happy to sidestep Harcourt-Smith's directives. Preston sets to work and eventually comes across Winkler, a known [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] KGB agent, and tails him from the airport.\n\nMeanwhile, Petrofsky meets KGB agent Irina Vassilievna, a bomb expert who is pretending to be his wife. Under her guidance, they assemble the device from the smuggled items and she sets it on a two-hour delay as they agreed on. Unbeknownst to Petrofsky, Vassilievna follows her own orders, resetting the delay to zero. After sleeping with Petrofsky, she finds his own secret order to eliminate her and tries to warn him about the double-cross, but he kills her before she can.\n\nAfterwards, Petrofsky is observed contacting Winkler. Preston tracks him to Ipswich, loses him, then finds him again. Preston eventually realises that Petrofsky's target is RAF Baywaters, and locates Petrofsky's house, which lies right next to the base.\n\nWhen Petrofsky starts to activate the bomb, on an impulse, he checks the timer first and realises he has been betrayed. At that moment, an [[Special Air Service|SAS]] team storms the house and during a struggle, Preston subdues and disables Petrofsky. To Preston's outrage, one of the SAS team cold-bloodedly shoots and kills Petrofsky, explaining bluntly afterwards that he had orders to do so.\n\nAt Hemmings' funeral, Preston is unsurprised to find Irvine secretly meeting with General Karpov. Preston had become suspicious when known KGB agent Winkler was used as a courier, making it easy to follow him, and also when Petrofsky was killed instead of being captured for questioning. He surmised that discrediting Govorshin would benefit both Irvine and Karpov (sneering to both that keeping hold over their careers is all that matters to them). Preston does not see any point in exposing them and leaves after expressing his contempt for their cynical power play (Irvine secretly assuring Karpov that they have control over Preston, as they covertly observe him reunite with his young son).\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Michael Caine]] as John Preston\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Major Valeri Alekseyevich Petrofsky / James Edward Ross\n* [[Ned Beatty]] as General Pavel Petrovich Borisov\n* [[Joanna Cassidy]] as Irina Vassilievna\n* [[Julian Glover]] as Brian Harcourt-Smith\n* [[Michael Gough]] as Sir Bernard Hemmings\n* [[Ray McAnally]] as General Yevgeny Sergeyevich Karpov\n* [[Ian Richardson]] as Sir Nigel Irvine\n* [[Anton Rodgers]] as George Berenson\n* [[Caroline Blakiston]] as Angela Berenson\n* [[Joseph Brady (actor)|Joseph Brady]] as Carmichael\n* [[Matt Frewer]] as Tom McWhirter\n* [[Betsy Brantley]] as Eileen McWhirter\n* [[Sean Chapman]] as Captain Lyndhurst\n* [[Alan North]] as General Govorshin\n* [[Ronald Pickup]] as Wynne-Evans\n* [[John Horsley (actor)|John Horsley]] as Sir Anthony Plumb\n* [[Michael Bilton]] as [[Kim Philby]]\n* [[Peter Cartwright (actor)|Peter Cartwright]] as Jan Marais\n* [[Aaron Swartz (actor)|Aaron Schwartz]] as Gregoriev\n* [[Mark Rolston]] as Russian Decoder\n* [[Michael J.

They hired [[George Axelrod]] to write a script and [[John Frankenheimer]] to direct, but were unable to raise finance. Axelrod and Frankenheimer left the project, Forsyth wrote the script himself and they got a new producer and director.<ref name=\"fred\" />\n\n== Locations ==\nMuch of the film was shot in the [[Heelands]] district of [[Milton Keynes]], the main house featured is on Tranlands Brigg, Heelands, Milton Keynes. Scenes set on the [[London Underground]] were shot at [[Charing Cross tube station|Charing Cross]], [[Green Park tube station|Green Park]], and [[Aldwych tube station|Aldwych]] stations. [[Colchester railway station|Colchester Station]] was also used in one scene, with star Michael Caine filmed standing on the tracks.  For some of the interiors, rooms of [[King's College London]] on the [[Strand, London|Strand]] were used. The \"RAF Baywaters\" scenes were filmed at the now defunct [[RAF Upper Heyford]] as a take on the real life [[RAF Bentwaters]]. Filming also took place in [[Finland]]. Towards the end of the film, the car chase in [[Ipswich]] is actually shot in [[Chelmsford]] on the [[A1016 road (Great Britain)#Four-digit roads .2810xx.29|A1016]] Chelmer Valley bypass which at the time was newly built. One shot shows helicopters flying under the [[Orwell Bridge]] which is often considered a local landmark.\n\nEastbourne Mews, W2, was used as the filming location for John Preston's ([[Michael Caine]]) house.<ref>[http://www.lurotbrand.co.uk/flipbook/mewsnews2010-spring/ Mews News]. ''Lurot Brand''. Published Spring 2010. Retrieved 20 September 2013.</ref>\n\n== Differences from the novel ==\n* The film opens with the killing of [[Kim Philby]], who has already planned the operation, because he knows too much. In the book, he remains a key figure. \n* The film begins with Preston breaking into Berenson's house to expose him as a traitor. In the novel, Jim Rawlings, a professional thief, robs Berenson's flat of jewellery. In the process, he discovers illegal copies of classified documents in a briefcase. As a patriotic citizen, he takes them and sends them anonymously to MI5. The character of Rawlings is omitted from the film and the side plot of the disposal of the stolen jewelry is not pursued. In the film, the jewellery is taken by Preston, and returned to Berenson by Irvine. In the novel, the jewellery was destroyed by Rawlings, although Berenson commissions a replica of them using zirconium stones and later permanently deposits them with his bank.\n* The political plot of the book to enable the Labour Party to win the general election and allow for a communist takeover of the party was left out.\n* The film removes a large section of the book in regard to Preston's investigation into Jan Marais in South Africa.\n* The character of the assembler in the book is a man, although the surname is the same. He is killed by getting his neck broken in a forest rather than being shot in bed.\n* In the novel, the Soviet sailor is attacked by street thugs and later commits suicide by jumping from the top floor of a hospital, while in the movie he is hit by a truck.\n* In the book the story about Berenson is linked to the atomic plot because it provides a way for Irvine to send a false message to Karpov suggesting the operation is blown. Karpov, fearful of a scandal then sends Winkler, his worst agent, to help Preston find Petrofsky, hoping that in exchange Irvine will ensure any scandal will be suppressed. The theme is of backchannels between individuals in opposing intelligence services working to counter dangerous opportunism within their governments. The end of the film implies Irvine and Karpov have a much more cynical collaboration simply to help their careers.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film debuted at no. 4 at the box office with $3.6 million in ticket sales.<ref>{{cite news | title = Stakeout' Ranks No. 1 in Box-Office Sales |work= [[The New York Times]]|date=2 September 1987|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/02/movies/stakeout-ranks-no-1-in-box-office-sales.html |access-date= 17 November 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111122050545/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/02/movies/stakeout-ranks-no-1-in-box-office-sales.html | archive-date= 2011-11-22 }}</ref>\n\nIn the UK it made \u00a3766,413.<ref name=\"org\">{{cite web|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/bfi-back-to-the-future-the-fall-and-rise-of-the-british-film-industry-in-the-1980s.pdf|page=22|title=Back to the Future: The Fall and Rise of the British Film Industry in the 1980s - An Information Briefing|website=British Film Institute|date=2005}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] retrospectively gave the film a score of 74% based on reviews from 19 critics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fourth_protocol/|title = The Fourth Protocol|website = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Globe and Mail]]'''s film critic [[Jay Scott]] said that \"the movie is entertaining on a rudimentary, never-to-be-taken-seriously level.
