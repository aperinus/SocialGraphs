While traveling at night on a [[sleeper train]] to [[Yamagata, Yamagata|Yamagata]], she begins to recall memories of herself as a schoolgirl in 1966, and her intense desire to go on holiday like her classmates, all of whom have family outside of the big city.\n\nAt the arrival train station, she is surprised to find out that her brother-in-law's second cousin Toshio, whom she barely knows, is the one who came to pick her up. During her stay in Yamagata, she finds herself increasingly nostalgic and wistful for her childhood self, while simultaneously wrestling with adult issues of career and love. The trip dredges up forgotten memories (not all of them good ones)\u2014the first stirrings of childish romance, [[puberty]] and growing up, the frustrations of math and boys. In lyrical switches between the present and the past, Taeko wonders if she has been true to the dreams of her childhood self. In doing so, she begins to realize that Toshio has helped her along the way. Finally, Taeko faces her own true self, how she views the world and the people around her. Taeko chooses to stay in the countryside instead of returning to Tokyo. It is implied that she and Toshio begin a relationship.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Character\n!

During the course of the film, characters visit prominent locales, including the resort destination of [[Mount Za\u014d]].\n\nUnlike the typical Japanese character animation style, the characters have more realistic facial muscles and expressions due to the dialogue being recorded first (the tradition in Japan is to record it after the animation is completed) and the animators fit the animation to the spoken dialogue. Takahata also had voice actors record some of their lines together, using footage of their performances as a guide for both design and the animation.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> However, the scenes of Taeko's childhood past were animated before the voices were recorded, giving a subtle contrast between the anime style of her childhood and the adult \"reality\" of the framing story.<ref name=\"makingof\"/>\n\nThose scenes set in 1966 with the 10-year-old Taeko are taken from the source material. Takahata had difficulty adapting the episodic manga into a feature film, and he, therefore, invented the framing narrative wherein the adult Taeko journeys to the countryside and falls in love with Toshio.<ref name=\"nausicaa.net-manga\"/>\n\nThere is a repeated [[Eastern European]] theme in the film, particularly in the soundtrack reflecting the peasant lifestyle still present in the area and the parallels this draws with [[Japan]]ese rural life. Folk songs from the area repeatedly occur in the film.
