It recounts the adventures of d'Artagnan on his quest to join the three title characters in becoming a musketeer. However, this adaptation simplifies and alters the story.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1625, young-but-skilled fencer [[Charles de Batz de Castelmore d'Artagnan#Portrayals in fiction|d'Artagnan]] sets off for [[Paris]], [[France]] in hopes to follow in his murdered father's footsteps and become a member of the [[Mousquetaires de la Garde|musketeer]]s: the personal guard of the [[List of French monarchs|King of France]]. He is pursued by G\u00e9rard and his brothers, accused of blemishing their sister's [[honor]]. Meanwhile, [[Comte de Rochefort|Captain Rochefort]] of the [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]]'s Guards disbands the musketeers per the orders of [[Cardinal Richelieu]], the King's Minister, ostensibly to help fight in an impending war with [[England]]. Rochefort informs Richelieu that three musketeers refused to relinquish their duties: [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]], [[Porthos]], and [[Aramis]].\n\nIn Paris, d'Artagnan \"rescues\" the queen's handmaidens from their own bodyguards, and after a scolding, takes a liking to one, Constance. In the city d'Artagnan encounters each of the Three Musketeers separately, unaware of their identities or association, resulting in a separate duel arranged with each. At the arranged location, Athos, Porthos and Aramis reveal themselves as musketeers to d'Artagnan's surprise. Before they can duel, a Captain of the Cardinal's Guard arrives with four other guards to arrest the musketeers; although d'Artagnan is not sought by the guards, he allies with the musketeers during the skirmish. The Musketeers kill four guards, while d'Artagnan outduels the Captain, who falls to his death. Impressed but displeased at d'Artagnan's involvement, the musketeers leave d'Artagnan behind after encouraging him to flee and maintain his innocence. When more of the Cardinal's Guards arrive, d'Artagnan is captured.\n\nD'Artagnan escapes his cell and eavesdrops on a conversation between Richelieu and the mysterious [[Milady de Winter]], where the Cardinal plots to supplant the King, tasking Milady with delivering a secret [[treaty]] to England's [[Duke of Buckingham]]. D'Artagnan is caught by Rochefort without having seen Milady's face. Richelieu orders him executed for refusing to give up the musketeers' location, but he is saved by the musketeers. As they flee, d'Artagnan reveals Richelieu's plans; they decide to intercept the spy at Calais and retrieve the treaty to prove Richelieu's guilt.\n\nDuring a skirmish, the party splits up; d'Artagnan rides ahead to Calais, but passes out from exhaustion and is found by Milady de Winter. He wakes in a bed stripped of his weapons and clothes as Milady tries to seduce him. d'Artagnan speaks openly of his plans, not knowing she is the spy. She attempts to kill him, but he convinces her to keep him alive. As her party boards the boat to England, they are confronted by the musketeers. Milady attempts to run away but is stopped by Athos, who is revealed to have been her first husband, but betrayed her to the authorities when he found out she was branded a murderer. The musketeers retrieve the treaty and Milady is sentenced to death for the murder of her second husband, Lord de Winter; just before she is executed, Athos begs her forgiveness. Moved, she reveals the Cardinal's plans to assassinate the king at his birthday celebration, then throws herself off a cliff to her death.\n\nAthos, Porthos and Aramis send missives to rally the rest of the musketeers. Richelieu and Rochefort hired a [[sharpshooter]]; during the assembly, d'Artagnan interrupts the sniper's shot, which narrowly misses the king. The musketeers reveal themselves, and Richelieu blames them for the attempted assassination.\n\nAs the three face off with the Cardinal's guards, men rush to their aid and reveal themselves as musketeers. The two forces battle as Richelieu takes the king and queen hostage, shooting Aramis in the chest before fleeing to the dungeon with Athos and Porthos in pursuit. d'Artagnan duels Rochefort and is disarmed; as Rochefort gloats about having killed d'Artagnan's father, Constance retrieves and throws him his sword and d'Artagnan promptly kills Rochefort.\n\nAthos and Porthos arrive just as Richelieu's boat leaves on an underground river, with Richelieu vowing to return. The boatman then reveals himself as Aramis, his crucifix having stopped the bullet. Aramis moves to apprehend the Cardinal, but King Louis punches Richelieu himself, knocking him into the river.\n\nThe musketeers are reinstated by the king, and d'Artagnan is offered anything he wants; he chooses to serve Louis as a musketeer. Outside the musketeer headquarters, G\u00e9rard and his brothers arrive and challenge d'Artagnan to a duel; Porthos reminds him that musketeers not only protect King and country, but also each other. G\u00e9rard and his brothers are then chased off by the entire musketeer division.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Charlie Sheen]] as [[Aramis]]\n*[[Kiefer Sutherland]] as [[Athos (character)|Athos]]\n*[[Chris O'Donnell]] as [[Charles de Batz de Castelmore d'Artagnan|D'Artagnan]]\n*[[Oliver Platt]] as [[Porthos]]\n*[[Tim Curry]] as [[Cardinal Richelieu]]\n*[[Rebecca De Mornay]] as [[Milady de Winter]]\n*[[Gabrielle Anwar]] as [[Anne of Austria|Queen Anne]]\n*[[Michael Wincott]] as [[Comte de Rochefort|Captain Rochefort]]\n*[[Paul McGann]] as Girard and Jussac\n*[[Julie Delpy]] as Constance\n*[[Hugh O'Conor]] as [[Louis XIII of France|King Louis]]\n*[[Christopher Adamson (actor)|Christopher Adamson]] as Henri\n*[[Herbert Fux]] as an Innkeeper\n*[[Bob Anderson (fencer)|Bob Anderson]] (Uncredited) as The King's Fencing Instructor\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nIn 1992 [[Walt Disney Pictures]], [[Columbia Pictures]], and [[TriStar Pictures]] simultaneously began development on three separate adaptations of ''The Three Musketeers''. Disney purchased a screenplay for the film from [[David Loughery]] for $650,000 after he had already been hired to write the screenplay of the Columbia adaptation, and Columbia producer [[Brad Wyman]] accused Disney of stealing concepts which were its intellectual property. The matter was settled out of court, and the Columbia adaptation was cancelled. The TriStar adaptation was to be written by Joel Gross and directed by [[Jeremiah S. Chechik]], and was to be more adult-oriented and faithful to [[Alexandre Dumas]]' original novel than the Disney version.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |title=AFI{{!}}Catalog |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/59682-THE-THREEMUSKETEERS?sid=7eb9bc46-eff9-4c62-ad76-6721be1e4525&sr=8.486375&cp=1&pos=3 |access-date=2022-06-11 |website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Charlie Sheen]] was originally sought for the role of [[Porthos]] before he was cast as [[Aramis]], while [[Brendan Fraser]] was the first choice for the role of 'dArtagnan. [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Stephen Dorff]] also turned down the role of [[Charles de Batz de Castelmore d'Artagnan|d'Artagnan]], which ultimately went to O'Donnell. [[William Baldwin]], [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]], [[Al Pacino]], [[Johnny Depp]], [[Cary Elwes]], [[Robert Downey Jr.]], and [[Gary Oldman]] were also sought out by Disney for parts in the film. [[Winona Ryder]] was considered for the role of [[Milady de Winter]], but dropped out and [[Rebecca De Mornay]] was cast. [[Kiefer Sutherland]], [[Chris O'Donnell]] and [[Oliver Platt]] all endured six weeks of fencing and riding lessons. Sheen missed this training as he was still filming ''[[Hot Shots! Part Deux]]''. Depp was cast in Chechik's adaptation at TriStar after Baldwin, Downey Jr., and Sutherland were also considered for roles in the film. Oliver Platt had also been approached to play [[Porthos]] in that version as well.

Jordan Kerner and Jon Avnet were briefly involved with the film but also quit in order to focus on [[When a Man Loves a Woman (film)|''When a Man Loves a Woman'']]. Disney President David Haberman hired [[Caravan Pictures]] under [[Joe Roth]] and [[Roger Birnbaum]] to produce the film.

After initially settling on [[Barrandov Studios]] in [[Prague]], the production moved to Vienna after the local government offered $2 million. Principal photography began on April 26, 1993, with a budget of $30 million.

Some sequences were shot in Cornwall, UK. A small woods called [[River Fowey|Golitha Falls]] was used in one sequence when the [[musketeer]]s are being pursued by guards. The small harbor village of Charlestown is home to the galleon that was used in a night-shoot.<ref name=Carlito />\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film was highly anticipated after Disney announced that its September 1993 test screenings for the film showed the most positive response it had ever received from an audience.
