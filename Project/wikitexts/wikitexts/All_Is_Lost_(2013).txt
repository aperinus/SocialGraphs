The film stars [[Robert Redford]] as a man lost at sea.{{refn|group=upper-alpha|Redford is credited as \"Our Man\", but the character is not named in the film.<ref name=\"Crompton\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10527553/The-making-of-All-is-Lost-Robert-Redford-lied-to-me.html |title=The making of All is Lost: 'Robert Redford lied to me' |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=December 19, 2013 |first1=Sarah |last1=Crompton |access-date=June 23, 2014}}</ref>}} Redford is the only cast member, and the film has 51 spoken English words. ''All Is Lost'' is Chandor's second feature film, following his 2011 debut ''[[Margin Call (film)|Margin Call]]''. It screened [[Cannes Film Festival#Programmes|Out of Competition]] at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nThe title of the film is a nod to [[E. W. Hornung]]'s observation that when courage is lost, \"all is lost\".\n\nAmong many honors, the film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] ([[Steve Boeddeker]] and [[Richard Hymns]]) and won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]] ([[Alex Ebert]]). Redford was nominated for his own [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]] and won the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with a flash-forward in which a man, played by [[Robert Redford]], narrates a letter addressing people he will miss, as the camera pans across a lost [[Intermodal container|shipping container]].\n\nIn the [[Indian Ocean]] eight days earlier, the man wakes to find water flooding his boat. It has collided with a wayward [[intermodal container|shipping container]], ripping a hole in the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]. The man uses a [[sea anchor]] to dislodge the container, then changes course to tilt the boat away from the hole. He patches the hole and uses a manual [[bilge pump]] to remove the water from the cabin. The boat's navigational and communications systems have been damaged by saltwater intrusion. The man tries to repair the [[marine radio]] and connects it to one of the boat's batteries. When he climbs the mast to repair an antenna lead, he sees an oncoming [[tropical storm]].\n\nWhen the storm arrives, the man [[Point of sail#Running downwind|runs before the wind]]. He intends to [[Heaving to|heave to]], but as he crawls to the bow to hoist the [[storm jib]], he is thrown overboard and only regains the deck after a desperate struggle. The boat [[capsizes]] and rights itself; during a second roll, which throws the man overboard again, the boat is dis-masted and most of the equipment is destroyed. After going below deck and being knocked out by colliding with a post, he regains consciousness to find the boat sinking, so he abandons ship in an inflatable [[life raft]]. When the storm has passed, he salvages whatever he can from his sinking boat and transfers it to the raft. Before the boat sinks, he tends to the gash on his forehead.\n\nAs the man learns to operate a [[sextant]], he discovers he is being pulled towards a major [[shipping lanes|shipping lane]] by [[ocean currents]]. He survives another storm but his supplies dwindle, and he learns too late that his drinking water has been contaminated with sea water. He improvises a [[solar still]] from his water container, a plastic bag, and an aluminum can, producing fresh water, and he snags a fish, but it is snapped up by a shark before he can reel it in.\n\nThe man is passed by two [[container ship]]s, but he is unseen despite him using signaling [[flare]]s. He drifts out of the shipping lane with no food or water. On the eighth day, he writes a letter, puts it in a jar, and throws it in the ocean as a [[message in a bottle]]. Later that night, he sees a light in the distance. He uses pages from his journal along with charts to create a signal fire. The fire grows out of control and consumes his raft. He falls into the water and allows himself to sink. Underwater, he sees the hull of a boat with a search light approaching his burning raft. He swims towards the surface to grasp an outstretched hand.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''All Is Lost'' was written and directed by [[J. C. Chandor]], his second feature film, following 2011's ''[[Margin Call (film)|Margin Call]]''. Chandor developed the idea for ''All Is Lost'' during his time commuting from [[Providence, Rhode Island]] to [[New York City]].<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite web|last=Dowd|first=Maureen|title=The Sun-Dried Kid: Robert Redford Goes to Sea in 'All Is Lost'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/movies/robert-redford-goes-to-sea-in-all-is-lost.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=October 16, 2013|page=2|date=October 9, 2013}}</ref> After meeting [[Robert Redford]] at the [[2011 Sundance Film Festival]], where ''Margin Call'' premiered, Chandor asked the veteran actor to be in the film.
