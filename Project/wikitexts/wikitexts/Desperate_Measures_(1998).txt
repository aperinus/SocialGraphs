The film was released on January 30, 1998 and was a [[box office bomb|critical and financial failure]]. However, Andy Garc\u00eda won an [[ALMA Award]] for \"Outstanding Actor in a Feature Film in a Crossover Role\".<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS -->\n\n==Plot==\n[[San Francisco]] police officer and widowed father Frank Conner is in a frantic search for a compatible [[bone marrow]] [[donor]] for his [[leukemia]]-stricken son, Matt. In desperation, he breaks into [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] headquarters and finds a perfect match. Unfortunately, it is Peter McCabe, a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] who is serving [[life in prison]] for several murders. During his time in prison, the brutal, cunning McCabe has attempted escape and killed several guards and fellow prisoners, and must be kept in multiple restraints when out of the [[Security Housing Unit|SHU]] in the supermax at [[Pelican Bay State Prison]].\n\nMcCabe initially shows little interest in helping Conner, but later finds an opportunity to turn the situation to his advantage and devises a plot to escape. Biding his time, McCabe plays chess against a computer, easily defeating the program, and expresses the need for a challenge akin to [[Garry Kasparov]] or [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]]. Meanwhile, Conner, along with police captain Cassidy and Matt's physician, Dr. Hawkins, prepare for McCabe to be transferred to the hospital for the [[organ transplant]].\n\nAt the hospital, McCabe is given a [[sedative]]. With the aid of a counteracting drug he had obtained from a fellow inmate, McCabe slips out of his restraints, attacks the guards and attempts to escape. Conner and a fellow officer corner him, but McCabe holds a [[scalpel]] to Hawkins' throat, prompting Conner to drop his gun. The other officer gets the drop on McCabe, but Hawkins warns the police that if he dies, his bone marrow becomes useless. Conner stands in the way of the other officer; McCabe takes his gun and shoots the officer.\n\nAfter hearing what happened, Cassidy immediately orders Conner off the case and removed from the scene. Conner breaks free to search the hospital for McCabe on his own. McCabe causes an explosion with propane tanks, seizes control of the hospital's adjacent wing, holds guards hostage and orders a [[lockdown]] of the building.\n\nConner and Hawkins make their way to McCabe and convince him to let them inside so that Hawkins can attend to Matt. As McCabe watches Conner on the security cameras, he realizes that his nemesis is a truly devoted father, and develops a grudging respect for him. Conner intervenes when McCabe is about to ambush Cassidy and his [[SWAT]] team with a set of tanks of [[cyclopropane]]. Cassidy is furious that Conner continues to aid an escaped convict, while McCabe is angry that Conner foiled his plan. He kidnaps Matt and descends to the sub-levels of the building.\n\nMatt tries to wound McCabe to give his father a better chance; impressed, McCabe spares Matt and leaves him at the hospital for Conner to find. McCabe then escapes into San Francisco, where he steals a car. Conner chases McCabe to a bridge, still needing him captured alive. Cassidy and his men arrive in a helicopter and a sniper opens fire. Conner again shields McCabe and is wounded in the arm. McCabe attempts to flee, but Conner is determined not to let him go. Conner wounds McCabe, sending him off the bridge and into the bay. Conner then dives in and saves him.\n\nBack in the hospital, a wounded McCabe agrees to the transplant, which saves Matt's life. Even though his career is clearly over, Conner is overjoyed that his son will live. McCabe is informed by a guard that the surgery went well. As the bed reclines upwards and McCabe looks at the guard menacingly, the guard suddenly realizes that his gun is gone. McCabe holds it over the guard and asks, \"What kind of car do you have?\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Keaton]] as Peter J.
