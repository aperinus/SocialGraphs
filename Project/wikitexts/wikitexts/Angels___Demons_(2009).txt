It is the sequel to the 2006 film ''[[The Da Vinci Code (film)|The Da Vinci Code]]'', also directed by Howard, and the second installment in the [[Robert Langdon (film series)|''Robert Langdon'' film series]]. However, the novel version was published before ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' novel. Filming took place in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], and the [[Sony Pictures Studios]] in [[Culver City, California]]. [[Tom Hanks]] reprises his role as Professor [[Robert Langdon]], while [[Ayelet Zurer]] stars as Dr. Vittoria Vetra, a [[CERN]] scientist joining Langdon in the quest to recover a missing vial of [[antimatter]] from a mysterious [[Illuminati]] terrorist. Producer [[Brian Grazer]], composer [[Hans Zimmer]] and screenwriter [[Akiva Goldsman]] also return, with [[David Koepp]] coming on board to help the latter.\n\nThe film was different from the novel in some scenes. The film grossed $485&nbsp;million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, who considered it an improvement over its predecessor. A sequel, titled ''[[Inferno (2016 film)|Inferno]]'', was released on October 28, 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Catholic Church]] mourns the sudden death of [[Pope]] Pius XVI, and prepares for the [[papal conclave]] to elect his successor in [[Vatican City]]. Father Patrick McKenna, the [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|camerlengo]], takes temporary control of the Vatican during the ''[[sede vacante]]'' period.\n\nMeanwhile, at [[CERN]], scientists Father Silvano Bentivoglio and Dr. Vittoria Vetra create three canisters of [[antimatter]]. As Vetra goes to evaluate the experiment, she discovers that Silvano has been murdered, and one of the canisters was stolen.  Shortly thereafter, four of the ''[[papabile|preferiti]]'', the favored candidates to be elected pope, are kidnapped by a man claiming to represent the [[Illuminati]]. He sends the Vatican a warning, claiming he will murder each of the cardinals from 8{{nbsp}}p.m. to midnight, when the stolen antimatter will explode and destroy the city, hidden somewhere within.\n\nHaving attracted the [[Catholic Church|Church]]\u2019s attention after searching for the [[Priory of Sion]] [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|in Paris and London]], American [[symbologist]] Professor [[Robert Langdon]] is brought to the Vatican to help. After listening to the assassin's threat, he deduces that the four cardinals will be murdered on the four altars of the \"Path of Illumination\", in locations relevant to the [[classical elements]]. McKenna gives Langdon access to the [[Vatican Secret Archives]] to research the altars, against the wishes of Commander Richter, head of the [[Swiss Guard]]. Langdon and Dr. Vetra examine [[Galileo Galilei]]'s [[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|banned book]], finding clues to the first altar. Initially believing it to be at the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], they eventually discover it to be the [[Chigi Chapel]]. Though they rush to the chapel, accompanied by Ernesto Olivetti and Claudio Vincenzi of the [[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City]], they are too late to save Cardinal Ebner, who is found dead, having suffocated on a mouthful of dirt and branded with the [[ambigram]]matic word \"Earth\".\n\nFollowing the clue left by a Bernini statue at the Chigi Chapel, Langdon discovers the second altar to be a Bernini-created sculpture in [[St. Peter's Square]]. Upon reaching it, they find Cardinal Lamass\u00e9 mortally wounded, his lungs punctured and his chest branded with the ambigram \"Air\". After reading a threatening note left on Lamass\u00e9's body, Vetra comes to suspect that Pius XVI did not die of a stroke as believed, but was actually murdered with an overdose of [[tinzaparin]], which he had been secretly taking for his [[thrombophlebitis]]. This is confirmed when McKenna and Vetra secretly inspect the body in the Vatican necropolis. After returning to the Archives for further research, Langdon, Olivetti, and Vincenzi eventually identify the [[Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome|Santa Maria della Vittoria]] as the altar of fire, where they fail to save Cardinal Guidera, branded with the ambigram \"Fire\" from burning to death when the assassin appears, who kills everyone except Langdon before escaping.\n\nAfter consulting a map of Rome, Langdon identifies the final altar as [[Piazza Navona]]'s ''Four Rivers'' sculpture. Escorted by two Vatican police officers, they find the assassin attempting to drown Cardinal Baggia, who is branded with the ambigram \"Water\", in the [[Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi]]. The officers are killed by the assassin, but Langdon manages to rescue Baggia with the timely help of bystanders. Baggia tells Langdon he was held with the ''preferiti'' in [[Castel Sant'Angelo]].\n\nRichter confiscates Dr. Silvano's journals, thus convincing Vetra that he is a conspirator. Langdon, Vetra, and the police storm Castel Sant'Angelo. Langdon and Vetra find the assassin's lair, discovering the four [[Branding iron|brands]] used on the cardinals, and deduce that the missing fifth is meant for McKenna. Before escaping, the assassin claims he was hired by \"men of God\". Guided to a car by his unseen contractor, the assassin is killed when the vehicle is destroyed by a [[car bomb]]. Langdon and Vetra find a secret passageway leading to the Vatican, warning the Swiss Guard of McKenna's fate. They find Richter hovering over a branded McKenna. Richter and Archbishop Simeon, an alleged conspirator, are killed. Langdon retrieves a key from the dying Richter's hand.\n\nThe antimatter container is found in [[Saint Peter's tomb]], due to detonate in five minutes, the cold temperature preventing its battery from being changed in time (according to Vetra, the device would not have enough residual charge to keep the antimatter in suspension). McKenna, a former helicopter pilot, seizes the canister and pilots a [[helicopter]] into the sky, parachuting out seconds before the antimatter detonates. The explosion unleashes a powerful, blinding shockwave that causes damage and injuries throughout Vatican City but no lives are lost and the Church is saved. McKenna is hailed as a hero, with calls for him to be elected pope by [[Acclamation (Papal elections)|acclamation]].\n\nLangdon and Vetra retrieve Silvano's journals from Richter's office, finding he kept tabs on the Pope with hidden security cameras for medical reasons. Using the key Langdon retrieved from Richter, they discover that McKenna was the true mastermind behind the attacks. The Pope had invited Silvano to publicly present the antimatter as proof of a divine power, bridging the gap between religion and science and potentially ending the conflict between them. Considering such a claim blasphemy, McKenna orchestrated Pius XVI's death and hired the assassin, plotting to have himself elected as pope while making the Illuminati the [[scapegoat]]. The footage is shown to the papal conclave. McKenna, realizing he has been exposed, commits suicide via [[self-immolation]] after refusing to be taken alive.\n\nThe following morning, Cardinal Baggia is elected as the new pope. He chooses to take the name Pope Luke, an allusion to the [[Luke the Evangelist|biblical Luke]] being both a doctor and an apostle\u2014symbolically bridging the gap between science and religion. The Vatican also announces McKenna has died from injuries from his parachute landing, which leads to calls for sainthood (since the people are not aware that he was the mastermind). Cardinal Strauss, the Pope's new camerlengo, gives Galileo's book to Langdon as thanks for his help, asking that he ensure it returns to the Vatican in his last will and testament. Pope Luke gives Langdon and Vetra a thankful nod, before stepping out on the balcony to greet the crowd below and give the traditional first ''[[Urbi et Orbi]]'' as pope.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Angels & Demons characters}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Robert Langdon]], a [[Harvard University]] professor of [[symbology]].\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as Father Patrick McKenna, the [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|camerlengo]].\n* [[Ayelet Zurer]] as Dr. Vittoria Vetra, a [[CERN]] scientist whose [[antimatter]] experiment has allegedly been stolen by the [[Illuminati]].\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Commander Maximilian Richter, head of the [[Swiss Guard]].\n* [[Pierfrancesco Favino]] as [[Inspector General#Vatican City|Inspector General]] Ernesto Olivetti of the [[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|Gendarme Corps of Vatican City State]].\n* [[Nikolaj Lie Kaas]] as the assassin\n* [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]] as Cardinal Strauss, [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]] and the papal conclave.\n* [[Thure Lindhardt]] as Lieutenant Chartrand, officer of the [[Swiss Guard]].\n* [[David Pasquesi]] as Claudio Vincenzi, a Vatican police officer sent to summon Langdon.\n* [[Cosimo Fusco]] as Archbishop Simeon, prefect of the papal household.\n* [[Victor Alfieri]] as Lieutenant Valenti, a [[Carabinieri]] officer who takes Langdon to the [[Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi|Fountain of the Four Rivers]].\n* [[Carmen Argenziano]] as Father Silvano Bentivoglio, a [[Catholic priest]] and a [[CERN]] scientist who performed the [[antimatter]] experiment along with Dr. Vetra.\n* [[Marc Fiorini]] as Cardinal Baggia/Pope Luke, one of the four ''[[Papabile|preferiti]]'' and a cardinal from [[Milan]], Italy and the favorite to succeed as the new pope.\n* [[Bob Yerkes]] as Cardinal Guidera, one of the four ''preferiti'' and a cardinal from [[Barcelona]], Spain.\n* Franklin Amobi as Cardinal Lamass\u00e9, one of the four ''preferiti'' and a cardinal from Paris, France.\n* [[Curt Lowens]] as Cardinal Ebner, one of the four ''preferiti'' and a cardinal from [[Frankfurt]], Germany.\n* Todd Schneider as a [[Carabiniere]], Lieutenant Valenti's partner who along with him takes Langdon to the [[Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi|Fountain of the Four Rivers]].\n* [[Anna Katarina]] as a [[Museum docent|docent]], the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] tour guide who tells Langdon the name of the first church.\n* Howard Mungo as Cardinal Yoruba\n* [[Rance Howard]] as Cardinal Beck\n* [[Steve Franken]] as Cardinal Colbert\n* [[Gino Conforti]] as Cardinal Pugini\n* [[Elya Baskin]] as Cardinal Petrov\n* [[August Wittgenstein]] as a Swiss Guard\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nIn 2003, Sony Pictures acquired the film rights to ''[[Angels & Demons]]'' along with ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' in a deal with author [[Dan Brown]].

This is due to the fact that ''The Da Vinci Code'' was adapted to film before ''Angels & Demons''. \n* In the book, the assassin has Middle Eastern looks, whereas in the film he is portrayed by a Danish actor. In the film, he is killed by a car bomb, whereas in the book he falls from a balcony at the top of the [[Castel Sant Angelo]]. He consequently breaks his back on a pile of marble cannonballs, an injury which eventually kills him.\n* In the novel, Vittoria is kidnapped, whereas, in the film, she accompanies Langdon almost everywhere.\n*In the book, all four ''preferiti'' are killed by the assassin and eventually the high elector, Cardinal Saverio Mortati, is elected as the new pope, whereas in the film, the fourth ''preferito'', Cardinal Baggia, is saved by Langdon and is elected the new pope. The high elector, renamed Cardinal Strauss, becomes the camerlengo to the new pope.\n* In the book, the fifth brand is one that incorporates all four words from the previous four, whereas in the film, the fifth brand is the crossed keys, symbolic of the papacy.\n* The means by which the heroes discover the location of the bomb is significantly different. In the book, the Camerlengo feigns a religious vision from God, telling him where to find the bomb. In the film, he feeds Langdon a clue to the bomb's location by branding himself with an upside-down version of the papal keys, which Langdon successfully deduces is a metaphor for [[Saint Peter]], the first pope, who was crucified upside-down.\n* In the book, Langdon stows away on the Camerlengo's helicopter, and just before the antimatter explosion, jumps out using a makeshift parachute, and lands on [[Isola Tiberina]], whose mythical healing powers heal the injuries he incurs from the fall. In the film, Langdon does not get on the helicopter.\n* In the book's closing scenes, a Swiss Guard hands Langdon the fifth brand, the Illuminati diamond, as a gift. In the film, the new Camerlengo hands over Galileo's book to Langdon.\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography|Shooting]] began on June 4, 2008, in Rome under the [[title ruse|fake working title]] ''Obelisk''.<ref name=\"stop\">{{cite news|author=Elisabetta Povoledo |title=Dan Brown Tourists: Next Stop, Rome? |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 24, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/movies/24ange.html?ref=movies |access-date=August 26, 2008}}</ref> The filmmakers scheduled three weeks of exterior location filming because of a predicted [[2008 Screen Actors Guild strike]] on June 30.

As there had been filming at the real Piazza Navona, the transition between it and the replica had to be seamless. To present the [[Santa Maria del Popolo]] undergoing renovation, a police station in Rome opposite the real church was used for the exterior; the scaffolding would hide that it was not the church. Cameron built the interior of Santa Maria del Popolo on the same set as the recreated [[Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome|Santa Maria della Vittoria]] to save money; the scaffolding also disguised this.
