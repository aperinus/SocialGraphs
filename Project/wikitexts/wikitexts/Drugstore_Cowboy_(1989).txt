Written by Van Sant and Daniel Yost, and based on an [[autobiographical novel]] by [[James Fogle]], the film stars [[Matt Dillon]], [[Kelly Lynch]], [[Heather Graham]] and [[William S. Burroughs]]. It was Van Sant's second film as director.\n\nAt the time the film was made, the source novel by Fogle was unpublished. It was later published in 1990,<ref>{{ISBN|0-385-30224-X}} [https://www.amazon.com/Drugstore-Cowboy-James-Fogle/dp/038530224X \"''Drugstore Cowboy''\"].</ref> by which time Fogle had been released from prison. Fogle, like the characters in his story, was a long-time [[Recreational drug use|drug use]]r and [[Drug dealer|dealer]].\n\nThe film received widespread acclaim from critics.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1971, 26-year-old Bob Hughes leads a nomadic group of drug addicts\u2014his wife Dianne, his best friend Rick, and Rick's teenage girlfriend Nadine\u2014who travel across the [[Pacific Northwest]] robbing pharmacies and hospitals to support their habits.\n\nAfter stealing from a [[Portland, Oregon]], pharmacy, they drive home to get [[Substance intoxication|high]], and are visited by David, a local low-life seeking hard-to-find [[Dilaudid]]. Bob claims they have none but offers to trade him [[morphine]] for [[amphetamine|speed]]. Initially reluctant, David is persuaded to trade and leaves. Later, police officers led by Detective Gentry, who correctly assumes the group is responsible for the pharmacy robbery, raid and wreck their apartment in an unsuccessful search for the stolen drugs, which Dianne has buried outside.\n\nAfter moving to another apartment, Bob realizes that Gentry has the group under surveillance. Bob proceeds to devise an elaborate ruse which results in one of the policemen, Trousinski, being mistaken for a [[Voyeurism|peeper]] by a neighbor who shoots and injures him. The next day, a furious Gentry assaults Bob. Believing a [[curse|hex]] has been brought upon them, the group goes \"crossroading\" and robs a drugstore via an open [[Transom (architectural)|transom]]. They find their haul includes vials of pure powdered Dilaudid worth thousands of dollars each. Declaring that, \"when you're hot, you're hot,\" Bob convinces Dianne that he should rob a hospital.\n\nDuring the robbery, Bob is almost captured and the group returns to their motel to find Nadine has fatally [[Drug overdose|overdose]]d on a stolen bottle of Dilaudid. According to Bob, she has also put \"the worst of all hexes\" on them by leaving a hat on her bed. After temporarily storing Nadine's body in the motel's attic, they are alerted by the motel manager that their room was previously booked for a sheriffs' convention and they must check out. Bob, suffering tremendous anxiety and stress-induced visions of handcuffs and prison, sneaks the body out of the motel in a garment bag. Before burying Nadine in a forest, Bob tells Dianne that he is going to get [[sobriety|clean]] and begin a 21-day [[methadone]] treatment program. Shocked by Bob's decision, Dianne refuses to join him.\n\nBob moves into a long-stay motel in Portland and gets a low-level manufacturing job. At the [[methadone clinic]], he encounters an elderly, drug-addicted priest named Tom, whom Bob remembers from his days as an [[altar boy]]. Gentry pays a visit to the motel and says that Trousinski has been making threats against Bob, whom Gentry encourages to stay sober. Bob later witnesses David bullying a young man who supposedly owes him money. Bob intervenes and lets the man escape, much to David's frustration.\n\nOne night, Dianne arrives at the motel and reveals that she is now in a relationship with Rick, the group's new leader. Dianne asks Bob what happened on the road to make him change his life, and he answers that Nadine's death, the hex she put on them, and the possibility of serious prison time contributed to his decision. He reveals a deal he made with a higher power: if he could get Nadine's body out of the motel, past the cops, and into the ground, he would straighten out his life. Bob suggests Dianne stay the night with him, but she declines, and gives Bob a package of drugs before leaving. Bob gives the drugs to Tom (who rejects all of them except for a bottle of Dilaudid). Returning to his room, Bob is attacked by two masked figures, one of whom is David, who think he has drugs. Bob tells them that he is clean, but David does not believe this and shoots him. A neighbor phones for help, and Bob is loaded onto a stretcher. Asked who shot him, Bob tells Gentry it was \"the hat.\"\n\nWhile riding in the ambulance, Bob concludes via a voiceover that he has \"paid his debt to the hat\" and so can resort to his former lifestyle without breaking his commitment. He is amused by the perceived irony of the police driving him to a hospital \u2014 \"the fattest pharmacy in town.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Matt Dillon]] as Bob Hughes\n* [[Kelly Lynch]] as Dianne Hughes\n* [[James LeGros]] as Rick\n* [[Heather Graham]] as Nadine\n* [[Max Perlich]] as David\n* [[James Remar]] as Gentry\n* [[Grace Zabriskie]] as Mrs. Hughes\n* [[William S. Burroughs]] as Father Tom Murphy\n\n== Production ==\n[[Tom Waits]] was Van Sant's first choice to play the lead although the finance company would not support Van Sant if he had cast him. Officially the reason given was that Waits was appearing in another movie they were financing although Van Sant has said he suspected the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] win of ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (film)|Kiss of the Spider Woman]]'', a film they had also financed, had made them want a lead who could win an Oscar.<ref name=\"Indiewire\">{{cite web|last1=Bernstein|first1=Paula|title=Gus Van Sant: On Working with William S.
