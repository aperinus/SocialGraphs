A young girl alone on a remote island seeks help from an [[Agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] San Franciscan author. While the author attempts to overcome her agoraphobia to search for her, Nim tries to overcome her fear of losing her father. It stars [[Abigail Breslin]], [[Jodie Foster]], and [[Gerard Butler]], and was released on 4 April 2008 by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics and earned $100.1 million on a $37 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n11-year-old Nim ([[Abigail Breslin]]) lives with her [[widower]] [[marine biologist]] father Jack Rusoe ([[Gerard Butler]]) on a [[South Sea Islands|South Pacific]] island. Jack has told Nim that her mother Emily died when she was swallowed by a [[blue whale]] after it was scared by a ship called ''The Buccaneer''. Nim has several native animals for company: [[Selkie]] the [[sea lion]], Fred the [[bearded dragon]], Chica the [[sea turtle]], and [[Galileo]] the [[pelican]].\n\nJack takes the boat for a two-day scientific mission to find ''[[Protozoa]] nim'', a new species of [[plankton]] he has named after her. He wants to take Nim along but she convinces him she can manage on her own and must stay to oversee the imminent hatching of Chica's eggs. They will be able to communicate by [[satellite phone]].\n\nNim is fond of \"Alex Rover\" adventure books written by Alexandra Rover ([[Jodie Foster]]). Nim receives an email addressed to her father from \"Alex Rover\" enquiring about Jack's field of knowledge. She imagines it is from the explorer but is actually from the author. The author, in turn, is a [[neuroticism|neurotic]] [[agoraphobe]] who imagines she is speaking to her fictional hero Alex Rover (also portrayed by Butler). An email conversation follows.\n\nJack\u2019s sailboat has a problem in a [[cyclone]] and cannot return on the planned day, nor communicate with Nim. Galileo brings Jack things he needs to fix his ship as [[shark]]s begin to circle. Nim tells Alex her father has not returned as planned but she feels powerless to help, given that she can hardly even open her own door.\n\nThe island is visited by uncouth tourists who Nim believes to be [[pirates]], as the name of their [[cruise liner]] is ''The Buccaneer.'' She attempts to make the island unattractive to them by catapulting lizards to shore, and by making a fire in the crater of the [[volcano]] and rolling [[boulder]]s down the slopes to make it appear to be [[Types of volcanic eruptions|erupting]]. In so doing she inadvertently triggers an actual eruption. The tourists scramble for the boats. One of them, a boy, Edmund, sees and catches up with Nim. He is confused by her presence and she tells him she lives on the island. He tells the others, but no one believes him.\n\nMeanwhile, Alexandra's visions of her character Alex Rover help her to overcome her agoraphobia in order to travel to the island to rescue Nim. Nim, expecting \"Alex\" (the fictional male character), at first rejects Alexandra, but later relents and they share a meal.\n\nThe next day, Nim starts to cry, reasoning that if her ever-successful father were still alive he would be back already. Luckily, Jack reaches the island [[windsurfing]] on a makeshift [[catamaran]]. Jack and Alex meet and begin to get to know each other (Alex amazed at Jack being just as she imagined her fictional character). The film ends with everyone playing on the beach, using a [[coconut]] as a ball.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Abigail Breslin]] as Nim Rusoe<ref name=circle>{{cite news | author=Michael Fleming | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117962329.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Foster, Breslin circle 'Island' | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=1 April 2007 | access-date=24 December 2007 }}</ref>\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Alexandra \"Alex\" Rover<ref name=circle/>\n* [[Gerard Butler]] as Jack Rusoe / Alex Rover<ref name=sail>{{cite news | author=Pamela McClintock | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117965182.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Butler sets sail for 'Island' | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=17 May 2007 | access-date=24 December 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-11-08-nimsisland_N.htm | title=First look: All is idyllic on 'Nim's Island' | publisher=USA Today | author=Susan Wloszczyna | access-date=11 January 2008 | date=9 November 2007}}</ref>\n* [[Anthony Simcoe]] as First Mate\n* [[Alphonso McAuley]] as Russell<ref name=coming>{{cite web | url=https://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=20470 | title=Nim's Island | publisher=ComingSoon.net | access-date=24 December 2007 }}</ref>\n* [[Morgan Griffin]] as Alice<ref name=cinema>{{cite web | url=http://www.cinemaclock.com/aw/crva.aw/ont/Windsor/e/13339/Nim_s_Island.html | title=Nim's Island | publisher=cinemaclock.com | access-date=9 January 2008}}</ref>\n* [[Michael Carman]] as [[Sea captain|Captain]]\n* [[Christopher James Baker|Christopher Baker]] as [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]]\n* [[Maddison Joyce]] as Edmund\n* [[Peter Callan]] as Edmund's Father\n\n==Production==\nShooting took place on [[Hinchinbrook Island]], off the northeast coast of [[Queensland]], [[Australia]] over three weeks and ended in October 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-10-04/nims-island-filming-reaps-spectacular-hinchinbrook/688612|title=Nim's Island filming reaps 'spectacular' Hinchinbrook footage|work=[[ABC Online]]|date=3 October 2007|access-date=8 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 51% of 104 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.7/10.
