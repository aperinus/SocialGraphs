The film, starring ''[[American Idol]]'' [[American Idol (season 1)|first season]] winner [[Kelly Clarkson]] and runner-up [[Justin Guarini]], won the [[24th Golden Raspberry Awards|Golden Raspberry Award]] for \"Worst 'Musical' of Our First 25 Years\" in 2005. This film is often regarded as [[List of films considered the worst#From Justin to Kelly (2003)|one of the worst movies ever made]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Texas]], Kelly Taylor works as a waitress and singer at a bar, where many of the cowboy clientele, including Luke, flirt with her. She is invited by her college classmates Alexa and Kaya to vacation in [[Miami, Florida]] for [[spring break]]. Although she generally finds the usual spring break partying and sexual activities demeaning, she accepts the offer to escape from her miserable job. Meanwhile, [[Pennsylvania]]n college student Justin Bell is also in Miami with his friends Brandon and Eddie running the BR&J [[Promoter (entertainment)|party promoter]] business. Brandon is just interested in one-night stands, while Eddie is a geek who is trying to meet up with his internet girlfriend Lizzie.\n\nWhen Kelly, Alexa, and Kaya arrive they dance at a beach concert (\"The Bounce (The Luv)\"), where Kelly first encounters Justin. Kelly and her friends watch as Justin and Brandon give Eddie dating advice (\"Brandon's Rap\"), but leave when Brandon [[mooning|moons]] them and Brandon is given a ticket by police officer Cutler.\n\nLater, Justin and Kelly look for each other at a party (\"Forever Part of Me\"). They meet in a bathroom, where Kelly draws her phone number on a napkin and tosses it to him, but it misses and it falls in a puddle. Justin asks Alexa for Kelly's number, but she gives him her own number instead and says it's Kelly's. Later that night she texts Justin, pretending to be Kelly, and says she's not interested in him. Meanwhile, Kaya starts seeing a busboy, Carlos, and they visit a [[Salsa music|Salsa]] club together (\"It's Meant to Be\").\n\nThe next day, Alexa signs Kelly up for BR&J's whipped cream [[bikini contest]] so that she can see what kind of person Justin really is. Kelly is initially angry at Justin for participating in such a degrading contest, but they run into each other at a food truck and she agrees to go on a boat ride with him. They bond on the boat (\"Timeless\") and agree to meet at the beach the next night. Meanwhile, Brandon gets a ticket from Cutler for hosting the contest without a permit, and Kaya complains to Carlos' boss about how he's treating him, which results in Carlos being fired.\n\nAlexa texts Justin, pretending to be Kelly and tells him to meet at a bar instead of the beach. Alexa sings about how she is wishing for love (\"Wish Upon a Star\"), and when Justin shows up she tells him that Kelly has a boyfriend back home, and calls Luke and asks him to come to Florida. Eddie continues to look for his online date, but gets beat up by a jock and misses their rendezvous.\n\nLater, Kelly is upset at Justin for not showing up at the beach (\"Madness\"), and Luke shows up and claims Kelly is his girlfriend. Luke and Justin start to fight but agree to settle things with a [[hovercraft]] race. Luke is injured, and Brandon gets a ticket from Cutler for gambling on the race. Justin asks Alexa for advice on how to win Kelly back, but Alexa kisses him, which Kelly sees. Carlos gets angry at Kaya for interfering with his life but later realizes that he should've stood up to his boss sooner, and apologizes to Kaya by arranging a romantic dinner for the two of them in a pool.\n\nAt a bar that night, Kelly picks up Alexa's phone and sees the messages between her and Justin, and Alexa confesses that she was jealous of all the attention Kelly gets from guys. Alexa admits to Justin that she's been trying to keep him and Kelly apart, and arranges for the two to reunite (\"Anytime\"). The next day Justin and Kelly, Kaya and Carlos, Brandon and Cutler, and Eddie and Lizzie dance at a pool party (\"That's the Way (I Like It)\").\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kelly Clarkson]] as Kelly Taylor\n* [[Justin Guarini]] as Justin Bell\n* [[Katherine Bailess]] as Alexa\n* [[Anika Noni Rose]] as Kaya\n* [[Brian Dietzen]] as Eddie\n* [[Greg Siff]] as Brandon\n* Jason Yribar as Carlos\n* Christopher Bryan as Luke\n* Theresa San-Nicholas as Officer Cutler\n* Justin Gorence as Greg\n* [[Kaitlin Riley]] as Ashley\n* [[Marc Macaulay]] as Mr. O'Mara\n* [[Jessica Sutta]] as Bracelet Girl\n* [[Zach Woodlee|Zachary Woodlee]] and [[Robert Hoffman (actor)|Robert Hoffman]] as Featured Dancers\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n''From Justin to Kelly'' was made in about {{frac|2|1|2}} months; three weeks was spent for actor readings of the script (of which revisions were still going on) and rehearsals for dances and singing before the six-week shooting schedule.<ref name = \"Tugend2003\">{{cite web|last=Tugend|first=Alina|date=June 8, 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20210818212242/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-jun-08-ca-q-a8-story.html|archivedate=August 18, 2021|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-jun-08-ca-q-a8-story.html|title=It's no contest|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=August 18, 2021}}</ref> ''American Idol'' competitors [[R.
