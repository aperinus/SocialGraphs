Written by [[Dudley Nichols]] and based on a story by McCarey, the film is about a priest and a nun who, despite their good-natured rivalry, try to save their school from being shut down. The character Father O'Malley had been previously portrayed by Crosby in the 1944 film ''[[Going My Way]]'', for which he won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. The film was produced by Leo McCarey's production company, Rainbow Productions.\n\n==Plot==\nThe unconventional Father Charles \"Chuck\" O'Malley ([[Bing Crosby]]) is assigned to St. Mary's parish, which includes a run-down inner-city school building on the verge of being condemned. O'Malley is to recommend whether or not the school should be closed and the children sent to another school with modern facilities; but the sisters feel that God will provide for them.\n\nThey put their hopes in Horace P. Bogardus ([[Henry Travers]]), a businessman who has constructed a modern building next door to the school which they hope he will donate to them. Father O'Malley and the dedicated but stubborn Sister Superior, Mary Benedict ([[Ingrid Bergman]]), both wish to save the school, but their different views and methods often lead to disagreements. One such involves student Eddie (Dickie Tyler), who is being bullied by another. A more serious one regards the promotion of an eighth-grade student, Patsy ([[Joan Carroll]]) of Syracuse, New York, whom the parish has taken in while her mother attempts to get back on her feet.\n\nSister Benedict contracts [[tuberculosis]] and the physician recommends to Father O'Malley that she be transferred to a dry climate with non-parochial duties, but without telling her the reason. She assumes the transfer is because of her disagreements with O'Malley and struggles to understand the reasons for the path set out for her. Just before Sister Benedict departs, Father O'Malley reveals the true reason for her temporary transfer, and she then leaves happily, looking forward to her return.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:BingCrosbyTheBellsofSaintMarysTrailerScreenshot1945.jpg|thumb|right|Bing Crosby as Father O'Malley]]\n[[File:IngridBergmanTheBellsofSaintMarysTrailerScreenshot1945.jpg|thumb|right|Ingrid Bergman as Sister Benedict]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bing Crosby]] as Father Chuck O'Malley\n* [[Ingrid Bergman]] as Sister Mary Benedict\n* [[Henry Travers]] as Horace P.

It was directed by Tom Donovan.\n\n== Cultural impact ==\n''The Bells of St. Mary's'' has come to be associated with the [[Christmas]] season, probably because of the inclusion of a scene involving a [[Christmas pageant]] at the school, a major plot point involving an unlikely (yet prayed for) gift, and the film's having been released in December 1945.\n\nIn the 1946 film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', in which [[Henry Travers]], a co-star of ''The Bells of St. Mary's'', plays the [[guardian angel]] [[Clarence Odbody]], the title of ''The Bells of St. Mary's'' appears on the marquee of a movie theater in Bedford Falls, New York. In ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972), Michael and Kay see ''The Bells of St. Mary's'' at [[Radio City Music Hall]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Christmas films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|group=N}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* Sarris, Andrew. 1998.
