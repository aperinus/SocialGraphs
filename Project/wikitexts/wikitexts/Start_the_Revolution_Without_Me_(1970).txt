The comedy is set in revolutionary France where two peasants are mistaken for the famous [[The Corsican Brothers|Corsican Brothers]]. The film is considered a [[parody]] of a number of works of historical fiction about the [[French Revolution]] and [[History of France|French history]] in general, including ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (1859) by [[Charles Dickens]] and two works by [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re|Alexandre Dumas]], ''[[The Corsican Brothers]]'' (1844) and ''[[The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later#Part Three: The Man in the Iron Mask (Chapters 181\u2013269)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]'' (1847).\n\n==Plot==\nTwo sets of identical twins are [[babies switched at birth|accidentally switched at birth]]. One pair, Phillipe and Pierre DeSisi, are aristocratic and haughty, while the other, Charles and Claude Coup\u00e9, are poor and dim-witted. On the eve of the French Revolution, both sets find themselves entangled in palace intrigue.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gene Wilder]] as Phillipe/Claude\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Pierre/Charles\n* [[Hugh Griffith]] as [[Louis XVI]]\n* [[Jack MacGowran]] as Jacques\n* [[Billie Whitelaw]] as [[Marie Antoinette]]\n* [[Victor Spinetti]] as Duke d'Escargot\n* [[Ewa Aulin]] as Princess Christina\n* [[Helen Fraser (actress)|Helen Fraser]] as Mimi Montage\n* [[Rosalind Knight]] as Helene de Sisi\n* [[Harry Fowler]] as Marcel\n* [[Murray Melvin]] as Blind Man\n* [[Graham Stark]] as Andre Coupe\n* [[Orson Welles]] as The Narrator\n\n==Reception==\n[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' panned the film, writing: \"The performances are desperate, without being in any way memorable, thus matching the wit of the screenplay.\"<ref>Canby, Vincent (February 5, 1970). [https://books.google.com/books?id=_cxkAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Start+the+Revolution+Without+Me%22 \"'Start the Revolution Without Me' Bows\"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. 31.</ref>\n\nArthur D. Murphy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film \"disappointing,\" finding that \"[t]he final mix never jells, despite some occasional, and genuine, hilarity ... There is a sluggishness and heaviness to some of the direction when the script is in good shape; and when the direction has lightness and zest, the script is in a slump.\"<ref>Murphy, Arthur D. (February 4, 1970). \"Film Reviews: Start The Revolution Without Me\". ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. 18.</ref>\n\n[[Gene Siskel]] gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and declared it \"a terribly funny parody of the over-stuffed 18th century costume dramas that crowd the vaults of many a major studio.\"<ref>Siskel, Gene (May 22, 1970). \"Start the Revolution Without Me\". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 2, p. 13.</ref>\n\n[[Charles Champlin]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' praised the film as \"an absolutely georgeous piece of costume kookery, a dazzling and sustained farce which is also a mad, affectionate tribute to every epee epic, every sabre-and-sex, bodice-and-bodkin historical melodrama anybody ever saw.\"<ref>Champlin, Charles (April 22, 1970). \"Inspired Kind of Spoofery in 'Revolution'\". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Part IV, p. 1.</ref>\n\nGary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that the film \"is not without some oafish and wrong-headed touches, but on the whole it's a witty and engaging picture, an affectionate and competent revival of traditional farce.\"<ref>Arnold, Gary (July 10, 1970). \"Twin Trouble\". ''[[The Washington Post]]''. B12.</ref>\n\nRichard Combs of ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' thought that Sutherland and Wilder \"carry off an assortment of roles in lively fashion,\" but \"the pacing of the film as a whole is unpleasantly jarring.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Combs |first=Richard |date=January 1971 |title=Start the Revolution Without Me |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=38 |issue=444 |page=14 }}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nThe film's screenwriters Fred Freeman and Lawrence J. Cohen were nominated for a [[Writers Guild of America|WGA]] award for Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen in 1971.\n\n[[File:Billie Whitelaw & Hugh Griffith (1970).jpg|thumb|333px|Billie Whitelaw and Hugh Griffith as the king and queen of France]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{IMDb title|0066402}}\n\n{{Bud Yorkin}}\n{{The Corsican Brothers}}\n\n[[Category:1970 films]]\n[[Category:1970s historical comedy films]]\n[[Category:American historical comedy films]]\n[[Category:American parody films]]\n[[Category:French Revolution films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Louis XVI]]\n[[Category:Films about twin brothers]]\n[[Category:Films based on The Corsican Brothers]]\n[[Category:Films based on A Tale of Two Cities]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Bud Yorkin]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Addison]]\n[[Category:Films shot in France]]\n[[Category:Films set in Corsica]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:1970s parody films]]\n[[Category:1970 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]"}]}}}}
