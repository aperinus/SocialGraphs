Directed by [[Robert Z. Leonard]], the screenplay was written by [[Aldous Huxley]] and [[Jane Murfin]], adapted specifically from the stage adaptation by Helen Jerome, in addition to Jane Austen's novel. The story is about five sisters from an English family of [[landed gentry]] who must deal with issues of marriage, morality and misconceptions. The film was released on July 26, 1940 in the United States by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and was critically well received. ''The New York Times'' film critic praised the film as \"the most deliciously pert comedy of old manners, the most crisp and crackling satire in costume that we in this corner can remember ever having seen on the screen.\"<ref name=\"nytimes-review\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nMrs. Bennet ([[Mary Boland]]) and her two eldest daughters, Jane ([[Maureen O'Sullivan]]) and Elizabeth ([[Greer Garson]]), are shopping for new dresses when they notice two gentlemen and a lady arriving outside, exiting from a very expensive carriage. They learn that the men are Mr. Bingley ([[Bruce Lester]]), who has just rented the local estate of Netherfield, and [[Mr. Darcy]] ([[Laurence Olivier]]), both wealthy eligible bachelors, which excites Mrs. Bennet's interest. Collecting her other daughters, Mrs. Bennet returns home, where she tries to convince Mr. Bennet to visit Mr. Bingley, but he declines, explaining to her minutes later that he has already made his acquaintance.\n\nAt the next ball, Elizabeth sees how proud Darcy is when she overhears him refusing to dance with her. Elizabeth also meets Mr. Wickham, who tells her how Darcy did him a terrible wrong. When Darcy does ask Elizabeth to dance with him, she refuses, but when Wickham asks her in front of Darcy, she accepts.\n\nThe Bennets' cousin, Mr. Collins ([[Melville Cooper]]), who will inherit the Bennet estate upon the death of Mr. Bennet, arrives looking for a wife, and decides that Elizabeth will be suitable. Invited to a garden party by Charles Bingley at Netherfield Park, Collins keeps following Elizabeth around, who tries her best to avoid him, as he won't leave her alone. Darcy aids her and directs Collins away. Elizabeth surprisingly outshoots Darcy in archery; later he escorts her to the dance floor, but after seeing questionable behavior of her mother and younger sisters, he leaves her again, making Elizabeth angry with him once more. The next day, Mr. Collins asks her to marry him, but she refuses his persistent proposals. Later, Collins becomes engaged to Elizabeth's best friend, Charlotte Lucas ([[Karen Morley]]).\n\nElizabeth visits Charlotte in her new home. She is introduced to Lady Catherine de Bourgh ([[Edna May Oliver]]), Mr. Collins' \"patroness\", and during her visit she also encounters Mr. Darcy once again. At Charlotte's insistence, Elizabeth sees Darcy who asks her to marry him, but she refuses, partly because of the story Wickham had told her about Darcy, partly because he broke up the romance between Mr. Bingley and Jane, and partly because of his \"character\". They get into a heated argument and he leaves.\n\nWhen Elizabeth returns home, she learns that Lydia has run away with Wickham but they were not married. Mr. Bennet and his brother-in-law unsuccessfully try to find Lydia. Darcy learns of this and returns to offer Elizabeth his services. He tells her that Wickham will never marry Lydia. He reveals that Wickham had tried to elope with his sister, Georgiana, who was younger than Lydia at the time. After Darcy leaves, Elizabeth realizes she loves him but believes he will never see her again.\n\nLydia and Wickham return to the house married. A short time later, Lady Catherine arrives and tells Elizabeth that Darcy found Lydia and forced Wickham to marry her by providing Wickham with a substantial sum of money. She also tells her that she can strip Darcy of his wealth if he marries against her wishes. She demands that Elizabeth promise that she will never become engaged to Darcy. Elizabeth refuses. Lady Catherine leaves in a huff and meets outside with Darcy, who had sent her to see Elizabeth to find out if he would be welcomed by her. After Lady Catherine's report, Darcy comes in and he and Elizabeth proclaim their love for each other in the garden. Mr. Bingley also meets Jane in the garden and takes her hand, all while Mrs. Bennet spies on both couples.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Greer Garson in Pride and Prejudice.JPG|thumb|Garson as Elizabeth Bennet]]\n[[File:Laurence Olivier Pride and prejudice.jpg|thumb|Olivier as Darcy]]\n* [[Greer Garson]] as [[Elizabeth Bennet]]\n* [[Laurence Olivier]] as [[Fitzwilliam Darcy]]\n* [[Mary Boland]] as Mrs. Bennet\n* [[Edna May Oliver]] as Lady Catherine de Bourgh\n* [[Maureen O'Sullivan]] as Jane Bennet\n* [[Ann Rutherford]] as Lydia Bennet\n* [[Frieda Inescort]] as Caroline Bingley\n* [[Edmund Gwenn]] as [[Mr. Bennet (Pride and Prejudice)|Mr. Bennet]]\n* [[Karen Morley]] as Charlotte Lucas Collins\n* [[Heather Angel (actor)|Heather Angel]] as Kitty Bennet\n* [[Marsha Hunt (actress, born 1917)|Marsha Hunt]] as Mary Bennet\n* [[Melville Cooper]] as Mr. Collins\n* [[Edward Ashley-Cooper|Edward Ashley Cooper]] as [[George Wickham]]\n* [[Bruce Lester]] as Mr. Bingley\n* [[E.

In August 1939, MGM had selected [[George Cukor]] to direct the film, with [[Robert Donat]] now cast opposite Shearer.<ref name=\"tcm-notes\" /> The studio considered filming in England, but these plans were changed at the start of the war in Europe in September 1939, which caused the closure of MGM's English operations. Cukor was eventually replaced by Robert Z. Leonard due to a scheduling conflict.<ref name=\"tcm-notes\" />\n\n{{cns|date=March 2022|text=The film differs from the novel in a number of ways. The film's period is later than that of Austen's novel\u2014a change driven by the studio's desire to use more elaborate and flamboyant costumes than those from Austen's time period. Production files show that they conflated the fashions of the 1810s to the 1830s.}}\n\n[[Motion Picture Production Code|The Motion Picture Production Code]] prompted some changes in the film as well. Because Mr. Collins, a ridiculous clergyman in the novel, could not seem to criticize men of the cloth, the character was changed to a librarian.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Looser|first=Devoney|title=The Making of Jane Austen|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2017|page=129|isbn=978-1-4214-2282-4}}</ref> Some scenes were altered significantly. For example, Mr. Wickham was introduced at the beginning of the movie. The archery scene was a figment of the filmmakers\u2019 imagination. In the confrontation between Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Elizabeth Bennet, near the film's end, the former's haughty demand that Elizabeth promise never to marry Darcy was changed to a hoax to test the mettle and sincerity of Elizabeth's love. (In the novel, the confrontation is an authentic demand, motivated by Lady Catherine's snobbery and her ardent desire that Darcy marry her own daughter.)\n\n== Reception ==\nAccording to MGM records, the film earned $1,849,000, resulting in a loss of $241,000, despite the fact that its budget was $1,437,000.<ref name=\"Mannix\" />\n\nThe film was critically well received. [[Bosley Crowther]], reviewing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', described it as \"the most deliciously pert comedy of old manners, the most crisp and crackling satire in costume that we in this corner can remember ever having seen on the screen.\" He also praised the casting, and noted of the two central protagonists:\n{{Blockquote|Greer Garson is Elizabeth\u2014'dear, beautiful Lizzie'\u2014stepped right out of the book, or rather out of one's fondest imagination: poised, graceful, self-contained, witty, spasmodically stubborn and as lovely as a woman can be.

Although the satire is slightly reduced and coarsened and the period advanced in order to use more flamboyant costumes, the spirit is entirely in keeping with Austen's sharp, witty portrait of rural 19th century social mores.\" It continued:<ref name=\"tvguide\">{{cite web |title=Pride and Prejudice |publisher=TV Guide |url=http://movies.tvguide.com/pride-and-prejudice/review/109777 |access-date=August 16, 2014 |archive-date=August 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083241/http://movies.tvguide.com/pride-and-prejudice/review/109777 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n{{Quote|Garson never did anything better than her Elizabeth Bennet.
