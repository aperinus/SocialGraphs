It is inspired by the [[Oscar Wilde]] short story \"[[The Happy Prince and Other Tales#.22The Selfish Giant.22|The Selfish Giant]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.film4.com/reviews/2013/the-selfish-giant |title=The Selfish Giant |work=Film4 |access-date=17 October 2015 |archive-date=15 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715084950/http://www.film4.com/reviews/2013/the-selfish-giant |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nArbor and Swifty are two teenage boys growing up in a poor and run down area of [[Bradford]] in [[West Yorkshire]]. Arbor suffers from hyperactivity disorder, which often gets him into trouble even when it is not his intention. When the boys are suspended from school after a fight, they decide to earn money collecting and selling scrap metal. They quickly realize that stealing copper from telecom, railway, and power utilities can be lucrative.\n\nThey sell their scrap to a local scrap dealer, Kitten, who owns at least two horses and competes in amateur [[harness racing]]. Kitten allows Swifty to work with the horse, once he realizes Swifty's surprising affection for and natural talent with horses. Kitten also lets the boys rent a horse and a cart to collect scrap metal.\n\nArbor is envious of Kitten's kindness toward Swifty. Arbor decides to steal pieces of scrap from Kitten and sell them, along with some other scrap, to a dealer in [[Huddersfield]]. The plan ends up backfiring; Arbor is refused entrance at the other dealer, and when he makes a deal with some men who offer to sell the scrap for him, they recognize it as stolen and keep the money. Kitten finds out and physically intimidates Arbor into stealing a specific piece of high voltage [[electric power transmission]] wire to make up for his loss. The boys are not fully aware of the dangers of high voltage wire. Arbor cuts the wire and Swifty helps to lift it, but is [[electrocuted]] and killed.\n\nArbor is devastated and Kitten is arrested, telling the police he is responsible and allowing Arbor to escape blame. Arbor sits resolutely outside Swifty's mother's house. After several rejections, his own mother finds him and takes him home. He refuses any contact by hiding under his bed, until Swifty\u2019s mother finally comes to him.\n\nIn a final scene, Arbor takes care of the horse Swifty adored.\n\n==Cast==\n* Conner Chapman as Arbor\n* Shaun Thomas as Swifty\n* [[Sean Gilder]] as Kitten\n* [[Lorraine Ashbourne]] as Mary\n* [[Ian Burfield]] as Mick Brazil\n* [[Steve Evets]] as Price Drop Swift\n* [[Siobhan Finneran]] as Mrs. Swift\n* [[Ralph Ineson]] as Johnny Jones\n* Rebecca Manley as Michelle 'Shelly' Fenton\n* Rhys McCoy as Daniel\n* [[Elliott Tittensor]] as Martin Fenton\n\n==Awards and reception==\n''The Selfish Giant'' was screened in the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name=\"Cannes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/readResonnances/59683.html|title=List of films in Cannes Directors' Fortnight|date=24 May 2013|access-date=24 May 2013|work=Cannes|archive-date=22 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922092738/http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/readResonnances/59683.html|url-status=live}}</ref> where it won the Europa Cinemas award.<ref name=\"HWR-DF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-me-myself-mum-takes-558296|title=Cannes: 'Me, Myself and Mum' Takes Home Two Awards From Directors' Fortnight|date=26 May 2013|access-date=26 May 2013|work=Hollywood Reporter|archive-date=9 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609022158/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-me-myself-mum-takes-558296|url-status=live}}</ref> It was also nominated for the 2013 [[Lux Prize]].
