The villagers overhear this and turn to Gisaku, the village elder and [[miller]], who declares that they should hire [[samurai]] to protect them. Since they have no money and can only offer food as payment, Gisaku advises them to find ''hungry'' samurai.\n\nSeveral villagers go into town and eventually find Kambei, an aging but experienced [[r\u014dnin]], whom they see rescuing a young boy held hostage by a cornered thief. A young samurai named Katsushir\u014d asks to become Kambei's disciple. The villagers ask for Kambei's help, and though initially reluctant, he agrees. He then recruits his old comrade-in-arms Shichir\u014dji, along with Gorobei, Heihachi, and Ky\u016bz\u014d, a taciturn master swordsman whom Katsushir\u014d regards with awe. Kikuchiyo, a wild and eccentric r\u014dnin, is also accepted despite attempts to drive him away.\n\nUpon arrival, the samurai find the villagers cowering in their homes, refusing to greet them. Insulted, Kikuchiyo rings the village alarm, prompting the villagers to come out and beg for protection. Slowly, the samurai and farmers learn to trust each other. Katsushir\u014d meets Shino, a farmer's daughter whose father has disguised her as a boy, and becomes intimate despite knowing their different social classes prohibit it. Later, the samurai are angered when Kikuchiyo brings them armor and weapons, which the villagers acquired by killing other samurai injured or fleeing from battle. Kikuchiyo angrily retorts that samurai are responsible for much of the suffering farmers endure, revealing his origin as an orphaned farmer's son. The samurai's anger turns to shame.\n\nKambei arms the villagers with [[bamboo]] spears, and divides them into squads to prepare defences and train. Three bandit scouts are spotted; two are killed, while the survivor reveals the location of their encampment before being slain by the villagers. The samurai burn down the camp in a [[pre-emptive strike]]. Rikichi, a troubled villager aiding the samurai, breaks down when he sees his wife, who was kidnapped and made a [[concubine]] after a previous raid. Upon seeing Rikichi, she runs back into a burning hut to her death. Heihachi is killed by a gun shot while rescuing Rikichi. The saddened villagers are inspired by Kikuchiyo, who raises a [[banner]] Heihachi made to represent the samurai and the village.\n\nWhen the bandits finally arrive, they are confounded by the new fortifications, which include a [[moat]] and high wooden fences. They burn the village's outlying houses, including Gisaku's mill. Gisaku's family tries to save him when he refuses to abandon it, but all perish except a lone baby rescued by Kikuchiyo. The bandits then besiege the village, but many are killed as the defenders thwart every attack, which include [[cavalry]] charges that are allowed through a breach so that they could be ambushed.\n\nThe bandits possess three [[Tanegashima (gun)|matchlock muskets]]. Ky\u016bz\u014d ventures out alone and retrieves one; an envious Kikuchiyo abandons his squad to bring back another. However, Kikuchiyo's absence allows a handful of bandits to infiltrate his post and kill several farmers, and Gorobei is slain defending his position. That night, Kambei predicts that the bandits will make one final assault due to their dwindling numbers. Meanwhile, Katsushir\u014d and Shino's relationship is discovered by her father, who is enraged that her virginity has been taken and beats her. Kambei and the villagers intervene; Shichir\u014dji reasons that such a coupling is normal before battle and that they should be forgiven, but the social shame is irreconcilable.\n\nThe next morning, the defenders allow the remaining bandits to enter the village and then ambush them. As the battle winds down, the bandit chief hides in the women's hut armed with a musket, and shoots Ky\u016bz\u014d dead. An enraged Kikuchiyo charges in and is shot as well, but kills the chief before dying. The remaining outlaws are slain.\n\nIn the aftermath, Kambei, Katsushir\u014d and Shichir\u014dji watch from the funeral mounds of their comrades as the joyful villagers sing whilst planting their new crops. Katsushir\u014d and Shino meet one last time, but their relationship has ended. Kambei reflects to Shichir\u014dji that it is another [[pyrrhic victory]] for the samurai: \"The victory belongs to those peasants.

Later, in the course of his research, he discovered a story about samurai defending farmers. According to actor Toshiro Mifune, the film was originally going to be called ''Six Samurai'', with Mifune playing the role of Ky\u016bz\u014d. During the six-week scriptwriting process, Kurosawa and his screenwriters realized that \"six sober samurai were a bore\u2014they needed a character that was more off-the-wall\".<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Toshiro Mifune interview|type=Pamphlet|publisher=Criterion Collection|date=25 August 1993}}</ref> Kurosawa recast Mifune as Kikuchiyo and gave him creative license to improvise actions in his performance.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} During the six-week scriptwriting process, the screenwriters were not allowed visitors or phone calls.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nKurosawa and the writers were innovative in refining the theme of the assembly of heroic characters to perform a mission. According to Michael Jeck's [[Audio commentary (DVD)|DVD commentary]], ''Seven Samurai'' was among the first films to use the now-common [[plot (narrative)|plot element]] of the recruiting and gathering of heroes into a team to accomplish a specific goal, a device used in later films such as ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'', ''[[Sholay]]'', the western remake ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', and Pixar's animated film ''[[A Bug's Life]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lack|first1=Jonathan R.|title=An Appreciation of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai|url=http://www.jonathanlack.com/2012/05/appreciation-of-akira-kurosawas-seven.html|website=Fade to Lack|access-date=20 February 2015}}</ref> Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] speculates in his review that the sequence introducing the leader Kambei (in which the samurai shaves off his topknot, a sign of honor among samurai, in order to pose as a monk to rescue a boy from a kidnapper) could be the origin of the practice, now common in action movies, of introducing the main hero with an undertaking unrelated to the main plot.<ref name=\"StillInterEmpire\">{{cite news|author=Roger Ebert|author-link=Roger Ebert|title=The Seven Samurai (1954)|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=19 Aug 2001|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-seven-samurai-1954|access-date=24 February 2021}}</ref>\n\nOther plot devices such as the reluctant hero, romance between a local woman and the youngest hero, and the nervousness of the common citizenry, had appeared in other films before this but were combined in this film.\n\n===Set design===\nKurosawa refused to shoot the peasant village at Toho Studios and had a complete set constructed at [[Tagata District, Shizuoka|Tagata]] on the [[Izu Peninsula]], [[Shizuoka Prefecture|Shizuoka]]. Although the studio protested the increased production costs, Kurosawa was adamant that \"the quality of the set influences the quality of the actors' performances... For this reason, I have the sets made exactly like the real thing. It restricts the shooting but encourages that feeling of authenticity.\"<ref name=\"robnixon\">{{cite web|last=Nixon|first=Rob|title=Behing [sic] the Camera of the Seven Samurai|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/191474%7C0/Behind-the-Camera-Seven-Samurai.html |access-date=30 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706060910/http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/191474%7C0/Behind-the-Camera-Seven-Samurai.html |archive-date=6 July 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\nHe also spoke of 'intense labour' of making the film: \"It rained all the time, we didn't have enough horses.

[[Toho Studios]] closed down production at least twice. Each time, Kurosawa calmly went fishing, reasoning that the studio had already heavily invested in the production and would allow him to complete the picture. The film's final battle scene, originally scheduled to be shot at the end of summer, was shot in February in near-freezing temperatures. Mifune later recalled that he had never been so cold in his life.<ref name=\"robnixon\" />\n\nThrough the creative freedom provided by the studio, Kurosawa made use of [[telephoto lens]]es, which were rare in 1954, as well as [[Multiple-camera setup|multiple cameras]] which allowed the action to fill the screen and place the audience right in the middle of it.<ref name=\"richiedonald\" /> \"If I had filmed it in the traditional shot-by-shot method, there was no guarantee that any action could be repeated in exactly the same way twice.\" He found it to be very effective and he later used it in movies that were less action-oriented. His method was to put one camera in the most orthodox shooting position, another camera for quick shots and a third camera \"as a kind of [[guerrilla]] unit\". This method made for very complicated shoots, for which Kurosawa choreographed the movement of all three cameras by using diagrams.<ref name=\"robnixon\" />\n\nThe martial arts choreography for the film was led by [[Yoshio Sugino]] of the [[Tenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b]]. Initially Junzo Sasamori of the [[Ono-ha Itto-ryu]] was working along with Sugino, but he was asked by the Ministry of Education to teach in Europe during production.\n\n===Editing===\nDuring filming, Kurosawa quickly earned a reputation with his crew as the \"world's greatest editor\" because of his practice of editing late at night throughout the shooting. He described this as a practical necessity that is incomprehensible to most directors, who on major production spent at least several months with their editors assembling and cutting the film after shooting is completed.<ref name=\"bertcardullo\">{{Cite book\n | last = Cardullo\n | first = Bert\n | title = Akira Kurosawa: Interviews\n | publisher = University Press of Mississippi\n | date = 2008\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=eVs7KxKpWeEC\n | isbn =978-1578069972 }}</ref>{{rp|89}}\n\n===Soundtrack===\nKurosawa had a heightened interest in the soundtracks of his films. For ''The Seven Samurai'', he collaborated for the seventh and penultimate time with friend and composer [[Fumio Hayasaka]]. Hayasaka was already seriously ill when Kurosawa visited him during the filming of the ''Seven Samurai'' and he died prematurely of tuberculosis on October 15, 1955, at the age of 41, while Kurosawa was filming ''[[I Live in Fear]]'', Kurosawa's next film, which Hayasaka was unable to complete.<ref>Larson, Randall. \"The Vintage Score: Seven Samurai\", analysis in Cinemascore: The Film Music Journal.

She noted it was very different from Kurosawa's previous films ''[[Rashomon]]'' (1950) and ''[[Gate of Hell (film)|Gate of Hell]]'' (1953) in that it was \"an action picture\" but that Kurosawa \"has exceeded himself\" with \"The Magnificent Seven.\" She praised Kurosawa's storytelling for \"his deep perception of human nature\" and \"awareness that no two people are alike,\" his \"sensitive, knowing direction\" that \"never lets audiences lose interest\" in the plot development, his talent for making the battle scenes and violent action \"terrifically exciting to audiences\" and his ability to naturally weave humor and romance between the serious action. She also praised the \"inspired performances\" of the cast, including Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune, among other actors.<ref name=\"Daily\" />\n\nMany critics outside of Japan have compared the film to [[Western (genre)|westerns]]. [[Bosley Crowther]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', said the film \"bears cultural comparison with our own popular western ''[[High Noon]]''. That is to say, it is a solid, naturalistic, he-man outdoor action film, wherein the qualities of human strength and weakness are discovered in a crisis taut with peril.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Film historian [[Peter Cowie]] quoted Kurosawa as saying, \"Good westerns are liked by everyone. Since humans are weak, they want to see good people and great heroes. Westerns have been done over and over again, and in the process, a kind of grammar has evolved. I have learned from this grammar of the western.\" Cowie continues this thought by saying, \"That ''Seven Samurai'' can be so seamlessly transposed to an American setting underlines how carefully Kurosawa had assimilated this grammar.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowie |first1=Peter |title=Seven Rode Together: Seven Samurai and the American Western.
