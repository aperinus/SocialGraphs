Directed by [[Byron Haskin]], it stars [[Bobby Driscoll]] as [[Jim Hawkins (character)|Jim Hawkins]] and [[Robert Newton]] as [[Long John Silver]]. ''Treasure Island'' was Disney's first completely live-action film and the first screen version of ''Treasure Island'' made in color. It was filmed in the [[United Kingdom]] on location and at [[Denham Film Studios]], [[Buckinghamshire]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the West Coast of England in 1765, a young boy called [[Jim Hawkins (character)|Jim Hawkins]] lives with his mother in a tiny country inn which they run. [[Billy Bones|Captain William Bones]], a sickly lodger, gives Jim a treasure map after being visited by two pirates, the second of whom gives the captain a note marked with the [[Black Spot (Treasure Island)|black spot]], and sends him for help with a mysterious promise to share. Jim returns with [[Squire Trelawney]] and [[Dr. Livesey (character)|Dr. Livesey]], only to find Bones dead at the inn, and Jim shows Trelawney the map. Trelawney recognizes the map as belonging to the buccaneer Captain Flint and bankrolls a voyage to discover the pirate's lost treasure. Trelawney hires [[Captain Alexander Smollett|Captain Smollett]] and his ship, the ''Hispaniola'', bringing along Dr Livesey as the ship's doctor and Jim as the cabin boy.\n\nBefore departure, Trelawney is taken in by [[Long John Silver]], a one-legged innkeeper, who agrees to gather a crew. Silver strikes up a friendship with Jim and joins the expedition as the ship's cook. Smollett is concerned about the crew, especially because the nature of their journey is common knowledge.\n\nAt sea, Silver convinces Jim to acquire some rum, which he uses to get the first mate, Mr Arrow, drunk so that he is washed overboard in a storm.\n\nJim overhears Silver and the crew's plan to mutiny, discovering that the seamen hired by Silver are Captain Flint's old crew. Jim reveals the treachery to Smollett, who asks Jim to stay friends with Silver to learn more. Upon reaching Treasure Island, Silver offers to tow the ship to a safer anchorage, using two of the ship's rowboats. While the ship is being towed, one of Silver's men, Merry, leads a mutiny on the ship. Smollett, having been warned of the plot by Jim, can hold them off with the few men loyal to him and imprisons the mutineers below decks. Silver cuts the rowboats from the ''Hispaniola'' and heads for shore with the rest of his men, taking Jim as a hostage. Smollett, Trelawney, and Livesey go ashore after them, leaving two guards on the ship.\n\nOn the island, Jim escapes and meets [[Ben Gunn (Treasure Island)|Ben Gunn]], marooned by Flint five years ago. Gunn shows Jim the boat he's built, then leads him to Flint's stockade, where he meets up with Smollett and the others. Meanwhile, Merry escapes, takes the ship and raises the [[Jolly Roger]]. Silver returns to the ''Hispaniola'', arms his men with muskets and makes plans to take the stockade. Short of men, Silver attempts to parlay with Smollett, but when he is rebuffed, Silver calls his men to attack. The assault on the stockade fails, but Silver wounds Smollett. Although seemingly protected by the stockade, Smollett surmises that, with the morning tide, Silver could move the ''Hispaniola'' into cannon range and level the fort.\n\nJim takes Gunn's boat and cuts the ''Hispaniola'''s anchor rope. The pirate [[Israel Hands]] discovers Jim and chases him up into the ship's rigging. Hands injures Jim's arm with a throwing knife but is killed by the boy's pistol. The ''Hispaniola'' runs aground, Jim strikes the Jolly Roger and hoists the Union Jack. Slowed by his wound, which becomes badly infected by swamp water, it takes him all night to get back to the stockade, which is unguarded. Inside, Jim searches for the doctor to tend his wound, but the man asleep under Livesey's coat is Long John Silver. Jim faints on the spot. Silver finds the map on him as his men wake up. Merry wants Jim dead, but Silver states he wants to trade him for the map, which his men believe is with Smollett. The men go outside to vote, pirate-style. From the stockade's lookout, while calling for Livesey, Silver sees that the ship's aground, flying the Union Jack, and believes that Smollett's party has recaptured the ship. The other pirates give Silver the black spot, but he refuses to acknowledge it. Rattled, they let him bargain with Livesey, who has come to treat Jim's infected wound, for the map.\n\nSilver secretly barters with Livesey for leniency in court, inadvertently revealing to him that the ship is no longer under his control. Livesey agrees only when Jim refuses to try and escape with him since Silver saved his life by calling for Livesey. Livesey leaves, and Silver returns with Jim, flaunting the map to convince his men that his bargain was successful. The pirates are overjoyed and take back the black spot, then proceed on a gruelling treasure hunt. When they finally reach the spot where the treasure&nbsp;\u2014 supposed to be 700,000 pounds&nbsp;\u2014 is supposed to be buried, they discover instead an empty pit, save for one guinea. The pirates turn on Silver, who manages to kill three of them before Smollett's men appear to defeat the rest. Greeting Silver, Gunn reveals that he dug up Flint's treasure and has stashed it in a cave. \n \nDespite keeping his end of the bargain, Captain Smollett still wants Silver taken back for trial in England for his mutiny. Hawkins, Trelawney and two others take Silver to the ''Hispaniola'' aboard a rowboat loaded with a few chests of treasure. Silver snatches Jim's pistol and forces Trelawney and the others out of the boat but makes Jim stay to steer him out of the cove. Jim instead beaches him on a sandbar, and Silver orders him to push him off at pistol point, though Jim bravely refuses. Silver is unable to carry out his threat to shoot and drops the pistol in the water, attempting to push the boat off on his own. Seeing Silver struggle, Jim helps him, waving a hesitant farewell as Silver rows away with the treasure and bids him farewell in return.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Bobby Driscoll]] as [[Jim Hawkins (character)|Jim Hawkins]]\n* [[Robert Newton]] as [[Long John Silver]]\n* [[Basil Sydney]] as [[Captain Alexander Smollett|Captain Smollett]]\n* [[Walter Fitzgerald]] as [[Squire Trelawney]]\n* [[Denis O'Dea]] as [[Dr. Livesey (character)|Dr. Livesey]]\n* [[Finlay Currie]] as Capt.

Disney acquired the film rights to the novel from [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], which had been planning on producing its own adaptation, in 1949. Disney decided to film the production in the United Kingdom with financial assistance from RKO so both could use \"frozen\" funds from ticket sales of their films released in Britain, which were required to be spent on film productions in the country.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nExterior scenes were shot in [[Cornwall]] ([[River Fa]]), [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]], [[Carrick Roads]], Gull Rick and [[Helford River]]), [[Devon]] (cliff scenes), [[Bristol]] (wharf), and [[Iver Heath]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]. Interiors were filmed at [[Denham Film Studios]], Denham, Buckinghamshire.

A court in [[Beaconsfield]] fined Driscoll, his father, and Walt Disney Productions \u00a3100 each, and prohibited Driscoll from further work on the film. Still, Disney completed Driscoll's scenes and sent him back to the [[United States]] while his case was under appeal.
