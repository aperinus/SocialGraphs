The film was a major box office success in Japan but is known for having caused a rift between Mifune and Kurosawa, with this being the final collaboration between them after working on 16 films together.

However, for Yasumoto's post-graduate medical training, he is assigned to a rural clinic under the guidance of Dr. Kyoj\u014d Niide, known as ''Akahige'' (\"Red Beard\"). Under a gruff exterior, Dr Niide is a compassionate clinic director.\n\nYasumoto is initially livid at his posting, believing that he has little to gain from working under Red Beard. He assumes that Red Beard is only interested in seeing Yasumoto's medical notes from Nagasaki, and he rebels against the clinic director. He refuses to see patients or to wear his uniform, disdains the food and spartan environment, and enters a forbidden garden where he meets \"The Mantis\", a mysterious patient that only Dr. Niide can treat.\n\nYasumoto's former fianc\u00e9e, Chigusa, had been unfaithful to him, ending their engagement, and generating a disdain in him against relationships. As Yasumoto struggles to come to terms with his situation, the film tells the story of a few of the clinic's patients. One of them is Rokusuke, a dying man whom Dr. Niide discerns is troubled by a secret misery that is only revealed when his desperately unhappy daughter shows up. Another is Sahachi, a well-loved man of the town known for his generosity to his neighbours, who has a tragic connection to a woman whose corpse is discovered after a landslide. Dr Niide brings Yasumoto along to rescue a sick twelve-year-old girl, Otoyo, from a brothel (fighting off a local gang of thugs to do so) and then assigns the girl to Yasumoto as his first patient. Through his efforts to heal the traumatized girl, Yasumoto begins to understand the magnitude of cruelty and suffering around him, as well as his power to ease that suffering, and learns to regret his vanity and selfishness.\n\nWhen Yasumoto himself falls ill, Dr Niide asks Otoyo to nurse him back to health, knowing that caring for Yasumoto will also be part of her own continued healing. Chigusa's younger sister, Masae, visits the clinic to check in on Yasumoto, telling him that his mother wants him to visit. Through his mother, Yasumoto learns that Chigusa now has a child with her new lover. Masae later makes a kimono for Otoyo, showing compassion that suggests she might be a good match for Yasumoto. Yasumoto's mother likes Masae and suggests marriage.\n\nLater, when a local boy, Ch\u00f4ji, is caught stealing food from the clinic, Otoyo shows him compassion and befriends him, passing on the compassion she received from Niide and Yasumoto. When the brothel's madam comes to the clinic to claim Otoyo and take her back to the brothel, the doctors and clinic staff refuse to let Otoyo go and chase the madam away. When Ch\u00f4ji and his destitute family try to escape their misery by taking poison together, the clinic doctors work to save them.\n\nYasumoto is offered the position of personal physician to the Shogunate he had so coveted. He agrees to marry Masae, but at the wedding announces that he will not accept the new position, but will stay at the clinic, turning down a comfortable and prestigious place in society to continue serving the poor alongside Dr. Niide.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Toshiro Mifune]] as Dr. Kyoj\u014d Niide also known as \"Red Beard\", a rough-tempered yet charitable town doctor and [[Japanese martial arts|martial artist]].\n* [[Y\u016bz\u014d Kayama]] as Dr. Noboru Yasumoto\n* [[Tsutomu Yamazaki]] as Sahachi\n* [[Reiko Dan]] as Osugi, a servant.\n* [[:ja:\u6851\u91ce\u307f\u3086\u304d|Miyuki Kuwano]] as Onaka\n* [[Ky\u014dko Kagawa]] as \"The Mantis\", a madwoman.\n* Tatsuyoshi Ehara as Genzo Tsugawa\n* [[Terumi Niki]] as Otoyo\n* [[Akemi Negishi]] as Okuni\n* Yoshitaka Zushi as Choji\n* [[Yoshio Tsuchiya]] as Dr. Handayu Mori\n* [[Eijir\u014d T\u014dno]] as Goheiji\n* [[Takashi Shimura]] as Tokubei Izumiya\n* [[Chish\u016b Ry\u016b]] as Noboru's father\n* [[Kinuyo Tanaka]] as Noboru's mother\n* [[K\u014dji Mitsui]] as Heikichi\n* [[Haruko Sugimura]] as Kin, the madam of a local brothel.\nCast taken from [[The Criterion Collection]].<ref name=\"Criterion\">{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/713-red-beard|title=Red Beard|work=[[The Criterion Collection]]|access-date=April 22, 2022|url-status=live|archive-date=November 24, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124213923/https://www.criterion.com/films/713-red-beard}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nAfter finishing ''[[High and Low (1963 film)|High and Low]]'' (1963), director [[Akira Kurosawa]], accidentally picked up [[Sh\u016bgor\u014d Yamamoto]]'s 1959 novel ''[[:ja:\u8d64\u3072\u3052\u8a3a\u7642\u8b5a|Akahige Shinry\u014dtan]]''.<ref name=\"Richie\">{{cite web |last=Richie |first=Donald |author-link=Donald Richie |date=November 19, 1989 |title=Red Beard |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/922-red-beard |access-date=November 28, 2020 |work=[[The Criterion Collection]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210419162918/https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/922-red-beard |archive-date=April 19, 2021}}</ref> Although he initially believed it would make a good script for fellow director Hiromichi Horikawa, Kurosawa became so interested in it as he wrote, that he knew he would have to direct it himself.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2002|p=374}} Kurosawa completed writing the script for the film in early July 1963, which he co-wrote with screenwriters [[Masato Ide]], [[Hideo Oguni]], and [[Ry\u016bz\u014d Kikushima]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2002|p=374}} Kurosawa noted that the script was quite different from the book, specifically mentioning how the young girl main character was not in Yamamoto's novel.

The wood used for the main gate was over a hundred years old, and after filming, it was re-erected at the entrance to the theater that hosted ''Red Beard''{{'}}s premiere.<ref name=\"Richie\"/>\n\nRichie wrote that one could argue that Kurosawa \"completely wasted his million yen set,\" as the main street is seen for only one minute (although its destruction was incorporated into the earthquake scene). Likewise, the scenes with the bridges and those in the elaborately constructed paddy are also rather brief. However, tourist bus companies did run tours through the set during the two years it took to make ''Red Beard''.<ref name=\"Richie\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Stephen Prince]]'s audio commentary on [[the
