There is an on-screen timer showing the day.  The following is a linear summary of the plot.}}\n\n<!-- [[WP:FILMPLOT]] recommends 400-700 words. As of April 2022 the plot section below was 668 words. -->\nTom Hansen is an aspiring architect who works as a writer at a greeting card company.  One day he meets Summer Finn, a new employee.  They discover that they have a similar taste in music. Later, at a [[karaoke]] night for their work, they talk about love. Tom believes in it, but Summer does not. Tom's friend and co-worker McKenzie drunkenly reveals that Tom likes Summer, which he asserts is only \"as friends\", something Summer agrees with. A few days later, Summer spontaneously kisses Tom in the office. Summer is not looking for a serious relationship. Tom agrees to a [[casual relationship]]. That night they have sex; Tom is elated.\n\nAfter several months of dating, they grow closer. Both Tom's friends and his preteen half-sister Rachel push him to ask Summer where they are in their relationship, though Summer brushes this off, saying that it should not matter if they are both happy. One night, Tom gets into a fight with a man who tries to pick Summer up in a bar, causing their first argument. Later, Summer visits Tom; they make up. Tom asks about their relationship, wanting consistency. Summer says she cannot promise him how she would feel in the future. To show him how she currently feels, she kisses him; they spend the night together.\n\nAfter meeting at a cafe, Tom wants to go back to Summer's but she insists on seeing ''[[The Graduate]]''. She weeps at the ending, surprising him, as he'd always thought it was a romantic fairy tale. Later, at the record store, Summer is distracted, and kisses him good night on the cheek. Tom brings her to a diner, where she lightly announces the relationship is not working, and breaks up with him. Although she still considers Tom her best friend, he is horrified and becomes depressed.\n\nSummer quits the greeting card company. Tom's boss moves him to the consolations department, as his depression is making him unsuitable for happier events. Tom goes on a [[blind date]] with a woman named Alison. Tom spends the date talking about Summer until Alison leaves exasperated.\n\nMonths later, Tom attends co-worker Millie's wedding and tries to avoid Summer on the train, but she spots him and invites him for coffee. They have a good time at the wedding, dance together, and Summer catches the bouquet. She invites Tom to a party at her apartment, falling asleep on his shoulder on the ride back. He attends the party, hoping to rekindle their relationship, but barely interacts with Summer, spending most of the night drinking alone, until he spots her engagement ring.\n\nTom leaves devastated. Further depressed, he only leaves his apartment for alcohol and junk food. After a few days, he returns to work [[hung over]] and, after an emotional outburst, quits. Rachel, his sister, tells Tom that she does not believe Summer was \"the one\" and that he is only remembering happy memories of the relationship. Tom thinks harder, finally seeing moments of incompatibilities he overlooked, and warning signs he missed on the day of the breakup. One day, Tom finds the energy to get out of bed and rededicates himself to architecture, as Summer had encouraged him to do. He assembles a portfolio, and secures job interviews.\n\nSummer visits Tom at his favorite spot in the city. He tells her he left the office, and notes that she got married, which he cannot comprehend as she never wanted to be someone's girlfriend. Summer says she got married because she felt sure, which she did not with Tom. When he says he was wrong about true love existing, she counters that he was right about it, just wrong about it being with her. She tells him she is glad he is doing well. Tom wishes her happiness.\n\nOn Wednesday, May 23, Tom meets a woman applying for the same job. He finds she shares his favorite spot, and invites her for coffee afterwards. She politely declines, then changes her mind. She reveals her name as Autumn. The day counter then resets to Day 1, becoming brighter than it ever did during the Days of Summer. \n<!-- Do not add references to \"the counter\" -->\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as Tom Hansen, a trained architect who works as a writer at a greeting card company.\n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Summer Finn, assistant to Tom's boss.\n* [[Geoffrey Arend]] as McKenzie, Tom's friend and co-worker at the greeting card company.\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] as Rachel Hansen, Tom's younger half-sister.\n* [[Matthew Gray Gubler]] as Paul, one of Tom's friends.\n* [[Clark Gregg]] as Vance, Tom's boss.\n* Key Williams as Tommy Abraham\n* [[Patricia Belcher]] as Millie\n* [[Rachel Boston]] as Alison, Tom's blind date.\n* [[Minka Kelly]] as Autumn\n* [[Maile Flanagan]] as Rhoda\n* [[Yvette Nicole Brown]] as Vance's New Secretary\n* Olivia Bagg as Young Summer\n* [[Richard McGonagle]] as Narrator\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Writing ===\nThe film is presented as a non-linear narrative.

Neustadter explains that when he met the real girl who inspired the character Summer as a student at the [[London School of Economics]] in 2002, he was rebounding from a bad breakup back home, and promptly fell \"crazily, madly, hopelessly in love\" with the girl who \"returned his kisses but not his ardor.\" The ending of the relationship was \"painfully and unforgettably awful,\" which prompted him to co-write the film with Michael H. Weber. When Neustadter later showed the script to Summer's real life counterpart, she said she related more to the Tom character.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Suck on it, Jenny Beckman \n| url = http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/feature/2009/08/31/500_days_of_bummer \n| work = Salon \n| last = Williams \n| first = Mary Elizabeth \n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090904214950/http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/feature/2009/08/31/500_days_of_bummer/\n| archive-date = September 4, 2009\n| url-status = dead\n| access-date = September 2, 2019\n| df = mdy \n}}</ref> Weber also stated that, \"we've all been in the trenches of love, we've all gone through the highs and lows, so Scott and I felt that the only way to tell this story was to come at it from a completely real place. It was pretty interesting for us because Scott was just going through a break-up and I was in a long-term relationship, so we each brought a totally opposite perspective, living it and not living it, and I think that tension helped to bring out more of the comedy\".<ref name=\"Eva\" />\n\n=== Direction ===\nDirector Marc Webb has described the film as more of a \"[[coming of age]]\" story as opposed to a \"[[romantic comedy|rom-com]]\". He stated, \"We arrive at a different conclusion, for one thing. Plus, most romantic comedies are more loyal to a formula than to emotional truth. It's about happiness, and learning that you'll find it within yourself, rather than in the big blue eyes of the girl in the cubicle down the hall. I wanted to make an unsentimental movie and an uncynical movie. In my mind, I wanted it to be something you could dance to. That's why we put a parenthesis in the title \u2013 it's like a pop song in movie form. It's not a big film. It's not about war or poverty. It's about 500 days in a young guy's relationship, but it's no less deserving of scrutiny. When your heart is first broken, it consumes you. And it's an emotion I wanted to make a movie about, before I forgot how it felt\".<ref name=\"Eva\">{{cite news\n| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/16/500-days-of-summer\n| title='Is there such a thing as \"the one\" \u2013 and what happens if you lose her?\n| work=The Guardian\n| last=Wiseman\n| first=Eva\n| access-date=August 16, 2009\n| location=London\n| date=August 16, 2009\n}}</ref>\nWebb also stated that Deschanel's character, Summer, is based on a [[stock character]] type; \"Yes, Summer is an immature view of a woman. She's Tom's view of a woman. He doesn't see her complexity and the consequence for him is heartbreak. In Tom's eyes, Summer is perfection, but perfection has no depth. Summer's not a girl, she's a phase.\"<ref name=\"Eva\" /> Gordon-Levitt explained that he was drawn to the role of Tom because of his relatability to the character. \"I've had my heart broken before. Truly, truly broken. But when I look back at me in my heartbroken phase, it's pretty hilarious, because it felt so much more extreme than it really was. One of the things I love about ''500 Days of Summer'' is that it doesn't make light of what we go through in romances, but it is honest about it and shows it for what it is, which is often profoundly funny\".<ref name=\"Eva\" />\n\n=== Filming locations ===\n[[File:Bradbury building Los Angeles c2005 01383u crop.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A photograph of a building interior showing stairs climbing up five storeys to the final floor where we can see the glass roof.|The [[Bradbury Building]] in Los Angeles was a filming location.]]\nDavid Ng of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' describes architecture as a star of the film.<ref name=\"DavidNg\" />\nTom is seen reading [[Alain de Botton]]'s ''[[The Architecture of Happiness]]''.\nThe film was originally set in San Francisco but was later moved to Los Angeles and the script rewritten to make better use of the location.<ref name=\"LACurbed\">{{cite web\n| url=http://la.curbed.com/archives/2009/06/tk.php\n| title=Screenwriter explains ''500 Days'' Focus on Architecture, Downtown LA\n| work=Curbed LA\n| last=Gluck\n| first=Marissa\n| date=June 8, 2009\n| access-date=June 8, 2009\n}}\n</ref> Buildings used include the [[Los Angeles Music Center]] (which includes the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]]) and the towers of [[One California Plaza|California Plaza]].<ref name=\"DavidNg\">{{cite news\n| author=David Ng\n| date=June 9, 2009\n| title=Downtown L.A. architecture stars in ''500 Days of Summer''\n| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/06/500-days-of-summer-frank-gehry-architecture-joseph-gordonlevitt-zooey-deschanel.html\n| work=Los Angeles Times\n| access-date=January 8, 2010\n}}</ref>\nThe older [[Fine Arts Building (Los Angeles)|Fine Arts Building]] is featured in the film, in a scene where Tom shows it to Summer and mentions its designers, [[Walker & Eisen|Walker and Eisen]], two of his favorite architects.\n\nChristopher Hawthorne of the ''Los Angeles Times'' describes the film as having \"finely honed sense of taste\" to include the [[Bradbury Building]] where Tom goes for his job interview.<ref name=\"LATimes\">{{cite news |last=Hawthorne |first=Christopher |title=L.A. as filtered by love in ''500 Days of Summer'' |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/arts/la-et-500days-2009jul31,0,3332091.story |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=January 8, 2010 |date=July 31, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=July 30, 2009 |first=Christopher |last=Hawthorne |title=500 Days of architecture |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/07/500-days-of-architecture.html |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=January 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTom's favorite spot in Los Angeles was shot at Angel's Knoll, which became a popular tourist attraction after the film's release.
