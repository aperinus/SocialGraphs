With the baby's arrival, they have decided to move on to \"Chapter Two\" of their marriage, retiring from field assignment in an attempt to give their daughter a normal life. While they enjoy the tourism of the city and their daughter, they are the repeated targets of a low-level mugger called 'Muerte' (Tucci) who they foil with relative ease each time he tries to mug them.\n\nFrank, their former handler from Jeff and Jane's espionage days asks the duo for one more mission in exchange for longer maternity leave and an added bonus to their salary. The two accept and learn that a former Czech Secret Police officer, Novacek whom the Blues had former run-ins before, has acquired an experimental plastic explosive called C-22. Though they cannot extradite Novacek, the two are tasked with re-acquiring the explosive and capturing Novacek. As Jeff and Jane begin looking into the C-22 explosive and those rumored to be connected to Novacek, Lieutenant Sawyer continually follows the Blues; suspecting their motives for being in New Orleans. Though they continually slip through his grasp, the Blues confide in him and his partner Sergeant Halsey why they are there and whom they are looking for.\n\nOne night, a disguised Jane has Muerte contact Novacek after Jeff had planted a tracker on him during another attempted mugging at the zoo. Jeff follows the tracker with Sawyer following close behind. Though Jeff attempts to persuade Sawyer to leave as he's way over his head, Sawyer is adamant about joining him. Jane and their daughter are soon kidnapped by Novacek's minions and brought to her hideout. As Jeff demands Jane be freed, she counters by asking Jane to give up their daughter. Jane tosses a baby-disguised explosive and the group escapes to track down Novacek and the C-22 which is in a salt mine.\n\nJane grapples with Novacek until the latter has the upper hand. With the C-22 in a case nearby, Jeff taunts Novacek and uses a flamethrower near the case; demanding she let Jane go. Jane breaks free and kicks Novacek aside, only for a helicopter to arrive with one of Novacek's former subordinates; ready to take Novacek away. As she boards the helicopter, Novacek is promptly handcuffed and taken away to be extradited by Frank. The Blues celebrate the victory and leave New Orleans by boat but not before Muerte attempts one last mugging. Like before, they kick Muerte off the boat and toss him a life preserver before sailing towards Cuba.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kathleen Turner]] as Jane Blue\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Jefferson Blue\n* [[Fiona Shaw]] as Paulina Novacek\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Muerte\n* [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] as Sgt.

It's kind of fun to watch them dance around on tiptoe instead of creating real characters, but one can't help wondering what the whole enterprise would have been like with a director who knew how to make them play against the material a little.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Undercover Blues - Review by Jane Horwitz |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/undercoverbluespg13horwitz_a09e4f.htm |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=September 10, 1993  |access-date=2017-10-11}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0108442}}\n* {{amg title|51739}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=94410}}\n* {{AFI film|id=59692|title=Undercover Blues}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|undercover_blues}}\n* {{Mojo title|undercoverblues}}\n\n{{Herbert Ross}}\n\n[[Category:1993 films]]\n[[Category:1990s action comedy films]]\n[[Category:American spy comedy films]]\n[[Category:American action comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Herbert Ross]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Orleans]]\n[[Category:Films set in New Orleans]]\n[[Category:1990s spy comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Newman]]\n[[Category:1993 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
