An international co-production between the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and Germany, it was directed by [[Simon West]] and revolves around Lara Croft trying to obtain ancient artifacts in competition with the Illuminati.\n\nThe film was released on June 15, 2001, and received generally negative reviews from critics, although Angelina Jolie was praised for her performance. ''Tomb Raider'' was the highest-grossing film on its opening weekend. A sequel, ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider \u2013 The Cradle of Life]]'', was released in 2003.\n\n==Plot==\nAdventurer [[Lara Croft]] defeats a robot in an Egyptian tomb, revealed to be a training exercise arena in her family manor, where she lives with her technical assistant Bryce and butler Hillary. In [[Venice]], as the first phase of a [[Syzygy (astronomy)|planetary alignment]] begins, the [[Illuminati]] search for a key to rejoin halves of a mysterious artifact, \"the Triangle,\" which must be completed by the final phase, a [[solar eclipse]]. Manfred Powell assures the cabal that the artifact is almost ready, but has no real idea of its location.\n\nLara's father Lord Richard Croft, long missing and presumed dead, appears to her in a dream. Lara awakens to a mysterious ticking, and finds a strange clock hidden inside the manor. On her way to consult a friend of her father's, Wilson, Lara crosses paths with Alex West, an American associate and fellow adventurer. Lara shows Wilson the clock, and he puts her in touch with Powell. Lara shows Powell photographs of the clock, which he claims not to recognize.\n\nThat night, armed commandos invade the house and steal the clock, bringing it to Powell. The next morning, a prearranged letter from Lara's father arrives, explaining that the clock is the key to retrieving the halves of the Triangle of Light, an ancient object with the power to control time. After misuse of its power destroyed an entire city, the Triangle was separated: one half was hidden in a tomb at [[Angkor]] Cambodia, and the other in the ruined city located at [[Ukok Plateau]], Siberia. Her father tasks her to find and destroy both pieces before the Illuminati can exploit the Triangle's power.\n\n[[Image:Temple Facade-Angkor.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Ta Keo]] at [[Angkor]].]]\n\nIn Cambodia, Lara finds Powell, who has hired West, and his commandos already at the temple. West solves part of the temple's puzzle, and Powell prepares to insert the clock at the moment of alignment. Lara, realizing they made a mistake, finds the correct keyhole; with only seconds left, Lara persuades Powell to throw her the clock. She unlocks the first piece of the Triangle, and the statues of the temple come to life and attack the intruders. West, Powell, and his remaining men flee with the clock, leaving Lara to defeat an enormous six-armed guardian statue. She escapes with the first piece; recovering at a Buddhist monastery, she arranges a meeting with Powell.\n\nIn Venice, Powell proposes a partnership to find the Triangle, and informs Lara that her father was a member of the Illuminati, and offers to use the Triangle's power to resurrect him; though reluctant, she agrees to join forces. Lara and Bryce travel with Powell, West, and the leader of the Illuminati to Siberia. Entering the tomb, they discover a giant [[orrery]], which activates as the alignment nears completion. Lara retrieves the second half of the Triangle, and Powell kills the Illuminati's leader to restore the Triangle himself, but the halves will not fuse. Realizing Lara knows the solution, Powell kills West to persuade her to complete the Triangle to restore West's and her father's lives. Lara complies, but seizes the Triangle herself.\n\nIn a \"crossing\" of time, Lara faces her father, who urges her to destroy the Triangle for good rather than save his life. Returning to the tomb, Lara manipulates time to save West and stab Powell, and destroys the Triangle. The tomb begins to collapse, and all flee but the wounded Powell, who reveals to Lara that he murdered her father. After a hand-to-hand fight, she kills Powell, retrieving her father's pocket watch and escaping the tomb.\n\nBack in her manor, Lara visits her father's memorial and finds that Bryce has reprogrammed the robot, and Hillary presents her with her pistols, which she takes with a smile.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as [[Lara Croft]], a British adventurer and archaeologist\n* [[Iain Glen]] as Manfred Powell, the leader of the Illuminati\n* [[Jon Voight]] as Lord Richard Croft, Lara Croft's father\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as Alex West, a former acquaintance of Lara and rival treasure hunter who teams up with Powell just to earn money\n* [[Noah Taylor]] as Bryce, Lara's Croft's tech expert\n* [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]] as Distinguished Gentleman\n* [[Chris Barrie]] as Hillary, Lara Croft's butler\n* [[Julian Rhind-Tutt]] as Mr. Pimms\n* [[Leslie Phillips]] as Wilson\n* Henry Wyndham as Boothby's Auctioneer\n* [[Olegar Fedoro]] as Russian Commander\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''Tomb Raider'' went through many drafts and several writers, which resulted in production delays. In 1998, writer Brent V. Friedman, who had co-written ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'' the year before, penned an unproduced ''Tomb Raider'' script. Producer and screenwriter [[Steven E. de Souza]], who wrote and directed the 1994 video game film ''[[Street Fighter (1994 film)|Street Fighter]]'', penned an early draft of the ''Tomb Raider'' script in 1999, but it was rejected by Paramount. The final draft of the script was attributed to five writers, including director Simon West. West reverted back to the original writers after he replaced [[Stephen Herek]] as director.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://ew.com/article/2000/03/02/tomb-raider-gearing-summer-2001-theatrical-release/|title= ''Tomb Raider'' is gearing up for a summer 2001 theatrical release|date= March 2, 2000|access-date= April 23, 2022|first= Rebecca|last= Ascher-Walsh|magazine= Entertainment Weekly}}</ref>\n\n===Financing===\n''Lara Croft'' was financed through [[Tele M\u00fcnchen Gruppe]] (TMG), a German [[tax shelter]]. The tax law of Germany allowed investors to take an instant tax deduction even on non-German productions and even if the film has not gone into production. By selling them the copyright for $94 million and then buying it back for $83.8 million, [[Paramount Pictures]] made $10.2 million. The copyright was then sold again to Lombard Bank, a British investment group and a further $12 million was made. However, to qualify for Section 48 tax relief, the production must include some UK filming and British actors, which was acceptable for a film partially set in the United Kingdom. Presales to distributors in Japan, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain made a further $65 million. [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] paid $6.8 million for premium cable television rights. In total, $94 million was put together.<ref>{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9vpfAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA99| title = Pradeep Thakur: ''Angelina Jolie: The World's Most Powerful Celebrity?'', Morrisville (NC) &#91;without date&#93;, p. 99.| isbn = 9788190870597| last1 = Thakur| first1 = Pradeep}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nThe announcement of the film generated significant discussion about who would be cast to play Lara Croft.

I mean, Lara sleeps with knives and doesn't take shit from anybody.

As she explained to ''NY Rock'' in June 2001: \"C'mon, I'm not so flat chested to begin with. When I wear a tight T-shirt, I look a certain way. So it wasn't like we had to completely change me. You know, we just had to enhance me a little. I'm a 36C. Lara, she's a 36D. And in the game, she's a double D, so we took her down some. But we did give her a bit of padding there. For me, it was simply one size. So it was like having a padded bra. But no, I am not flat chested anyway. So we still made it Lara Croft, but we didn't go to any extremes. And Lara doesn't apologize for herself, and for having that, you know, recognizable shape. So I'm not going to apologize for her either.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/2013/05/15/angelina_jolies_most_thrilling_decision_robbing_her_breasts_of_their_cultural_power/|title=Angelina Jolie's most thrilling decision: Robbing her breasts of their cultural power|work=Salon|date=May 15, 2013|access-date = December 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/2001/jolie_int.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011202073359/http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/2001/jolie_int.asp|title=Angelina Jolie On Filling Lara Croft's Shoes and D-size Cups|publisher=NY Rocks|date=June 2001|access-date = December 27, 2017|archive-date=December 2, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe film marked the feature film debut of television actor [[Chris Barrie]], known for his role of Arnold Rimmer in the [[BBC]] science fiction comedy series ''[[Red Dwarf]]''.

West was removed from working on the film in post due to some problems between him and Paramount, however he did return to work on re-shoots. Editor [[Stuart Baird]] was brought in by Paramount to re-edit the entire film. He was well known for coming in at last minute to help movie studios by fixing up their films which went through troubled productions and had problems with earlier cuts. Baird was promised the job of directing ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' by Paramount in exchange for re-editing original 130 minute cut of this film and John Woo's original 210 minute cut of ''[[Mission: Impossible 2]]''. Due to all the work on post production taking longer than anyone thought it would, and how rushed it was, some of the major effects were apparently left unfinished by the time the film was released in theaters. Baird ended up re-editing the film down to 88 minutes. One of the bigger cuts on the film was changing the original score. Originally, [[Nathan McCree]] was hired to compose the score, since he already composed the music for some of Tomb Raider games, but Paramount insisted on more well known movie composer. Greg Hale Jones started to work on the score with Peter Afterman in November 2000, right after production was finished, and [[Danny Elfman]] composed the main theme for the film. Jones later said how once West was fired from the film, his score and Elfman's theme were shelved. [[Michael Kamen]] was then hired and he submitted couple demos, although according to ''Tales From Development Hell'' by David Hughes, Kamen did in fact compose full score which was rejected once the film was re-edited by Baird. [[Graeme Revell]] was then brought in and he had to compose sixty minutes of music inside ten days. Some earlier reports about the film mentioned [[John Powell (film composer)|John Powell]] as one of original choices for composer, and [[Fatboy Slim]] too. [[Jerry Goldsmith]] was also attached to score the film at one point, but he couldn't do it due to problems with his health at the time.<ref>David Hughes - Tales From Development Hell: The Greatest Movies Never Made, Page 231, Interviews with De Souza and Revell; \"de Souza alleges that West went 'many, many millions over budget and two months over schedule, so the minute he turned in his interminable 130-minute cut, Paramount showed him the door. They didn\u2019t even let him in the editing room.' Whether or not this is true \u2014 West was later invited back to direct minor reshoots in London, and provides director's commentary for the DVD \u2014 Paramount brought in Stuart Baird [...] to re-cut the entire movie. 'Stuart Baird has an executive producer credit on the movie,' notes de Souza, 'but all he did was re-cut the movie down to eighty-eight minutes (plus generous head and tail credits).' The studio also rejected the original music score by Michael Kamen (The X-Men), commissioning Pitch Black composer Graeme Revell to produce a new soundtrack \u2014 sixty minutes of music \u2014 in the space of ten days. [...] So rushed were the final stages of post production, that several major effects shots appeared incomplete by the time the film hit theatres.\"</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://moviemusicuk.us/2001/06/15/lara-croft-tomb-raider-graeme-revell/#more-3729|title = LARA CROFT \u2013 TOMB RAIDER \u2013 Graeme Revell|date = June 16, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.movie-wave.net/titles/tomb_raider2.html|title = Silvestri: Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jerrygoldsmithonline.com/spotlight_lost_scores.htm|title = Jerry Goldsmith Online Spotlight the Lost Scores}}</ref>\n\nDespite large amount of film that was cut out, only four deleted scenes, in total seven minutes long, were included as extras on film's DVD and Blu-Ray releases. Trailers for the film do show at least couple more deleted scenes. At the time of movie's release in July 2001, Simon West said in an interview how he already prepared alternate version of the film for DVD release which would include lot of deleted scenes, but this version was never released. Angelina Jolie's nude scenes were also cut out for PG-13 rating. The shower scene for example originally had actual nude shots of Lara, and next scene where she throws her towel away originally showed some rear nudity from her, however according to Jolie she used body double for her nude shots. One of the special features of the film, ''Digging Into Tomb Raider'', shows filming of another deleted scene where Lara is showering but this one takes place in some outside location. Some of the earlier scripts for the film included more scenes focusing on Lara's sex appeal, like Lara flashing her breasts to some villains as distraction ([[Steven E. de Souza]] February 1999 script), using her breasts to crush giant milipede ([[Mike Werb]] & [[Michael Colleary]] November 1999 script), and many similar scenes (reportedly including her showering, bathing, skinny dipping, losing her bikini while fighting some creature...), but probably due to possible rating problems, this was changed and toned down with each new script. Jolie later said how she was disappointed with how Lara's sexual appeal was scaled down, and how she thought Lara wasn't sexy enough in the final film.<ref>David Hughes - Tales From Development Hell: The Greatest Movies Never Made? - Chapter 12; Tomb Raider Chronicles - Why making the leap to the big screen was the toughest challenge Lara Croft had ever faced, Pages 211-235</ref><ref>Lara Croft: Tomb Raider Blu-ray, Digging Into Tomb Raider (29 minutes)</ref><ref>Jeannette Walls, MSNBC Scoop, September 27, 2000</ref><ref>Simon West interview, Empire Magazine, July 2001</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/lara-croft-tomb-raider-angelina-jolie-dissatisfied-movie-character-wasnt-sexy-enough.html/ | title='Lara Croft: Tomb Raider': Angelina Jolie Was Dissatisfied with the Movie Because Her Character Wasn't 'Sexy Enough' | date=March 5, 2022 }}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = ''Lara Croft: Tomb Raider'' \u2013 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Various artists]]\n| released   = June 15, 2001<ref name=\"Amazon.com\"/>\n| genre      = {{hlist|[[Alternative rock]]|[[Electronic music|electronic]]|[[hip hop music|hip hop]]}}\n| length     = {{unbulleted list|69:01|72:14 {{small|(including the additional track)}}}}\n| label      = {{hlist|[[Elektra Records|Elektra]]|[[Warner Music Group|WEA]]<ref name=\"Amazon.com\"/>}}\n| misc       = {{Singles\n| name       = Lara Croft: Tomb Raider \u2013 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| single1    = [[Deep (Nine Inch Nails song)|Deep]]\n| single1date = 2001 {{small|(promotional)}}\n}}\n}}\n\n''Lara Croft: Tomb Raider'' is a 2001 soundtrack album to the film.
