It is based on [[Rebecca Wells]]' 1996 [[Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood|novel of the same name]] and its 1992 [[prequel]] collection of [[Short story|short stories]], ''[[Little Altars Everywhere]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1937 [[Louisiana]], four little girls in the woods at night take a blood oath of loyalty to one another, led by Vivi Abbott, who dubs the group the \"Ya-Ya Sisterhood.\"\n\nIn 1990s [[New York City]], Vivi's eldest daughter, playwright Siddalee \"Sidda\" Walker, gives an interview with a reporter from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', mentioning her unhappy childhood as a major source of inspiration for her work. The reporter sensationalizes Sidda's complaint, implying abuse and deep, dark family secrets. The article upsets Vivi, who calls Sidda and angrily declares that she is dead to her. Vivi cuts Sidda from her will, and Sidda disinvites Vivi from her upcoming wedding to fianc\u00e9 Connor McGill.\n\nStill friends despite the years, the other Ya-Ya Sisters, Caro Benett, Teensy Whitman, and Necie Kelleher, decide to take the matter into their own hands. They kidnap Sidda in New York and take her back to Louisiana, hoping to show her how Vivi's troubled past has caused her present issues, including her fight with Sidda.\n\nAs the Sisters show Sidda Vivi's scrapbook, ''Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'', a series of flashbacks depicts Vivi's turbulent history from her childhood to Sidda's, which include Vivi witnessing racism at Teensy's aunt and uncle's house, being falsely accused of incest with her father Taylor by her bitter and jealous mother Buggy, and losing the love of her life Jack Whitman, Teensy's older brother, to an airplane crash in World War II. Sidda is unmoved in her opinion of Vivi as self-centered and helpless, and is so upset she tells Connor she wants to postpone their wedding. It is revealed that the main source of conflict in Sidda and Vivi's relationship is an incident where Vivi had a nervous breakdown and brutally beat Sidda and her siblings. Unbeknownst to Sidda, Vivi had been prescribed a dangerous dosage of [[antidepressant]] [[Dexamyl]], which caused her erratic behavior; she had to be hospitalized following the incident.\n\nWith this revelation, Sidda finally understands her mother's suffering. Vivi and Sidda reconcile, and Sidda decides that she wants to marry Connor in Louisiana. Vivi and the Sisters induct Sidda into the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Siddalee \"Sidda\" Walker\n** Allison Bertolino as the child Sidda\n* [[Angus Macfadyen]] as Connor McGill\n* [[Ellen Burstyn]] as Viviane Joan \"Vivi\" Abbott Walker\n** [[Ashley Judd]] as young Vivi Abbott-Walker\n** [[Caitlin Wachs]] as the child Vivi Abbott\n* [[James Garner]] as Shepherd James \"Shep\" Walker\n** [[David Lee Smith]] as young Shep\n* [[Maggie Smith]] as Caroline Eliza \"Caro\" Brewer Bennett\n** [[Katy Selverstone]] as young Caro\n** Mary Katherine Weiss as the child Caro\n* [[Fionnula Flanagan]] as Aimee Malissa \"Teensy\" Whitman\n** [[Jacqueline McKenzie]] as young Teensy\n** Alyssa May Gold as the child Teensy \n* [[Shirley Knight]] as Denise Rose \"Necie\" Kelleher Ogden\n** [[Kiersten Warren]] as young Necie\n** Nicki Tschudi as the child Necie\n* [[Matthew Settle]] as Jack Whitman\n* [[Cherry Jones]] as \"Buggy\" Abbott, Vivi's mother\n* [[David Rasche]] as Taylor Abbot, Vivi's father\n* [[Gina McKee]] as Genevieve Whitman, Teensy's mother\n* Mark Joy as Mr. Whitman, Teensy's father\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Divine Secrets'' grossed a domestic total of $69,599,016 and $4,240,224 outside the States, totaling $73,839,240 worldwide.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=yaya.htm |title=Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=July 12, 2016}}</ref>  The film opened at #2 the weekend of its release with $16,167,412 behind ''[[The Sum of All Fears (film)|The Sum of All Fears]]''{{'}}s second weekend.<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2002&wknd=23&p=.htm June 7-9, 2002 Weekend]</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\n''Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'' received a mixed response from film critics.
