It follows a black family that wants a better life away from the city. ''A Raisin in the Sun'' was released by [[Columbia Pictures]] on May 29, 1961.\n\nIn 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nMembers of the Younger family are anticipating a [[life insurance]] check in the amount of $10,000 and each of them has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with the money. Matriarch Lena Younger wants to buy a house to fulfill the dream she shared with her deceased husband. Walter Lee, her son, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store, believing the income would put an end to the family's financial woes. Ruth, Walter's wife, wanting to provide more space and better opportunities for her son Travis, agrees with Lena. Beneatha, Lena's daughter, would like to use the money to pay her medical school tuition.\n\nLena spends $3,500 for a down payment on a house in Clybourne Park, and after being agitated many times by Walter, gives him the remaining $6,500 and tells him to save $3,000 of it for Beneatha's medical school and take the remaining $3,500 for his own investments. Meanwhile, Ruth discovers she is pregnant and, fearing another child will add to the financial pressures, considers having an [[abortion]]. Walter voices no objection, but Lena is strongly against it, saying \"I thought we gave children life, not take it away from them\".\n\nBeneatha rejects her suitor George, believing he is blind to the problems of their race. Her Nigerian classmate Joseph Asagai proposes to her, wanting to take her to Africa with him after they finish school, but she is unsure what to do.\n\nWhen their future neighbors find out the Youngers are moving in, they send Mark Lindner (known as Karl in the play) from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association to offer them money in return for staying away, but they refuse. Meanwhile, Walter loses the insurance money when one of his \"partners\" in the liquor store scheme, Willie Harris, skips town with the money.\n\nDesperate, Walter offers to take Lindner up on his offer to take money to stay out of Clybourne Park, even while his family begs him not to sell away their dignity. When Lindner arrives, Walter has a last-minute change of heart and rejects Lindner's offer. The Youngers eventually move out of their apartment, fulfilling their dream. The future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they believe that they can succeed through optimism, determination, and remaining together as a family.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sidney Poitier]] as Walter Lee Younger\n* [[Ruby Dee]] as Ruth Younger\n* [[Claudia McNeil]] as Lena Younger\n* [[Diana Sands]] as Beneatha Younger\n* Stephen Perry as Travis Younger\n* [[John Fiedler]] as Mark Lindner\n* [[Ivan Dixon]] as Joseph Asagai\n* [[Louis Gossett Jr.]] as George Murchison\n* [[Joel Fluellen]] as Bobo\n* [[Roy Glenn]] as Willie Harris\n* Louis Terrel as Herman\n\n==Awards and reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a 90% rating from 50 reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1017123-raisin_in_the_sun | title=A Raisin in the Sun | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref>\n\nRuby Dee won the [[National Board of Review]] Award for Best Supporting Actress.
