The film was released in the United States on August 16, 2002.\n\nA major critical and box office failure, the film was universally panned by critics and moviegoers alike and is notable for being [[List of biggest box-office bombs|one of the biggest box office bomb]]s in cinematic history.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2080, there is a colony on the Moon called Little America. Businessman, entrepreneur, retired smuggler and ex-convict, Pluto Nash buys a nightclub in an attempt to fulfill his long-time wish and also to prevent the murder of the club's previous owner, and old friend, Anthony Frankowski by mobsters Gino and his nephew, Larry. With the help of his friend Miguel and an android named Bruno, Pluto rebuilds, and cleans it up into a very popular nightclub.\n\nSeven years later in 2087, a young woman named Dina Lake, the daughter of a friend of Pluto's, Nicky Sticks, is stranded on the Moon and tries to earn money for transport back to Earth. Pluto gives her a job as a server. Pluto is accosted by Mogan and Kelp, henchmen of mysterious entrepreneur and businessman Rex Crater, who wants to buy the club. When Pluto refuses, the henchmen use bombs to destroy the club. Pluto, Dina, and Bruno manage to escape.\n\nPluto's friend Rowland, a retired police detective who is a friend of his mother's, learns that Rex Crater has associates linked to human cloning. While Pluto and Dina investigate further, Crater's assassins strike, but Pluto and Dina escape by hijacking a limo driven by a holographic chauffeur, named James.\n\nTheir investigation further links Zoroaster Marucci to Crater. They are again attacked and chased by Crater's henchmen, but they escape and are then rescued by Felix Laranga, a local smuggler who idolizes Pluto Nash. They infiltrate Crater's casino/hotel at Moon Beach.\n\nPluto finally confronts Crater, who reveals himself to be a clone of Pluto. Crater has shot both Marucci and Dr. Runa Pendankin into orbit and established his own criminal enterprise. When Mogan and Kelp arrive, Crater kills them for their incompetence. He and Pluto then fight, with Crater ultimately being thrown through a window to his death.\n\nSometime later, a celebration is held at the rebuilt, renovated Club Pluto with Nash as the owner once again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as Pluto Nash, a successful businessman, a retired smuggler and ex-convict who deals in animals, clothing and drugs.  \n** Murphy also portrays Rex Crater, a criminal entrepreneur & businessman operating out of Moon Beach and Pluto Nash's clone created by Marucci and the geneticist Dr. Runa Pendankin from the DNA taken from Pluto's removed [[Appendix (anatomy)|appendix]] back when Pluto was incarcerated.\n* [[Randy Quaid]] as Bruno, an old, inferior 63 Deluxe model android, Pluto's childhood friend, and smuggling partner.\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Dina Lake, an aspiring singer from [[Salt Lake City]] and daughter of Pluto's old friend Nicky Sticks who is stranded on the moon and asks Pluto for help finding a job to earn money for a ticket back to Earth.\n* [[Jay Mohr]] as Anthony Frankowski / Tony Francis, a former [[Poles|Polish]] singer who owned a washed-up polka club until Pluto bought it and he relocated to Moon Beach.\n* [[Peter Boyle]] as Rowland, a retired police detective with connections to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and an old friend of Pluto and Flura.\n* [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]] as Felix Laranga, a smuggler from [[Puerto Rico]] and fan of Pluto Nash who deals in animals and contraband casino chips and dice.\n* [[Joe Pantoliano]] as Mogan, one of Rex Crater's henchmen.\n* [[James Rebhorn]] as Belcher, Rex Crater's [[personal assistant]] who used to work for Marucci.\n* [[Pam Grier]] as Flura Nash, the mother of Pluto Nash.\n* [[John Cleese]] as James, the holographic [[chauffeur]] of the limousine that Pluto hijacks.\n* [[Burt Young]] as Gino, a mobster that nearly killed Tony Francis through battery acid ingestion.\n* [[Lillo Brancato]] as Larry, a mobster working for Gino.\n* [[Victor Varnado]] as Kelp, one of Rex Crater's henchmen.\n* Alissa Kramer and Heidi Kramer as Gina and Filomina Francis, Tony's cloned wives in which he doesn't care which is the real one.\n* [[Miguel A.

Directors [[Rick Rosenthal]] and [[Peter Faiman]] were attached to the project at different times. Various stars including [[Harrison Ford]] were rumored to have considered doing the film. [[Eddie Murphy]] became attached to the film while it was in development at [[Castle Rock Entertainment]]. The company, which had previously worked with director [[Ron Underwood]] on ''[[City Slickers]]'', sent Underwood the script. Underwood signed on to the film after the release of his movie ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1998 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]''. Different writers were hired to revise the script over a period of several months, but [[Eddie Murphy]] \"kept rejecting the scripts,\" according to Underwood. Murphy asked for a \"straight\" script, like one that would be written for Sylvester Stallone or Harrison Ford, and said that he would \"bring the comedy.\" Underwood delivered this to Murphy but believed that the script still had \"problems\" and hired another writer to continue to work on it during production.<ref name=\"slashfilm\">{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/ron-underwood-interview/|last=Harris|first=Blake|title=How Did This Get Made: A Conversation With Ron Underwood, Director of 'Tremors,' 'City Slickers,' and 'The Adventures of Pluto Nash'|work=[[Slashfilm]]|date=July 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nUnderwood was dissatisfied with the results of the film as he was shooting it. \"I knew we didn\u2019t have the kind of wit and the fun that I would want...I felt that it was not really working fully...But it wasn't very obvious how to correct it.\" He praised the talents of the cast and crew and said that he enjoyed working with Murphy, but said that Murphy \"wasn't feeling that funny, I don't think.\"<ref name=\"slashfilm\" />\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n''The Adventures of Pluto Nash'' was critically panned.
