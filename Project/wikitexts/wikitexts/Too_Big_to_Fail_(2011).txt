The film aired on [[HBO]] on May 23, 2011. It received 11 nominations at the [[63rd Primetime Emmy Awards#Most nominated shows|63rd Primetime Emmy Awards]]; [[Paul Giamatti]]'s portrayal of [[Ben Bernanke]] earned him the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie]] at the [[18th Screen Actors Guild Awards]].\n\n==Plot summary==\n''Too Big to Fail'' chronicles the [[Late-2000s financial crisis#Credit markets and the shadow banking system|2008 financial meltdown]], focusing on the actions of [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Secretary]] [[Henry Paulson]] and [[Ben Bernanke]], Chairman of the [[Federal Reserve System]], to contain the problems during the period of August 2008 to October 13, 2008. The film starts with clips of news reports about the mortgage industry crisis and the forced sale of the troubled [[Bear Stearns]] to [[JPMorgan Chase]], with Fed guarantees.\n\nWith Bear Stearns out of the picture, [[Short (finance)|short sellers]] have turned their attention on [[Lehman Brothers]]. In need of capital, CEO [[Dick Fuld]] reluctantly fires COO Joe Gregory and CFO Erin Callan, naming Bart McDade as the new president and COO. McDade begins to successfully negotiate a deal with Korean investors, hinging on the condition that Lehman's [[Toxic asset|toxic]] real estate is excluded. The deal falls through, however, when Fuld's pride gets the best of him and he tries to coerce the Koreans into accepting the real estate assets.\n\nPaulson is adamant that the government will not subsidize any more acquisitions, but it becomes clear the most promising buyer for Lehman, [[Bank of America]], is uninterested without Fed involvement. Paulson and [[President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] [[Timothy Geithner]] gather the leaders of the biggest banks, including [[Goldman Sachs]] CEO [[Lloyd Blankfein]], [[JPMorgan Chase]] CEO [[Jamie Dimon]], and [[Morgan Stanley]] CEO [[John J. Mack|John Mack]], to convince them to underwrite the deal themselves. During a break in negotiations, another threatened firm, [[Merrill Lynch]], approaches Bank of America to buy them instead, which Paulson tacitly okays. With Bank of America purchasing Merrill Lynch, the only other buyer is British firm [[Barclays]], but their involvement is blocked by [[Financial Services Authority|British banking regulators]]. Lehman collapses and is forced into [[bankruptcy]]. Meanwhile, insurance firm [[AIG]] also begins to fail.\n\nLehman's collapse affects the entire financial market, and the stock market goes into freefall. Blankfein, Mack, and [[General Electric]] CEO [[Jeffrey Immelt]] inform Paulson they are unable to do business, and [[Minister of the Economy, Finances and Industry (France)|French Finance Minister]] [[Christine Lagarde]] warns him that he must not allow AIG to fail, as the crisis is affecting Europe as well. Unlike Lehman, the Treasury rescues AIG with an $85 billion loan.\n\nBernanke argues that the [[United States Congress|Congress]] must pass legislation to authorize any continued intervention by the Fed or the Treasury. With the availability of [[credit (finance)|credit]] drying up, Paulson's plan is to buy the [[toxic assets]] from the banks to take the risk off their books and increase their cash reserves. Bernanke and Paulson lobby Congress, with Bernanke emphasizing the potential of fallout worse than the [[Great Depression]] if they fail to act. The committee of representatives appear close to agreeing, when [[U.S. Senator]] and Presidential candidate [[John McCain]], with great fanfare, announces that he is suspending his campaign and returning to Washington to work on the legislation, polarizing the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] on the issue.  Paulson has to threaten McCain not to interfere and beg the Democrats, led by [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Nancy Pelosi]], not to back away from the negotiations. After a wave of panic and personal haranguing from [[U.S. President|President]] [[George W. Bush]], the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|legislation passes]] on a second attempt and the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP) is created.\n\nPaulson's team realizes that buying toxic assets will take too long, leaving direct capital injections to the banks as their only option to use TARP to get credit flowing again. Along with [[FDIC]] Chair [[Sheila Bair]], Paulson informs the banks that they will receive mandatory capital injections. The banks eventually agree, but Paulson's staff laments that the parties who caused the crisis are being allowed to dictate the terms of how they should use the billions with which they are being bailed out. In private conference, Bernanke and Paulson lament that, although the intent of TARP is for the banks to use the loan money to restore credit for ordinary consumers, the legislation stops short of forcing them to do so.\n\nAn epilogue notes that the banks did not, in fact, use the loan money as intended, but instead returned it at their earliest opportunity, and the stock market still crashed and was followed by a rash of home foreclosures.  Nevertheless, bank mergers continued in the wake of the crisis, and now only ten financial institutions hold 77% of all U.S. banking assets and have been declared [[too big to fail]].\n\n==Cast==\nThe cast includes the following:<ref><!-- order based on following source: -->{{cite web|url= http://www.hbo.com/movies/too-big-to-fail/cast-and-crew.html | title=Too Big to Fail: Cast & Crew | access-date=January 31, 2012| publisher= [[HBO]] |work=HBO Movies}}</ref>\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[William Hurt]] as [[Henry Paulson]] ([[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Secretary]] and former Chairman and CEO, [[Goldman Sachs]])\n* [[Ed Asner|Edward Asner]] as [[Warren Buffett]] (Primary shareholder, Chairman and CEO, [[Berkshire Hathaway]])\n* [[Billy Crudup]] as [[Timothy Geithner]] (President of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]])\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as [[Ben Bernanke]] ([[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]])\n* [[Topher Grace]] as [[Jim Wilkinson (communications)|Jim Wilkinson]] (Chief of Staff, U.S. Treasury Department)\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as [[John Thain]] (Chairman and CEO, [[Merrill Lynch]])\n* [[Cynthia Nixon]] as [[Michele Davis]] (Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Public Relations and Director of Policy Planning)\n* [[Michael O'Keefe]] as [[J.
