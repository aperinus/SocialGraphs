The plot concerns two [[CIA]] agents who are best friends and discover that they are dating the same woman.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|date=October 2021}}\nCIA agent and best friends Franklin \"FDR\" Foster and Tuck Hansen are deployed to [[Hong Kong]] to prevent international criminal Karl Heinrich from acquiring a weapon of mass destruction, but the mission goes awry, resulting in the death of Heinrich's brother, Jonas. Heinrich swears vengeance against them. Upon returning to the United States, their boss, Collins assigns them to desk duty for their protection.\n\nFDR is a womanizer whose cover is a cruise ship captain while Tuck presents himself as a travel agent. Tuck is divorced with a young son, Joe. After attending one of Joe's karate classes, Tuck attempts to rekindle his connection to his family but is rebuffed by his ex-wife Katie. Tuck sees a commercial for online dating and decides to sign himself up. He matches with Lauren Scott, a product-testing executive who is dealing with the recent engagement of her ex-boyfriend. Her best friend, Trish enrolled her in the same online dating website. FDR insists on being Tuck's back-up for the date and hides nearby, but Tuck and Lauren hit it off right away.\n\nShortly thereafter, FDR runs into Lauren at a video store and tries to flirt with her, not knowing she is Tuck's date. She surmises that he's a ladies' man and ignores him. Intrigued, FDR gatecrashes one of Lauren's test groups and coerces her into going on a date with him. FDR and Tuck soon discover that they are seeing the same woman and decide not to tell her that they know each other, not to interfere with each other's dates and not to have sex with her, letting her instead come to a decision between them.\n\nThe date with FDR does not go well at the start, and Lauren storms out of the club FDR takes her to. After arguing with FDR in the street, Lauren sees her ex-boyfriend and his fianc\u00e9e approaching. Desperate, Lauren grabs FDR and kisses him. She lies to her ex that she and FDR are together, as FDR plays along with the ruse. FDR demands that Lauren explain what happened and suggests they grab some dinner at a nearby pizza parlour, where they talk seriously and hit it off. Later, after dating both men a few times Lauren feels guilty about dating both at the same time, but is persuaded by Trish to make the best of the situation until sure who to choose. Lauren gives herself a week to make up her mind.\n\nBoth men bug Lauren's phone so they can spy on her when she is on dates with the other one. They overhear her and tell Trish that she is going to need to have sex with them both to decide which one is the right one. This leads to both men taking steps to ensure she does not sleep with the other. After a few more dates, Lauren and Trish discuss the pros and cons of dating more than one guy, especially since Tuck has told Lauren he loves her. FDR discovers that Heinrich has arrived in town to kill them. He interrupts Tuck's date with Lauren to warn Tuck about Heinrich, but Tuck doesn't believe him. They engage in an extended fight and Lauren discovers that they are best friends. She angrily leaves with Trish but the women are kidnapped by Heinrich and his men, who are pursued by FDR and Tuck.\n\nFDR and Tuck rescue Lauren and Trish after a car chase, and confess that they are not who they say they are. On Lauren's advice, they shoot out the headlights on Heinrich's SUV, deploying the airbags and sending the car rolling out of control towards them all. With Lauren standing directly in the path of the approaching SUV, FDR and Tuck, on opposite sides of the road, urge her to come to their side and she is saved as she ultimately chooses FDR's side, while Heinrich dies when his car rolls off the elevated freeway and crashes below. Lauren has decided to be with FDR and Tuck makes amends with him, as they declare their brotherly love for one another. The car chase is picked up by the news, and Katie and Joe see it. Later, Joe is at his karate lesson with Tuck when Katie comes to pick Joe up. Tuck and Katie re-introduce themselves to each other and she invites him out for a meal as a family.\n\nShortly thereafter, FDR and Tuck go on a mission. They are about to parachute out of a [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|Chinook helicopter]] when FDR reveals that he will be marrying Lauren and asks Tuck to be his best man. He reveals that he had sex with Katie before she met Tuck but no longer feels guilty about it because Tuck had sex with Lauren. Tuck reveals that they did not go all the way and angrily tackles FDR out of the helicopter.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Chris Pine]] as Franklin \"FDR\" Foster, a womaniser who falls in love with Lauren.\n* [[Tom Hardy]] as Tuck Hansen, a divorced single father who also falls for Lauren.\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Lauren Scott, a product-testing executive and the love interest of FDR and Tuck.\n* [[Warren Christie]] as Steve, Lauren's ex-boyfriend.\n* [[Til Schweiger]] as Karl Heinrich, an international criminal who wants revenge on FDR and Tuck.\n* [[Chelsea Handler]] as Trish, Lauren's best friend who encourages her to keep seeing both men.\n* [[John Paul Ruttan]] as Joe, Tuck's young son.\n* [[Abigail Spencer]] as Katie, Tuck's ex-wife.\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as Collins, FDR and Tuck's boss.\n* [[Rosemary Harris]] as Nana Foster, FDR's grandmother who raised him when his parents died \n* [[Jenny Slate]] as Emily, Lauren's assistant.\n* [[Rebel Wilson]] as actress playing Tuck's sister (extended).\n* [[David Koechner]] as actor playing Tuck's father (extended).\n\n== Production ==\nAccording to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', \"the initial script dates back [...] at least about a decade,\" with [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Seth Rogen]], and [[Sam Worthington]] reportedly turning down the lead role.
