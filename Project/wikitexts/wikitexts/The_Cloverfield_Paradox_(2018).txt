J. Abrams]]{{'}}s [[Bad Robot Productions]]. It is the third film in the [[Cloverfield (franchise)|''Cloverfield'' franchise]], following ''[[Cloverfield]]'' (2008) and ''[[10 Cloverfield Lane]]'' (2016). It stars [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]], [[Elizabeth Debicki]], [[Aksel Hennie]], [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]], [[Chris O'Dowd]], [[John Ortiz]], [[David Oyelowo]], and [[Zhang Ziyi]]. It follows an international group of astronauts aboard a [[space station]] who, after using a [[particle accelerator]] to try to solve Earth's [[energy crisis]], must find a way home when the planet seemingly vanishes.\n\nThe film is based on ''God Particle'', a [[spec script]] from Oren Uziel, which had the main plot of the space-station crew but was unconnected to ''Cloverfield''. The script was acquired by [[Paramount Pictures]] and Bad Robot in 2012. It was planned as part of Paramount's low-budget [[Insurge Pictures|InSurge]] distribution label but, following the folding of that label, its production was expanded as a Paramount-distributed film. Only during production did Abrams decide to link the film to ''Cloverfield'', adapting Uziel's screenplay and adding scenes to establish the connection, after the same approach was used to alter ''10 Cloverfield Lane'' from its original script, ''The Cellar''. Abrams saw the particle accelerator accident as a cinematic means for future events to cause changes in the past, narratively linking the ''Cloverfield'' franchise together.\n\nOnce announced as a yet-to-be-named ''Cloverfield'' film in late 2016, the film's release was delayed several times. A surprise trailer aired during [[Super Bowl LII]] on February 4, 2018, advertising the film's final title and its release on [[Netflix]], which had purchased rights for the film from Paramount. The release occurred immediately after the game.<ref name=\"sb\"/> While the unique marketing tactics were praised, the film itself received generally negative reviews, with many considering it the weakest of the ''Cloverfield'' films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2018/02/05/netflix-cloverfield-paradox-reviews/|title=Netflix Cloverfield sequel trashed by critics: 'An unholy mess'|author=James Hibberd|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=February 5, 2018|access-date=February 5, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/the-cloverfield-paradox-wastes-fresh-marketing-on-disappointing-release/|title=The Cloverfield Paradox Wastes Fresh Marketing on Disappointing Release|author=Jean Bentley|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|date=February 5, 2018|access-date=February 5, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2028,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://ign.com/articles/2018/02/06/how-the-cloverfield-paradox-ties-together-the-cloververse |title=How The Cloverfield Paradox Ties Together The Cloververse|first=Jonathan|last=Dornbush|date=February 5, 2018|work=[[IGN]]}}</ref> Earth is suffering from a global energy crisis. The space agencies of the world prepare to test the Shepard [[particle accelerator]] aboard the orbiting Cloverfield Station, which would provide Earth with infinite energy, while conspiracy theorists fear it will create the \"Cloverfield Paradox\", opening portals to [[Parallel universes in fiction|parallel universes]] allowing their horrors to threaten Earth. Among the crew is Ava Hamilton, a British engineer who frets about leaving her husband Michael potentially for years, as their relationship struggles since the loss of their children to a house fire. The crew is rounded out by American commander Kiel, German physicist Ernst Schmidt, Brazilian medical doctor Monk Acosta, Irish engineer Mundy, Russian engineer Volkov, and Chinese engineer Tam.\n\nAfter about two years of unsuccessful attempts to activate the Shepard, the crew achieves a seemingly stable beam, but it overloads and creates a power surge on the station. After restoring basic power, they find that Earth has vanished from view, and the [[gyroscope]] that aids in the station's navigation is missing. As the crew works on repairs, strange events begin to occur, including the discovery (and subsequent rescue) of an unfamiliar woman called Mina Jensen fused with wires inside a wall. Volkov's eyeballs begin moving of their own accord; he begins conversing with his own reflection in a mirror and is compelled to craft a gun using an on-board 3D printer. He uses the gun to threaten the crew, but as he does so he convulses and dies, and the station's worm colony bursts out of him. Jensen tells Hamilton not to trust Schmidt, who Jensen claims to be a spy sent by the German government to keep the Shepard shut down. Mundy's arm gets pulled into a solid wall and is severed clean off, without bleeding or pain. They find the arm roaming of its own volition. When they recognize it is trying to write something, it instructs them to \"cut Volkov open\". Once they do, they find the missing gyroscope. They finally locate Earth and begin restoring their communications, but transmissions state the station was destroyed and fell to Earth two days prior.\n\nThe crew determine the particle beam overload has activated the Cloverfield Paradox, which is the cause of the strange events, and also moved the station to a parallel universe in which Jensen replaced Tam as the station's engineer, Schmidt is a spy, and Hamilton, (though still working on the mission), has remained on Earth, where her children are still alive. Believing the Paradox can be reversed and they can return to their own universe if they reactivate the Shepard, the crew starts making repairs. Tam is trapped in a chamber that floods with water, and then explodes, freezing the water and Tam. Meanwhile, Hamilton decides to return to parallel Earth with Jensen in order to prevent the fire that killed her children. As they prepare, Mundy is killed in an explosion caused by a strange magnetic field, destabilizing part of the Shepard and threatening to tear the whole station apart. Kiel sacrifices himself to save the station, leaving Hamilton in charge.\n\nOn Earth, Michael has woken up to discover a wave of destruction ravaging the planet, witnessing the silhouette of a giant monster in the distance. On his way to offer assistance at the local hospital, he stops to help a young girl named Molly at a dockyard. After finding the hospital was destroyed, he takes her to the underground shelter of a friend and tends to her wounds.\n\nWith the Shepard ready to activate again, Hamilton prepares to leave with Jensen, but Jensen suddenly knocks her out. Jensen kills Monk with Volkov's gun, wounds Schmidt, and insists the station must stay in her universe to keep the Shepard there. Regaining consciousness, Hamilton uses the gun to shoot out a window, ejecting Jensen into space. Hamilton decides to return to their universe with Schmidt and makes a recording she sends to her alternate universe self, with the plans for the Shepard and in which she stresses of the importance of her family. Hamilton and Schmidt reverse the universe shift and use Tam's modifications to finally make the Shepard work. After reporting in, the two eject themselves in an evacuation capsule towards Earth.\n\nMichael learns from mission control of the station's reappearance and his wife's return to Earth, but he lambasts them for returning to Earth in light of the ongoing situation. As the capsule re-enters the Earth's atmosphere, [[Clover (creature)|a giant monster]] bursts through the top of a cloud layer, letting out a roar as the screen cuts to black.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]] as Ava Hamilton, the British communications officer aboard Cloverfield Station and Michael's wife.\n* [[David Oyelowo]] as Jason Kiel, the American commander of the station.\n* [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]] as Ernst Schmidt, a German physicist.\n* [[John Ortiz]] as Monk Acosta, a Brazilian doctor.\n* [[Chris O'Dowd]] as Gordon Mundy, an Irish engineer.\n* [[Aksel Hennie]] as Sasha Volkov, a Russian engineer.\n* [[Zhang Ziyi]] as Ling Tam, a Chinese engineer.\n* [[Elizabeth Debicki]] as Mina Jensen, an Australian engineer from one of the alternate timelines.\n* [[Roger Davies (actor)|Roger Davies]] as Michael Hamilton, Ava's husband.\n* Clover Nee as Molly, a young girl rescued by Michael.\n{{div col end}}\n\nAdditionally, [[Donal Logue]] cameos as Mark Stambler, a conspiracy theorist discussing the \"Cloverfield Paradox\", the brother of Howard Stambler who was the conspiracy theorist portrayed by [[John Goodman]] in ''10 Cloverfield Lane''.<ref name=\"independent easter eggs\"/> [[Suzanne Cryer]], who appeared as Leslie in ''10 Cloverfield Lane'', also appears in a brief cameo role as a newscaster who interviews Stambler.<ref name=\"independent easter eggs\"/> [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Greg Grunberg]], both of whom have frequently worked with Abrams on other films and television series, provide vocal cameos as Radio Voice and Joe, respectively.<ref name=\"independent easter eggs\">{{cite web | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/cloverfield-3-paradox-easter-eggs-cameos-references-netflix-10-cloverfield-lane-links-secrets-things-a8197506.html | title = The Cloverfield Paradox: All the Easter Eggs, cameos and references to other Cloverfield films | first = Jack | last = Shepherd | date = February 7, 2018 | access-date = February 9, 2018 | work = [[The Independent]] }}</ref> Oyelowo and Logue previously portrayed Kiel and Stambler in the film's [[ARG campaign]].\n\n==Production==\n\n===Pre-production===\nThe film was announced in November 2012, under the title ''God Particle'', based on a script by Oren Uziel and to be directed by Julius Onah.
