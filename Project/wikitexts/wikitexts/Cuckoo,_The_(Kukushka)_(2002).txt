It takes place during [[World War II]] from the perspective of opposing [[USSR|Soviet]] and [[Finland|Finnish]] soldiers stranded at a [[Sami people|Sami]] woman's farmhouse.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/11/movies/film-in-review-the-cuckoo.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=1 January 2022 |title=Film in Review; ''The Cuckoo'' |date =11 July 2003 |first=Dave |last=Kehr}}</ref> It received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nIn September 1944, in the final moments [[Continuation War]] against the [[Soviet Union]], Veikko (Ville Haapasalo), a Finnish soldier, is turned in by his German compatriots for being, in their eyes, a would-be [[deserter]]. As a punishment, the young man is placed in shackles, chained to a rock outcrop in a remote [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] forest, left with nothing but a few supplies, a [[Karabiner 98k]] rifle and ammunition - effectively made a forced [[Kamikaze]] ''kukushka'' sniper. To ensure his willingness to fight, they dress him in the uniform of the German [[Waffen-SS]], as Soviet soldiers felt little mercy towards SS men. Days pass, and after several failed attempts, Veikko succeeds in freeing himself and heads for safety, shackles still attached.\n\nMeanwhile, Ivan (Viktor Bychkov), a captain in the [[Red Army]] accused of anti-Soviet correspondence, is arrested by the [[NKVD]] secret police. En route to his court martial, Soviet planes accidentally bomb the vehicle carrying the disgraced captain, killing the driver and Ivan's guard. Veikko, at this stage still chained to the rock, witnesses the bombing through his rifle scope.\n\nNot far away is the farm of Anni ([[Anni-Kristiina Juuso]]), a [[S\u00e1mi people|S\u00e1mi]] reindeer farmer whose husband was taken away together with their whole reindeer herd by Germans four years earlier, never to return. Hungry and alone, the young and resourceful widow locates the bodies of Ivan and his captors while foraging for food. As she begins to bury the dead, Anni discovers that Ivan is still alive, but seriously hurt. She carries him to her wooden hut and nurses him back to health. Meanwhile, Veikko, in search of tools to remove his shackles, stumbles upon Anni\u2019s farm.\n\nComic, and sometimes tragic, misunderstandings soon arise, resulting in a passionate and very human three-way relationship. Unable to communicate with the others and unaware that the war between the USSR and Finland is over, Ivan is convinced that Veikko is a German soldier gone astray. To Ivan, the German uniform the Finnish soldier was forced to wear is further proof. Ivan even refuses to tell his name to Veikko, answering only \"''Poshol ty!''\" (\u00ab\u041f\u043e\u0448\u0451\u043b \u0442\u044b!\u00bb \"Get lost!\") \u2014 as a result, the two others think his name is \"Psholty\". Veikko is unaware of Ivan\u2019s hatred and just wants to cut off his shackles, return home and put the war behind him, but opts to stay on Anni's farm to avoid falling into enemy hands. The earthly and sensuous Anni, who has not been with a man in four years, could not be more delighted with her good fortune, disregarding the language barrier between them.\n\nFor Anni, Veikko and Ivan are not enemies, but just men. An uncommon and touching bond develops, as the three unlikely souls begin a domestic routine of hunting and gathering in preparation for the long Lapp winter. The two men do what they can to contribute to Anni\u2019s well-being. Veikko builds a sauna and Ivan picks mushrooms. Veikko, Ivan and Anni communicate only with gestures. Starved for love and physical touch, Anni seduces young, strapping Veikko, much to the chagrin of jealous middle-aged Ivan.\n\nNot long afterwards a Soviet biplane crashes in the forest near Anni\u2019s hut, spilling leaflets announcing an [[Moscow Armistice|armistice]] between Finland and the USSR. Veikko thinks he can finally return home safely, but Ivan \u2013 who does not understand Finnish \u2013 manages to find a pistol in the wreckage and, still convinced that Veikko is an enemy, shoots him when he seemingly tries to attack Ivan, really only trying to destroy his rifle. When Ivan reads the last line of the leaflet the plane was dropping (written in Russian and instructing Soviet soldiers to allow the Finns to return home unharmed), he realizes that the war is over. Ivan is torn with remorse and, stumbling, carries Veikko back to the farm.\n\nThe nurturing Anni brings Veikko back from the brink of death through a series of ancient Sami magic rituals. With Veikko bedridden, Anni\u2019s needs for companionship and sexual longing draw Ivan into her bed. Gradually, Ivan and Veikko, no longer separated by ethnic hate nor rivalry for the affections of Anni, become friends. As winter arrives and the two men head back to their respective homes in opposite directions, Anni is left behind with memories \u2013and much more\u2013 of her two unlikely comrades in war and peace. In the final scene, she narrates the story to her children, whom she named after their fathers: Veikko and Psholty.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anni-Kristiina Juuso]] \u2014 Anni, Sami woman\n* [[Ville Haapasalo]] \u2014 Veikko, Finnish sniper\n* [[Viktor Bychkov (actor)|Viktor Bychkov]] \u2014 Captain Ivan Kartuzov (\"Psholty\")\n\n==Crew==\n* Director: [[Aleksandr Rogozhkin|Aleksander V.
