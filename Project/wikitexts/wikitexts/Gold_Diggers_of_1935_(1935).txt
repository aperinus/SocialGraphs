[[Wini Shaw|Winifred Shaw]], [[Hugh Herbert]] and [[Glenda Farrell]] are also featured. The songs were written by [[Harry Warren]] (music) and [[Al Dubin]] (lyrics). The film is best known for its famous \"[[Lullaby of Broadway (song)|Lullaby of Broadway]]\" production number. That song (sung by Shaw) also won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]].\n\nThe movie was the fourth in the ''Gold Diggers'' series of films, after the now [[lost film|lost]] silent film ''[[The Gold Diggers (1923 film)|The Gold Diggers]]'' (1923), the partially lost film ''[[Gold Diggers of Broadway]]'' (1929), and ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]'' (1933). The first three films, all financially successful, had all been based on the 1919 play ''[[The Gold Diggers (1919 play)|The Gold Diggers]]''; ''Gold Diggers of 1935'' was the first one based on a wholly original story. It was followed by ''[[Gold Diggers of 1937]]'' and ''[[Gold Diggers in Paris]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the resort of Lake Waxapahachie, the swanky Wentworth Plaza is where the rich all congregate, and where the tips flow like wine.  Handsome Dick Curtis ([[Dick Powell]]) is working his way through medical school as a desk clerk, and when rich, penny-pinching Mrs. Prentiss ([[Alice Brady]]) offers to pay him to escort her daughter Ann ([[Gloria Stuart]]) for the summer, Dick can't say no \u2013 even his fianc\u00e9e, Arline Davis ([[Dorothy Dare]]) thinks he should do it. Mrs. Prentiss wants Ann to marry eccentric middle-aged millionaire T. Mosley Thorpe ([[Hugh Herbert]]), who is a world-renowned expert on [[snuffbox]]es, but Ann has other ideas. Meanwhile, her brother, Humbolt ([[Frank McHugh]]) has a weakness for a pretty face: he has been married and bought out of trouble by his mother several times.\n\nEvery summer, Mrs. Prentiss produces a charity show for the \"Milk Fund\", and this year she hires the flamboyant and conniving Russian dance director Nicolai Nicoleff ([[Adolphe Menjou]]) to direct the show. The parsimonious Mrs. Prentiss wants to spend the least amount possible, but Nicoleff and his set designer Schultz ([[Joseph Cawthorn]]) want to be as extravagant as they can, so they can rake off more money for themselves, and for the hotel manager ([[Grant Mitchell (actor)|Grant Mitchell]]) and the hotel stenographer Betty Hawes ([[Glenda Farrell]]), who's blackmailing the hapless snuffbox fancier Thorpe.\n\nOf course, Dick and Ann fall in love, Humbolt marries Arline, and the show ends up costing Mrs. Prentiss an arm and a leg, but in the end she realizes that having a doctor in the family will save money in the long run.<ref>Green, Stanley (1999) Hollywood Musicals Year by Year (2nd ed.), pub.

It opens with a head shot of singer Wini Shaw against a black background, then the camera pulls back and up, and Shaw's head becomes the Big Apple, New York City.  As everyone rushes off to work, Shaw returns home from her night's carousing and goes to sleep.  When she awakens, that night, we follow her and her beau (Dick Powell) from club to club, with elaborate large cast tap numbers, until she is accidentally pushed off a balcony to her death. The sequence ends with a return to Shaw's head, as she sings the end of the song. Of all the musical numbers Berkeley created in his career, he named this as his personal favorite.<ref name=\"Hollywood\">{{cite book |last1=Hirschhorn |first1=Clive |author-link1=Clive Hirschhorn |title=The Hollywood Musical |edition=2nd |year=1991 |orig-year=1981 |publisher=Portland House |location=New York |isbn=0-517-06035-3 |page=101}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Gold Diggers of 1935'' was in production at Warner Bros.
