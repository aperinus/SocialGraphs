Becoming unemployed, Nishi spends most of his time taking care of his sick wife Miyuki, who has terminal [[leukemia]]. To pay for his wife's care, Nishi borrows money from the ''[[yakuza]]'', but is having difficulty repaying them.\n\nMeanwhile, Horibe, who becomes paralyzed after the incident, experiences a deep [[Mood disorder|depression]] after his wife and daughter leave him. In a conversation with Nishi, Horibe hints he considered committing [[suicide]], while adding that he would like to paint but cannot afford to buy himself the necessary materials. After a botched suicide attempt, Horibe receives art supplies mailed to him by Nishi. He then takes up painting and creates [[Surrealism|surreal]] works of art, and later in a [[pointillist]] style.\n\nNishi buys a second-hand taxi cab and repaints it in police colors. He arms himself with a revolver and robs a bank dressed as a policeman. Using the money, he pays off the ''yakuza'' and gives some to Tanaka's widow. Nishi then leaves with his wife for a road trip. Nakamura learns from Tanaka's widow about the gift and advises her to keep the money. He also learns about the paints for Horibe and soon realizes who committed the robbery. Nakamura and his partner attempt to reach Nishi, eventually tracing his route as he and his wife embark on their trip.\n\nMeanwhile, even though Nishi has paid his debt to them, the ''yakuza'' deduce Nishi committed the robbery and attempt to extort additional money from him. The ''yakuza'' track down and confronts Nishi, but he kills them all in a violent shootout. The next day, Nishi and his wife are at a beach when they are found by Nakamura and his partner. They prepare to arrest Nishi, but Nishi asks Nakamura to spare him a moment of time and lies alongside his wife on the beach. The couple comforts each other before the camera pans away towards the ocean before two gunshots are heard in the distance.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Takeshi Kitano]] as Yoshitaka Nishi \n* [[Kayoko Kishimoto]] as Miyuki, Nishi's wife\n* [[Ren Osugi]] as Horibe\n* [[Susumu Terajima]] as Nakamura\n* [[Tetsu Watanabe]] as Tesuka\n* [[Hakuryu (actor)|Hakuryu]] as Yakuza Hitman\n* [[Yasuei Yakushiji]] as Criminal\n* Taro Itsumi as Kudo\n* [[Kenichi Yajima]] as Doctor\n* Makoto Ashikawa as Tanaka\n* [[Y\u016bko Daike]] as Tanaka's widow\n\n==Production==\nHoribe takes up painting in the [[pointillism|pointillist]] style in order to compensate for his [[paralysis]].
