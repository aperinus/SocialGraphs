When she wants to give rights to the common people, she's opposed by the Council of Mages, led by Profion. They demand that she hand over the scepter. She refuses, and anticipating a conflict, both sides try to get the Rod of Savrille, which would let them control Red dragons.\n\nTeenage thieves Ridley and Snails try to rob the Sumdall magic school. They're caught by a young Mage named Marina, just as Profion's assistant Damodar attacks the library wizard, to get his map to the Rod of Savrille. Marina, Ridley, and Snails escape with the map, and join with a dwarf named Elwood.\n\nThey discover that to enter the tomb with the rod, they need a ruby called the \"Eye of the Dragon.\" Ridley finds it in a deadly maze in the thieves' guild in Antius, but Damodar arrives and captures Marina and the map. The rest of the group escape, and meet the elf Norda, who is working for the Empress. They free Marina and get the map back, although Snails dies in the attempt.\n\nThey get the Rod of Savrille, although Damodar takes it from them and gives it to Profion. He and the other mages fight against the Empress, with dragons on both sides, until Ridley's group kills Damodar, and gets the Rod of Savrille back from Profion. Marina encourages Ridley to use the Rod to bring Profion down, but Ridley, realizing the Rod's power will corrupt him, refuses and destroys it. Then the Empress has a Gold dragon kill Profion.\n\nRidley later visits Snails' grave with Marina, Elwood, and Norda. When he places the Eye of the Dragon on the grave, Snails' name disappears, and the group is transported away to meet Snails.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* [[Justin Whalin]] as Ridley Freeborn, a rogue/thief\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Snails, a rogue/thief\n* [[Zoe McLellan]] as Marina Pretensa, a young mage\n* [[Lee Arenberg]] as Elwood, a dwarf fighter\n* [[Kristen Wilson (actress)|Kristen Wilson]] as Norda, an elven ranger\n* [[Jeremy Irons]] as Mage Profion\n* [[Bruce Payne]] as Damodar\n* [[Thora Birch]] as Empress Savina\n* [[Edward Jewesbury]] as Vildan Vildir \n* [[Richard O'Brien]] as Xilus, leader of a thieves guild\n* [[Tom Baker]] as Halvarth the Elf\n* Robert Miano as Azmath\n* Tomas Havrlik and Stanislav Ondricek as Mages\n* Martin Astles and Matthew O'Toole as Orcs\n* David O'Kelly as Three Eyes\n* Kia Jam, Nicolas Rochette, and David Mandis as thieves\n* Robert Henny as Crimson Brigade \n* Roman Hemala as Council Mage\n* Andrew Blau and Marta Urbanov\u00e1 as elves\n* Jir\u00ed Mach\u00e1cek as Loyalist General \n{{div col end}}\n\n[[Dave Arneson]], the co-creator of the Dungeons & Dragons board game, makes a cameo appearance in deleted scenes.\n\n== Development ==\n=== Background ===\nThe earliest attempt at a feature-length adaptation of a ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' property by the major film industry date to the early 1980s, as there was a strong interest in producing a film based on ''[[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons]]''; [[Gary Gygax]] had several discussions with producers and agents about the idea, and a screenplay by [[James Goldman]] received eyeballs from major studios.
