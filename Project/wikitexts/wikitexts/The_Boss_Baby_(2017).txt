This article is at 697 so do not add to it without removing something first/carefully checking the wordcount.-->\n\nTimothy \"Tim\" Templeton, an imaginative 7-year-old boy, relishes his parents' attention and is horrified when a new baby brother arrives. Boss Baby, whom he first saw arriving in a taxi, clad in suit and tie, and carrying a briefcase, behaves normally around the adults, crying for attention and food and diapers all day and night. However, Tim, quickly growing jealous, sees Baby behaving and talking like an adult whenever his parents aren't looking.\n\nOne day, Baby holds a staff meeting with other toddlers and infants, under the guise of a neighborhood play date. Tim attempts to record them on a cassette tape, but he is spotted and chased by Baby and his cronies. The parents see this as the children playing in the yard. When Baby destroys Tim's stuffed lamb, the latter attempts to slingshot him out a window, but his parents stop him and he accidentally slingshots the tape into the street, on which a car smashes it. Tim is [[Grounding (discipline technique)|grounded]] until he learns to get along with Baby.\n\nLater, Baby makes Tim suck a special pacifier that allows them to see Baby Corp, where babies come from. Most babies go to families, but those unresponsive to tickling are sent to management, where they are given a special [[baby formula]] that allows them to think and behave as adults while remaining young forever. Baby also explains he's on a special mission to discover why the world's love of babies is being threatened lately by love of puppies, and came to the Templetons as Tim's parents work for Puppy Co. Once his mission is done, he will leave. However, the boys overhear Baby's boss threatening to fire him, should he fail. As that would mean Baby would have to stay with the Templetons and grow up, Tim and Baby agree to work together to prevent this from happening.\n\nOn [[Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day|Take Your Kid to Work Day]], the parents take Tim and Baby with them to Puppy Co., where the boys sneak away to investigate. They are captured by Francis, CEO of Puppy Co. Francis reveals he was previously the Boss of Baby Corp, but started to slowly grow up because he was partially [[lactose intolerant|intolerant to the formula]]. He was fired and forced to live with a hillbilly family, but saved his magic pacifier. He steals Baby's formula, intending to use it to make a \"Forever Puppy\" incapable of aging or dying, which will take all love from babies and give him his revenge on BabyCorp.\n\nFrancis whisks Tim's parents away to a conference in Las Vegas, and leaves his brother Eugene to watch the children in the guise of a female nanny. Without the formula, Baby starts to periodically revert to normal infant behavior. The boys, with help from the neighborhood toddlers, escape Eugene and head to Las Vegas, where they find Francis ready to send a rocket of Forever Puppies out into the world. Tim's parents suspect something is wrong when they hear their children, but are locked up underneath the rocket to be burned. Tim and Baby fight Francis on a raised walkway, pretending to be pirates; they knock him into the vat of augmented formula, where he turns back into a baby and is taken home by Eugene. Tim saves his parents, but Baby goes completely infantile and is stranded on the rocket, which is about to launch. Tim sings him a lullaby, and Baby jumps to him and is revived by the formula.\n\nBaby is taken back to Baby Corp and promoted to CEO. Some Baby Corp employees enter Tim's house, where they remove evidence of Baby, and make his parents forget about him while they are sleeping. One of them asks Tim if he would like to forget too, but he declines. Baby and Tim miss each other terribly, and Tim finally invites Baby back, saying if there is only love enough for one of them, Baby can have it all. Realizing that love is something that grows, instead of being split, Baby returns, this time as a normal infant boy named Theodore \"Ted\" Templeton.\n\nYears later, an adult Tim and Ted tell the story to Tim's eldest daughter, who is apprehensive about the arrival of her new baby sister. After the adults leave, the newborn little girl reveals she is a Boss Baby, too, surprising the elder daughter.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Alec Baldwin by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Alec Baldwin promoting the film at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].]]\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Theodore Lindsay \"Ted\" Templeton Jr./The Boss Baby, an infant with the mind of an adult, who works at Baby Corp and gains his intelligence and speaking ability from drinking a \"Secret Baby Formula\".<ref name=THRBaldwinSpacey />\n* [[Miles Bakshi]] as Timothy Leslie \"Tim\" Templeton, Boss Baby's 7-year-old brother.<ref name=\"SFLikeGlenRoss\">{{cite web|last1=Amderton|first1=Ethan|title=DreamWorks Animation's 'The Boss Baby' Is Like an Animated 'Glengarry Glen Ross' for Kids (Comic-Con 2016)|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/boss-baby-comic-con/|website=[[/Film]]|access-date=October 28, 2016|date=July 21, 2016|archive-date=October 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029043651/http://www.slashfilm.com/boss-baby-comic-con/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"THRKimmelKudrowOswalt\" /><ref name=\"VarietyAnnecyBossBaby\">{{cite news|last1=Hopewell|first1=John|last2=Mayorga|first2=Emilio|title=Annecy: Tom McGrath Unveils Alec Baldwin-Starrer 'Boss Baby'|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/annecy-tom-mcgrath-alec-baldwin-boss-baby-1201797075/|access-date=June 18, 2016|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 16, 2016|archive-date=June 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617133144/http://variety.com/2016/film/news/annecy-tom-mcgrath-alec-baldwin-boss-baby-1201797075/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** [[Tobey Maguire]] as Adult Tim, the narrator.<ref name=\"USATSneakPeek\">{{cite news|last1=Alexander|first1=Bryan|title=Sneak peek: Alec Baldwin is 'The Boss Baby'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/10/16/alec-baldwin-boss-baby-sneak-peek-exclusive/92058380/|access-date=October 17, 2016|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 17, 2016|archive-date=October 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017124708/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/10/16/alec-baldwin-boss-baby-sneak-peek-exclusive/92058380/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Jimmy Kimmel]] as Theodore Lindsay \"Ted\" Templeton Sr., Janice's husband and Tim and Ted Jr.'s father.<ref name=\"THRKimmelKudrowOswalt\" />\n* [[Lisa Kudrow]] as Janice Templeton, Ted Sr.'s wife and Tim and Ted Jr.'s mother.<ref name=\"THRKimmelKudrowOswalt\" />\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Francis E.

Having been often present at DreamWorks, McGrath initially asked Bakshi only to provide a temporary voice for Tim to see if the character \"worked\". The producers listened to 30 to 40 children to choose the scratch voice. McGrath explained their decision: \"No one sounded as authentic as Miles did. A lot of child actors are great, but they are over-articulate for their age. Miles was just natural and charming.
