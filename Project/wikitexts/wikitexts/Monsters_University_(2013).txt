Eleven years later, Mike enrolls in the scaring program at Monsters University (MU) and meets classmates [[Randall Boggs]] and [[James P. Sullivan|James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan]]. Abigail Hardscrabble, dean of MU, warns students that anyone who does not pass a final exam at the end of the first semester will have to leave the scaring program.\n\nAs the semester progresses, Mike has already formed a friendship with Randall, while an intense rivalry forms between him, who studies hard to improve himself, and Sulley, who relies only on his natural talent and begins to falter. They both attempt to join a [[fraternity]], but only Sulley is accepted into Roar Omega Roar (ROR), the most prestigious house on campus. At the final exam, a fight between the duo inadvertently destroys Hardscrabble\u2019s prized scream canister. Hardscrabble tests them separately and fails them both, due to Mike being not scary, and Sulley due to his recklessness. They are forced to transfer to a scream canister designing program, much to their dismay.\n\nWanting to prove himself, Mike signs up for the \"Scare Games\" and makes a deal with Hardscrabble on the condition that if his team wins, all of the members will be admitted to the scaring program, otherwise, he will leave MU. Mike joins Oozma Kappa (OK), a fraternity of misfits, but they are one member short of being able to enter the competition. Randall joins ROR instead after being accepted, and Sulley offers to join OK, as it is his only chance to return to scaring, and Mike reluctantly accepts.\n\nOK finishes last in the first round but are saved from elimination after another team is disqualified for cheating. During each of the next three rounds, OK steadily improves due to Mike's knowledge of scaring and the others' unique talents. Despite their progress, they face setbacks and humiliation by rival fraternities, and Hardscrabble questions whether Sulley believes that Mike can be an effective Scarer. Although OK gets a decisive victory over ROR in the final round, Mike discovers afterwards that Sulley had tampered with the simulator settings to guarantee a win for OK, resulting in Mike berating Sulley for it. The other OK members discard their trophy, ashamed of Sulley for ruining their victory by cheating. Sulley meets with Hardscrabble and confesses that he cheated.\n\nOutraged at Sulley's betrayal and still determined to prove that he can become a scarer, Mike breaks into the school's door lab and enters the human world. He emerges in a summer camp cabin full of children but is unable to scare any of them and flees into the woods. With assistance from the OK members, Sulley sneaks through the door and finds Mike; he admits to Mike that he cheated because he was afraid of failing his team. They reconcile and try to return to MU, but find out that Hardscrabble has deactivated the door.\n\nAs human police officers begin to chase Mike and Sulley, Mike realizes that they may be able to power the door from their side. Working together, Mike traps the police officers and Sulley scares them so badly that it manages to power through the door, then return to MU just as it explodes. Mike and Sulley are expelled from MU for their actions, but the remaining OK members are admitted into the scaring program. As Mike and Sulley leave the campus, Hardscrabble admits that they have surprised her and expresses her hope that they will continue to do so in the future. Seeing a \"Help Wanted\" advertisement for job openings at Monsters, Inc., they decide to apply and are hired to work in the mailroom. Sulley and Mike work their way up to different jobs before becoming a scarer and scare assistant, respectively.{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Monsters, Inc]]'' (2001).}}\n\n==Cast==\n<!--If you add voice actors, you must provide official sources or it will be removed.-->\n{{multiple image\n| perrow = 3\n| total_width = 300\n| align = \n| direction = \n| width = \n| image1 = Billy Crystal VF 2012 Shankbone.JPG\n| width1 = 1534\n| caption1 = \n| height1 = 1917\n| image2 = John Goodman by David Shankbone.jpg\n| width2 = 1953\n| caption2 = \n| height2 = 2394\n| image3 = Steve Buscemi 2009 portrait.jpg\n| width3 = 2090\n| height3 = 3133\n| image4 = Helen Mirren 2014.jpg\n| width4 = 607\n| height4 = 770\n| image5 = Nathan Fillion by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| width5 = 2358\n| height5 = 3096\n| image6 = AlfredMolinaByJustinHoch2009.jpg\n| width6 = 320\n| height6 = 472\n| footer = [[Billy Crystal]], [[John Goodman]], and [[Steve Buscemi]] ''(top)'' reprise their roles from ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' while [[Helen Mirren]], [[Nathan Fillion]], and [[Alfred Molina]] ''(bottom)'' play new characters.\n}}\n{{main|List of Monsters, Inc. characters}}\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Billy Crystal]] as Mike Wazowski, the main character\n** Noah Johnston as Young Mike<ref name=\"first-prequel\">{{cite news|last=Trumbore|first=Dave|title=Producer Kori Rae Talks MONSTERS UNIVERSITY, Creating Pixar's First Prequel, Casting Helen Mirren, Crafting John Ratzenberger's Role and More|url= https://collider.com/kori-rae-monsters-university-interview/|access-date=May 10, 2013|publisher=Collider.com|date=May 10, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[John Goodman]] as James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan<ref name = \"EW frat article\">{{cite web|url= http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/08/23/monsters-university-billy-crystal-fraternity-revenge-of-the-nerds/|title='Monsters University': Billy Crystal explains the prequel's 'Revenge of the Nerds' connection|last=Smith|first=Grady|date=August 23, 2012|access-date=October 8, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"SCHOOLED\">{{cite news|url= http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2011/08/13/monsters-inc-prequel-billy-crystal-gets-schooled-by-pixar/|title='Monsters Inc.' prequel: Billy Crystal gets schooled by Pixar|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=March 5, 2012 | date=August 12, 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Randall \u201cRandy\u201d Boggs<ref name=\"2011D23\">{{cite news|last=Eisenberg|first=Eric|title=Monsters University Voice Cast And Plot Details Announced at D23|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Monsters-University-Voice-Cast-And-Plot-Details-Announced-At-D23-26344.html|access-date=March 6, 2012|newspaper=Cinema Blend|date=August 20, 2011|archive-date=June 28, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210628234914/https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Monsters-University-Voice-Cast-And-Plot-Details-Announced-At-D23-26344.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Peter Sohn]] as Scott \"Squishy\" Squibbles, an Oozma Kappa fraternity member<ref name=\"2011D23\"/><ref name=PTCharacters/>\n* [[Joel Murray]] as Don Carlton, a middle-aged returning student and the founding member and president of Oozma Kappa fraternity<ref name=\"2011D23\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Roahrig|first=Maxwell|title=Flixclusive: Joel Murray talks Monsters University|url=http://www.flixist.com/flixclusive-joel-murray-talks-monsters-university-210124.phtml|access-date=May 10, 2012|newspaper=Flixist|date=May 8, 2012|archive-date=February 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203123120/http://www.flixist.com/flixclusive-joel-murray-talks-monsters-university-210124.phtml|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Sean Hayes|Sean P.

In the planning stage of the film, director of photography, Jean-Claude Kalache, asked \"What if we made these lights just work?\" Before the new system, artists had to build reflections and shadows manually, which became increasingly complex as the models and the setups became more technologically advanced. The new lighting system uses [[path tracing]], a technique that imitates the behaviour of the light in the real world; this automatized the process, delivered more realism, produced soft shadows, and let the artist spend more time on models and complex scenes \u2013 some of which contained thousands of light sources.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brandom|first=Russsel|title=Throwing shade: how Pixar changed the way light works for 'Monsters University'|url= https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/21/4446606/how-pixar-changed-the-way-light-works-for-monsters-university|access-date=June 23, 2013|newspaper=The Verge|date=June 21, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Desowitz|first=Bill|title=Shining a New Light on Pixar|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/films/shining-a-new-light-on-pixar|access-date=June 24, 2013|work=Animation World Network|date=May 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFor research, the filmmakers visited several colleges in the U.S., including [[Harvard University]], [[Stanford University]], [[UC Berkeley]], and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], observing college architecture, student life, [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|Greek organizations]], and the teaching methods of professors and faculty.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://kidstvmovies.about.com/od/MonstersUniversity/tp/Monsters-University-Fun-Facts.htm |title=Monsters University \u2013 Fun Facts! |publisher=Kidstvmovies.about.com |date= July 15, 2013 |access-date=August 16, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"eonline.com\">{{cite web|url= http://www.eonline.com/news/432847/monsters-university-5-things-you-should-know-to-be-too-ghoul-for-school |title=Monsters University: 5 Things You Should Know to Be Too Ghoul for School &#124; E!
