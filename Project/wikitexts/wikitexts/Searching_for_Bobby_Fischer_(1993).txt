Starring [[Max Pomeranc]] in his film debut, [[Joe Mantegna]], [[Joan Allen]], [[Ben Kingsley]], and [[Laurence Fishburne]], it is based on the life of [[prodigy (chess)|prodigy]] [[chess]] player [[Joshua Waitzkin]], played by Pomeranc, and adapted from the book of the same name by Joshua's father, [[Fred Waitzkin]]. The film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] in the [[66th Academy Awards]].\n\n== Plot ==\nSeven-year-old [[Josh Waitzkin]] becomes fascinated with the [[chess]] players in [[Washington Square Park]]. Josh's mother, Bonnie, is initially uncomfortable with her young son's interest, as the games in the park are rife with [[Gaming Law|illegal gambling]] and [[Homelessness|homeless]] players, but eventually allows Josh to play a game with a disheveled player for $5. Although Josh loses, Bonnie is amazed that Josh understands the rules of chess, despite having never been taught them. Another park player, Vinnie Livermore, alerts Bonnie to Josh's advanced talent in the game.\n\nJosh's father, Fred, asks to play a game with his son and swiftly defeats him. It emerges, however, that Josh deliberately lost to spare his father's feelings. When Fred prompts Josh to play a rematch honestly, Josh effortlessly defeats him.\n\nA friendship blooms between Josh and Vinnie, who becomes a mentor to Josh. Fred seeks out the services of [[Bruce Pandolfini]] as a formal chess tutor for his son. Bruce takes an immediate liking to Josh, but disapproves of many of the maverick tactics he has adopted from Vinnie's tutelage. In particular, Bruce disapproves of Josh's tendency to bring out his [[Queen (chess)|queen]] too early, and warns Fred that such careless tactics will weaken Josh's performance in organized chess tournaments.\n\nAgainst Bruce's advice, Fred enrolls Josh in a chess tournament. Josh wins; the first in a slew of tournament victories for him. Fred develops an unhealthy obsession with Josh's chess career, causing friction between Fred, Bonnie, and Josh's school teacher. Josh, upset by the changes he has noticed in his father, begins losing tournaments.\n\nAs a remedy, Fred dedicates Josh entirely to Bruce's teaching regimen, and at Bruce's request, Josh is forbidden from playing any more games with Vinnie. Bruce's relationship with Josh grows cold and [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] as Bruce seeks to harden Josh's competitiveness. When Bruce berates Josh by showering him in \"meaningless [[xerox]]es\" of a certificate that Bruce had previously told Josh was a special award, Bonnie kicks Bruce out of the house.\n\nFred and Josh reconcile, with Fred assuring Josh that he loves his son, even if he isn't a chess champion. Josh is allowed to resume playing chess with Vinnie and his enthusiasm for the game returns.\n\nJosh attends the National Chess Championship tournament, where he and Bruce reconcile. In the final game, Josh faces off against Jonathan Poe, another young prodigy whose talent has intimidated Josh throughout the movie. Josh's use of Vinnie's reckless tactics causes him to lose his queen early in the game; however, they later earn him an advantage when he is able to claim Jonathan's queen.\n\nJonathan makes a late-game blunder and Josh draws on Bruce's disciplines to recognize that he can seize an inevitable victory. Instead, Josh offers his opponent a draw. Jonathan, not realizing his own predicament, refuses. The game proceeds and Josh wins.\n\nThe film ends with Fred and Bonnie looking on proudly, as Josh encourages his young friend, Morgan, by telling him: \"You're a much stronger player than I was at your age.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Max Pomeranc]] as [[Josh Waitzkin]]\n* [[Joe Mantegna]] as [[Fred Waitzkin]]\n* [[Joan Allen]] as Bonnie Waitzkin\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Bruce Pandolfini]]\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as \"Vinnie\" Vincent Livermore \u2013 a combination of three African-American park regulars: hustler Vinny Livermore (who died of AIDS in 1992); Poe McClinton, a street-smart expert-strength hustler; and \"Jerry\", a cynical but good-natured old man with a storied past best known for statements like \"All I gotta do is stay black and die\", and likely{{according to whom|date=June 2022}} the one who said \"You've got to risk losing, Josh.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}\n* Michael Nirenberg as Jonathan Poe\n* [[Robert Stephens]] as Jonathan's teacher\n* [[David Paymer]] as Kalev\n* [[Hal Scardino]] as [[Morgan Pehme]]\n* [[Austin Pendleton]] as [[Asa Hoffmann]]\n* Vasek Simek as Russian player\n* [[William H.

[[Chess master]] [[Asa Hoffmann]] is played by [[Austin Pendleton]]; the real Hoffmann did not like the way he was portrayed. Chess expert Poe McClinton, still a park regular, is seen throughout the film. [[Pal Benko]] was supposed to be in the film but his part was cut out. Waitzkin's real mother and sister also have cameos.  [[Bobby Fischer]] appears in newsreel footage.\n\nThe Russian player in the park (played by Vasek Simek) who holds up the sign \"{{smallcaps|Game or Photograf Of Man Who {{sic|Beet}} Tal 1953 \u2022 Five Dollars}}\", was based on the real life of [[Israel Zilber]], who would regularly sleep in the park, awakening only for a \"five dollar game\" that he would demand in a Russian accent (reduced to \"two dollar game\" during slow times if requested) and which he would invariably win.  Zilber also played the [[Queen's Gambit]] as White.<ref>Wall, Bill.

When Sarwer was asked what he felt about his portrayal in the film, he stated: <blockquote>At the end of the day it was a Hollywood film, a work of fiction, and it helped popularize chess more so that's always a good thing.

In September 1985, Josh first played and was defeated by Jeff at the [[Manhattan Chess Club]].
