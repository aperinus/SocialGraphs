Canadian rock band [[Three Days Grace]] made a cameo appearance in the film, performing the songs \"Are You Ready\" and \"[[Home (Three Days Grace song)|Home]]\".\n\n==Plot==\nTerri Fletcher is a [[Flagstaff, Arizona]] teenager who has a passion for singing and dreams of becoming a professional singer. She wants to participate in a music program that could give her a $10,000 scholarship. Her overprotective father Simon, a second-generation restaurateur, disapproves of Terri's plans, stating that being a singer may not be a worthwhile life choice. Simon believes that Terri will get hurt if she goes to [[Los Angeles]] and would prefer if she continues running the family business. Simon thinks this is the only way to keep Terri safe.\n\nTerri is very close to her elder brother Paul, who fully supports her dream, despite their father. At Paul's graduation-day barbecue, he has a fight with Simon, who, in the heat of it, grounds him. That night, Terri sneaks Paul out of the house to attend a [[Three Days Grace]] concert. On the way back, Paul was planning on going to college and leaving right away. They have a car accident, hit by a drunk driver. Terri awakens in the hospital, and learns that Paul was killed.\n\nTerri blames herself for Paul's death, wants to quit singing and not attend the music program. However, her mother Frances says that it's not her fault and that Paul would have wanted Terri to attend the program. She eventually convinces Terri to go, telling Simon that Terri plans to stay with her aunt Nina in [[Palm Desert, California]]<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041007/REVIEWS/40930002 Ebert, Roger (October 8, 2004). \"Raise Your Voice\". ''Chicago Sun-Times'']</ref> for the summer while she actually goes to Los Angeles.\n\nTerri arrives in Los Angeles and has a few difficulties: her jacket is stolen, her cab driver is crabby, and initially can't get into the music school. While in the program, Terri makes new friends, including fun-loving DJ Kiwi, quiet pianist Sloane, and her roommate and talented violinist Denise. Terri learns a great deal about music, but has flashbacks of the car crash.\n\nTerri also develops a mutual fondness for British songwriter Jay, but she faces competition from Robin Childers, who was with Jay the previous summer. Robin still harbors feelings for Jay, but he does not reciprocate. Jay tries to get Robin to leave him and Terri alone. On one occasion, Robin kisses Jay just as Terri walks in. Jay pushes Robin away, but Terri runs off in tears, ignoring Jay's insistence that the kiss meant nothing. Later, finding him drunk, Terri and Denise take Jay to the roof to sober up. When he does, Jay apologizes, and Terri agrees to finish the song they have been working on for the scholarship contest.\n\nIn the meantime, Simon learns of Terri's ruse and becomes furious. He then drives to Los Angeles to bring Terri home. On the final day, Simon comes to the school and Terri finds him packing up her belongings; he reams Terri for deceiving him, and for turning his sister and wife against him. Terri begs her father not to make same mistake he did with Paul and make her run, and not ruin the summer.\n\nUltimately, realizing how selfish he had been, he changes his mind. Terri and Jay perform the song they wrote, dedicating it to Paul. Even though Denise wins the scholarship prize, Simon is proud of his daughter and her talents, and is also glad that her last memory of Paul is one worth having (the concert), as opposed to Simon's own (their argument). Terri's teachers hope to see her next year; Simon replies that they just might. Over the end credits, the students perform together, joyously.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hilary Duff]] as Teresa \"Terri\" Fletcher\n* [[Oliver James (actor)|Oliver James]] as Jay Corgan\n* [[Lauren C.
