The other two were ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces]]'' (1938) and ''[[The Oklahoma Kid]]'' (1939).\n\n== Plot ==\n[[File:Humphrey Bogart James Cagney Jeffrey Lynn in The Roaring Twenties trailer.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney and [[Jeffrey Lynn]]]]\n[[File:The Roaring Twenties 1939 Lobby Card.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Lobby card with James Cagney]]\nEddie Bartlett, George Hally, and Lloyd Hart meet each other in a foxhole during the final days of [[World War I]]. Following the war's end, Lloyd starts his law practice, George becomes a bootlegger, and Eddie becomes a cab driver. While unknowingly delivering a package of liquor to Panama Smith, Eddie is arrested. Panama is acquitted and after a short stint in jail, they go into the [[Bootlegging (business)|bootlegging]] business together. Eddie uses a fleet of cabs to deliver his liquor, and he hires Lloyd as his lawyer to handle his legal issues. He encounters Jean Sherman, a girl he formerly corresponded with during the war, and gets her a job singing in Panama's club. Eddie wants Jean as his wife, giving her an engagement ring that he asks her to hold until he's saved up enough money to quit the criminal rackets.\n\nEddie and his henchmen hijack a shipment of liquor belonging to fellow bootlegger Nick Brown who had refused to cooperate with him. In charge of the liquor shipment is George, who proposes that Eddie bring him in as a partner. Eddie agrees and back home they inform the authorities about one of Brown's liquor shipments. After the shipment is confiscated, Eddie and George raid the warehouse and steal it. As they are leaving, George recognizes one of the watchmen as his former sergeant that he disliked and murders him. After learning of the murder, Lloyd cuts ties with George, who then threatens to kill Lloyd if he informs on them. As the bootlegging rackets prosper, Eddie sends his friend Danny to arrange a truce with Brown, but Danny's corpse is dropped off in front of Panama's club. Eddie goes after Brown, but George, resentful of Eddie's increasing power, tips off Brown, who sets a trap. A gunfight ensues, and Eddie manages to kill Brown. Suspecting George's betrayal but unable to prove it, Eddie dissolves their partnership.\n\nEddie soon discovers that Jean has never really loved him, and is in fact in love with Lloyd. Subsequently, after investing in the stock market, Eddie's bootlegging empire crumbles in the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 crash]], and he is forced to sell his cab company to George at a price far below its value. George mockingly leaves Eddie one cab for himself, stating that Eddie will soon be forced to go back to being a cab driver.\n\nOne day, Jean hails Eddie's cab and he renews his acquaintance with her and with Lloyd, meeting their young son. Lloyd now works at the district attorney's office and is preparing a case against George. The encounter leaves Eddie despondent as he still harbors feelings towards Jean, and he becomes an alcoholic.\n\nWhen Jean discovers that George is planning to have Lloyd killed, she appeals to Eddie for help. He initially declines, but ultimately decides to go to George's house to ask him to have mercy on the couple. While there, Eddie is mocked again by George for his shabby looks. He then decides to have Eddie killed as he believes that Eddie will inform on him in order to help Jean, resulting in a shootout in which Eddie kills George and some of his men.\n\nAfter running outside, Eddie is shot by one of George's men and collapses on the steps of a nearby church. As the police arrest the remainder of George's gang, Panama runs to Eddie and cradles his lifeless body. When a police officer begins inquiring about who Eddie was, she replies, \"He used to be a big shot.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n'''Credited Cast'''\n* [[James Cagney]] as Eddie Bartlett\n* [[Priscilla Lane]] as Jean Sherman\n* [[Humphrey Bogart]] as George Hally\n* [[Gladys George]] as Panama Smith\n* [[Jeffrey Lynn]] as Lloyd Hart\n* [[Frank McHugh]] as Danny Green\n* [[George Meeker]] as Harold Masters\n* [[Paul Kelly (actor)|Paul Kelly]] as Nick Brown\n* [[Elisabeth Risdon]] as Mrs. Sherman\n* [[Edward Keane (actor)|Edward Keane]] as Pete Henderson\n* [[Joseph Sawyer]] as Sergeant Pete Jones\n* [[Abner Biberman]] as Lefty\n* [[John Hamilton (actor)|John Hamilton]] as Judge\n* [[Robert Elliott (actor)|Robert Elliott]] as First Detective\n* [[Eddy Chandler|Eddie Chandler]] as Second Detective\n* [[Vera Lewis]] as Mrs. Gray\n* John Deering as the Narrator\n{{col-break}}\n'''Uncredited Cast'''\n* [[Elliott Sullivan]] as Eddie's Cellmate\n* Patrick H.
