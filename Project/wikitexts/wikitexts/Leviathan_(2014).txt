The town's corrupt Mayor Vadim is plotting legal chicanery to expropriate the beautiful seaside land on which Kolya's house is built. The city is forcefully compensating Kolya with a grossly undervalued sum, and Kolya believes the mayor wants the land to build a villa for himself. Kolya's old friend Dima, a sharp and successful lawyer from Moscow, arrives in town to fight the expropriation through the local court system.\n\nAfter the court rules in favor of the expropriation, Kolya is arrested at the police station for shouting at the officers, and no one in government will accept Dima's new criminal filing against the mayor. However, Dima meets with the mayor, extorting him with a thick folder of incriminating evidence proving his past crimes. A shocked mayor agrees to release Kolya and pay 3.5 million rubles. In a local hotel room, Dima and Lilya have an affair.\n\nThe next day the family and Dima attend the seaside, birthday cookout of Kolya's friend Ivan Stepanich, where a child runs to the group saying that he just saw Dima choking Lilya. Kolya runs to find them. Afterward, Dima and Lilya drive back silent together, both with facial bruises. Meanwhile, Mayor Vadim goes for help to one of his crony bosses, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] bishop, who tells him that all power comes from God and encourages him to stop whining to him and solve his problems forcefully. When Dima next meets with the mayor to finalize the payment, the mayor's thugs beat Dima and the mayor carries out a mock execution, advising him to return to Moscow. A conciliatory Lilya returns home to Kolya, but is depressed. Dima stands sadly looking out the window of a moving train.\n\nWhile the family is packing to move out, Kolya forces himself on Lilya, and Roma accidentally glimpses them in intercourse and flees the house, collapsing in tears by a whale skeleton on the shore. He returns home late, screaming that Lilya leave forever. That night Lilya is unable to sleep, and instead of going to work in the morning, she goes alone to the ocean cliff. When she turns up missing, Kolya desperately searches for her and increases his already very heavy consumption of vodka. Her body is discovered a few days later on the shore. A mournful, drunk Kolya asks the local Orthodox priest why God is doing this to him. The pious priest, quotes from the Biblical book of Job, and counsels Kolya that, when Job accepted his fate, he was rewarded with a long and happy life.\n\nThe next morning Kolya is arrested for murder. The prosecutor claims to have evidence that Kolya had sex with her, killed her with his hammer, and threw her into the sea to hide it. Evidence includes his and Lilya's own friends' testimonies about threats he made to Lilya and Dima when he discovered them having sex at the cookout. Kolya is convicted and sentenced to fifteen years. With no family left, Roma reluctantly agrees to be taken in by Kolya's former friends, to avoid being sent to an orphanage. Mayor Vadim receives a call informing him of Kolya's sentence, and the mayor gloats that Kolya will now know to keep in his place. Kolya's house is torn down. \n\nThe bishop gives a sermon extoling the virtues of God's truth versus the world's truth, and says that good intentions do not excuse evil acts. He urges the congregation, with the mayor attending, not to act with force or cunning, but to put their trust in Christ. The mayor finalizes the plans for a lavish church on Kolya's old property, and he and other local leaders drive away in their luxury European cars.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aleksei Serebryakov (actor)|Aleksei Serebryakov]] as Kolya\n* [[Roman Madyanov]] as Vadim, the mayor\n* [[Vladimir Vdovichenkov]] as Dima, the lawyer friend\n* [[Elena Lyadova]] as Lilya\n* Sergey Pokhodaev as Roma\n* [[Anna Ukolova]] as Anzhela\n* [[Igor Savochkin]] as investigator\n* [[Margarita Shubina]] as Goryunov\u0430,  the prosecutor\n\n==Production==\nWhen [[Andrey Zvyagintsev]] produced a short film in the United States, he was told the story of [[Marvin Heemeyer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rbth.co.uk/arts/2014/10/28/andrey_zvyagintsev_on_art-house_film_spirituality_and_the_rule_of_law_40933.html|title=Andrey Zvyagintsev: On art-house film, spirituality and the rule of law|publisher=RBTH |access-date=8 November 2017}}</ref> He was amazed by this story and wanted initially to make his film in the US, but then changed his mind.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/29/leviathan-russian-cannes-movie-putin-attack|title=Leviathan: the Cannes hit which absolutely definitely doesn't put the boot in to Putin|first=Catherine|last=Shoard|date=29 May 2014 |website=The Guardian |access-date=8 November 2017}}</ref> The screenplay was written by Zvyagintsev and [[Oleg Negin]] and is loosely adapted from the biblical stories of [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] from [[Land of Uz|Uz]] and [[King Ahab]] of [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]] and [[Heinrich von Kleist]]'s novella ''[[Michael Kohlhaas]]''.
