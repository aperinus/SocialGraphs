The film tells the story of a hapless fishtank cleaner who goes into business as a male sex worker in an attempt to earn enough money to repair damage he caused while house-sitting. The film is notable for being the first film produced by [[Happy Madison Productions]].\n\nThe film was released on December 10, 1999 by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]] (through its [[Touchstone Pictures]] label). While the film received negative reviews from critics, it was a box office success, grossing $92 million worldwide on a $17 million budget.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\nA sequel, titled ''[[Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo]]'', was released in 2005 by [[Columbia Pictures]] instead of Touchstone Pictures.\n\n==Plot==\nDeuce Bigalow, an insecure [[aquarist|fishtank cleaner]], is fired for cleaning the tank at a public aquarium while naked. Deuce is unsuccessful in attracting women, so he attempts to keep himself busy at work. On a house call, he meets the Argentinian [[male prostitute]] Antoine Laconte. Antoine is going on a business trip, and so asks Deuce to care for his sick [[lionfish]] and protect his home while he is away. Deuce accidentally sets Antoine's kitchen on fire when trying to make a grilled cheese sandwich in the toaster, and breaks an expensive fish tank, causing a lot of water damage.\n\nFearing Antoine will kill him (Antoine even tells him he will if he messes the place up), Deuce is forced to find a way to pay $6,000 for the damage. Low-rent pimp T.J. Hicks offers to help Deuce make enough money to buy a new fish tank, and convinces Deuce to take over the absent Antoine's role as a gigolo. Deuce decides to make the clients feel better about themselves since he only desires to have sex with beautiful women.\n\nDeuce meets unusual clients but he still manages to get along with them, despite there being no sex involved, by helping them with certain issues in their lives. The clients include Carol, a woman who is severely [[Narcolepsy|narcoleptic]]; Ruth, who has [[Tourette syndrome]] with [[coprolalia]], and therefore is afraid of socializing; Fluisa, an mannish [[Obesity|obese]] woman weighing close to 750 pounds; and Tina, a woman that has a pituitary gland disorder and is extremely tall. Deuce's list of clients gradually increases, with each client being satisfied by much more fulfilling measures due to his personal attention and friendship. However, Deuce falls in love with one of his clients, Kate, who has a [[prosthetic leg]]. She later breaks up with Deuce when she finds out that he was a prostitute hired by her friends.\n\nMeanwhile, Deuce is being stalked by Detective Chuck Fowler, who demands Antoine's \"[[Address book#Little black book|black book]]\" of clients and threatens to take Deuce to jail if he does not comply. Deuce eventually helps Fowler please his wife by stripping and erotically dancing for her, and the two make amends. Deuce is still taken into custody on prostitution charges, as Fowler needs someone to bring in and Deuce refuses to betray his friend T.J. At the hearing, it is revealed that Deuce never slept with any of the clients except for Kate. Since Deuce gave back the money to Kate and was not paid for sex with her, he is cleared of all charges.\n\nUsing the money he made, Deuce restores Antoine's fish tank, although due to time constraints, he is warned that the glass may not be installed properly. Unfortunately, Kate's blind roommate accidentally kills the prize fish in Antoine's aquarium when she starts the mixer in which the fish was being kept. Deuce buys a replacement fish and returns to Antoine's house just before he returns. Antoine taps the new aquarium and the glass shatters. Deuce then reveals his prostituting adventures to the furious Antoine. Enraged, Antoine tries to kill Deuce and at one point shoots a [[crossbow]] bolt at him. Fluisa shows up, comes between the two men, and saves Deuce's life (she is not killed because the bolt hits her breasts, between which she has hidden a roast [[chicken]]). Antoine is then arrested by Detective Fowler and Deuce marries Kate.\n\nThe end sequences then follow. Deuce's father becomes a male prostitute. Fluisa underwent extensive liposuction and became a model in [[Victoria's Secret]] known as Naomi. Ruth opens up an all-girls school for people with Tourette's. Carol manages to fulfill her dream trip to [[France]] and dies falling off the [[Eiffel Tower]]. T.J. starts his own reality show dedicated to his experiences as a male prostitute. An incarcerated Antoine marries Tina.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as Deuce Bigalow, an insecure [[Aquarist|fishtank cleaner]] turned [[gigolo]].\n* [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]] as Detective Charles \"Chuck\" Fowler, an [[LAPD]] detective and Antoine's nemesis.\n* [[Eddie Griffin]] as Tiberius Jefferson \"T.J.\" Hicks, a crazy low-rent [[pimp]] and Deuce's friend.\n* [[Arija Bareikis]] as Kate, a woman with [[prosthetic leg]], one of the Deuce's clients and later his wife.\n* [[Oded Fehr]] as Antoine Laconte, a famous [[gigolo]] from [[Argentina]] and Chuck's nemesis.\n* [[Gail O'Grady]] as Claire\n* [[Richard Riehle]] as Robert \"Bob\" Bigalow, Deuce's dad.\n* [[Jacqueline Obradors]] as Elaine Fowler, Chuck's wife.\n* [[Big Boy (radio host)|Big Boy]] as Fluisa aka Jabba, an [[obese]] woman weighing close to 750 pounds and one of the Deuce's clients.\n* [[Amy Poehler]] as Ruth, a woman who has [[Tourette syndrome]] with [[coprolalia]] and is one of Deuce's clients.\n* Dina Platias as Bergita\n* Deborah Lemen as Carol, a woman with [[narcolepsy]] who is one of Deuce's clients and is seeking to go on a trip to France.\n* [[Torsten Voges]] as Tina, a woman that has a [[Pituitary disease|pituitary gland disorder]] and is extremely tall.
