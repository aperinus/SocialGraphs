The film received positive reviews, particularly praising [[Josephine Siao]]'s acting and the action choreography. The film had a sequel, ''[[Fong Sai-yuk II]]'', released later the same year in 1993.\n\n==Plot==\nThe brash and ambitious [[Fong Sai-yuk]] meets the beautiful Lui Ting-ting during a track and field competition and falls in love with her. Ting-ting is the daughter of Tiger Lui, a hot-headed hooligan. Lui stages a martial arts competition for interested men to participate and win his daughter's hand in marriage. The contestant must defeat Lui's wife, Siu-wan, in order to win. Fong joins the contest at his friends' urging and defeats Siu-wan. He catches a glimpse of his future bride, who is actually a servant to replace Ting-ting, who had gone missing during the contest. Fong decides to forfeit the match and leaves.\n\nFong's mother, Miu Tsui-fa, enters the contest in disguise as a man to help her son regain his lost pride. She defeats Siu-wan by knocking her off the scaffold, but catches her as she falls and they land safely on the ground. After that intimate moment together, Siu-wan becomes romantically attracted to Miu without knowing that Miu is actually a woman in disguise. Lui then forces Miu to marry his daughter. To save his mother from embarrassment, Fong marries Ting-ting on behalf of his \"brother\" (his mother in disguise as a man), and is confined in his father-in-law's house. He is unaware that his bride is actually his love interest and they fight in the dark. They discover each other's identities eventually.\n\nMiu manages to persuade Lui to let her son return home. Just then, Fong's father, Fong Tak, returns home from a trip. Fong discovers that his father is a member of the [[The Book and the Sword|Red Flower Society]], a secret society seeking to overthrow the ruling [[Qing dynasty]]. While Fong Tak is having a conversation with fellow members, they are ambushed by the [[Nine Gates Infantry Commander|Governor of Nine Gates]] and his soldiers. The Governor demands that Fong Tak hand over the name list of the society's members, but he refuses. Just then, Fong Sai-yuk and his mother show up, and Fong fights with the Governor and holds him off until his parents have escaped.\n\nFong and his parents hide in their in-laws' house to evade the authorities, but the Governor visits Lui's house and recognises them. In the ensuing fight, Fong Tak is captured while Siu-wan dies from a gunshot wound. The Governor stages a public execution of Fong Tak to lure Fong Sai-yuk into a trap. Fong lies to his mother that his father has been rescued and decides to save his father alone without letting her know. He attempts to storm the execution ground and fights with the Governor to save his father. At the critical moment, Miu appears with the Red Flower Society's members and their leader, [[List of The Book and the Sword characters|Chan Ka-lok]]. They defeat the Governor and his men and succeed in freeing Fong Tak. In the end, Fong Sai-yuk becomes Chan's godson and joins his godfather on their quest as they ride towards the horizon.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Jet Li 2009 (cropped).jpg|thumbnail|180px|right|[[Jet Li]] (pictured) portrayed [[Fong Sai-yuk]] and [[film producer|produced]] the film.<ref name=\"hkarchive\" /><ref name=\"allmovie-cc\" />]]\nSources:<ref name=\"hkarchive\">{{cite news|title=Fong Sai-yuk|access-date=16 September 2012|work=[[Hong Kong Film Archive]]|url=http://ipac.hkfa.lcsd.gov.hk/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1P478466J1P50.292&profile=hkfa&uri=full=3100024@!56542@!0&ri=3&aspect=basic_search&menu=search&source=192.168.110.61@!horizon&ipp=20&staffonly=&term=Fong+Sai+Yuk&index=FILMBRP&uindex=&aspect=basic_search&menu=search&ri=3}}</ref><ref name=\"allmovie-cc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/fong-sai-yuk-v132934/cast-crew|work=Allmovie|title=Fong Sai-Yuk (1993) - Cast & Crew|access-date=16 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n*[[Jet Li]] as [[Fong Sai-yuk]]\n*[[Josephine Siao]] as Miu Tsui-fa\n*[[Vincent Zhao]] as the [[Nine Gates Infantry Commander|Governor of Nine Gates]]\n*[[Michelle Reis]] as Lui Ting-ting\n*Paul Chu as Fong Tak\n*[[Sibelle Hu]] as Siu-wan\n*[[Chen Sung-young]] as Lui Lo-fu (Tiger Lui)\n*[[Adam Cheng]] as [[List of The Book and the Sword characters|Chan Ka-lok]]\n\n==Release==\n''Fong Sai-yuk'' was a box office hit on Hong Kong, grossing HK $30,666,842.<ref name=\"hkarchive\" /> In the Philippines, the film was released as ''The Prodigal Fighter'' by Viking Films on December 2, 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Grand Opening Today|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=8cBNEdFwSQkC&dat=19931202&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|access-date=April 19, 2021|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Kamahalan Publishing Corp.|date=December 2, 1993|page=18|quote=Only Asia's No. 1 Action Megastar '''Jet Lee''' Can Deliver!}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Fong Sai-yuk II]]'', was released in the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/fong-sai-yuk-2-v148086|work=Allmovie|title=Fong Sai-Yuk 2|access-date=4 September 2012|author=Blaise, Judd}}</ref>\n\n=== Home media ===\nIn the United Kingdom, the film (released as ''Jet Li's The Legend'') was watched by {{Nowrap|1 million}} viewers on television in 2004, making it the year's tenth most-watched foreign-language film on television (below nine other [[Hong Kong action films]]).
