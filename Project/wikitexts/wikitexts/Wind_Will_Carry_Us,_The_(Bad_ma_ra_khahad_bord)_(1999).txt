In it, an engineer (who turns out to be a kind of filmmaker) travels to a remote Kurdish village with the intent of photographing the funeral rites of a dying 100-year-old woman, and the witty, haunting, poetic film that follows is about his\u2014and Kiarostami's own\u2014struggle to complete that mission, to capture something of real life on film without violating its essence. Kiarostami himself has not worked on a film since, preferring the more portable and less invasive technology of video.
