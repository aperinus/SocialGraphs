It features an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Christian Slater]] and [[Patricia Arquette]], with [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Val Kilmer]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Brad Pitt]], and [[Christopher Walken]] in supporting roles. Slater and Arquette portray newlyweds on the run from the [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] after stealing a shipment of drugs.\n\n''True Romance'' began life as an early script by Tarantino; he sold the screenplay in order to finance his debut feature film, ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' (1992). It is regarded by proponents as a cross-section of writer Tarantino and director Scott's respective trademarks, including a [[Southern California]] setting, pop cultural references, and stylized violence punctuated by [[slow motion]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uproxx.com/filmdrunk/youre-so-cool-20-years-of-true-romance/|title=You're So Cool: Looking Back On 'True Romance' 20 Years Later|date=2014-05-14|website=UPROXX|access-date=2019-05-04|archive-date=2019-05-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190507185540/https://uproxx.com/filmdrunk/youre-so-cool-20-years-of-true-romance/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/09/classic-film-review-true-romance/|title=Classic Film Review: True Romance Remains a Sweet, Distinctly Male Movie|date=2018-09-09|website=Consequence of Sound|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-04|archive-date=2019-05-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190507185540/https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/09/classic-film-review-true-romance/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThough initially a box-office failure, the film's positive reviews, with critics praising the dialogue, characters, and off-beat style,<ref>{{Citation|title=True Romance (1993)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/true_romance|language=en|access-date=2019-05-04|archive-date=2019-04-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402170033/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/true_romance|url-status=live}}</ref> earned it a [[cult following]].

They later have sex at his [[Downtown Detroit|downtown]] apartment. Alabama tearfully confesses that she is a [[call girl]] hired by his boss as a birthday present but has fallen in love with him. The two get married the next day at City Hall. An apparition of Elvis visits Clarence and convinces him to kill Alabama's abusive [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]], Drexl Spivey. Going to the brothel where Alabama worked, he shoots and kills Drexl, and takes a bag he assumes contains Alabama's belongings. Back at the apartment, he and Alabama discover it contains a large amount of [[cocaine]] that Drexl had stolen from two drug pushers.\n\nThe couple visits Clarence's estranged father Clifford, a retired cop, for help. He tells Clarence the police assume Drexl's murder is a gang killing committed in revenge for the murdered dealers. After the couple leave for [[Los Angeles]], Clifford is interrogated by Vincenzo Coccotti, ''[[consigliere]]'' to mobster \"Blue Lou Boyle\", who had hired Drexl to steal and distribute the cocaine on his behalf. He reveals that the mob knows about Clarence's theft since they found his driver's license near Drexl's body. Clifford, realizing he will die anyway, mockingly defies Coccotti, who shoots him dead. One of his men then finds an LA address taped to Clifford's refrigerator. \n\nIn LA, Clarence and Alabama meet Clarence's aspiring actor friend Dick Ritchie, who introduces him to actor and production assistant Elliot Blitzer. He reluctantly agrees to broker the sale of the drugs to his boss, legendary [[film producer]] Lee Donowitz. While Clarence is out buying lunch, Coccotti's enforcer Virgil finds Alabama in her motel room and beats her for information. Alabama fights back, using hairspray to set fire to Virgil's clothes and putting nail polish in his eyes, before grabbing his [[sawn-off shotgun]], stabbing him with a corkscrew, and shooting him to death in a maniacal rage. Clarence tends to her wounds, and they discuss their future together.\n\nElliot is pulled over for speeding and gets charged when his mistress spills a bag of cocaine after he tries to hide it in her dress. To stay out of jail, he agrees to wear a wire and record the drug deal between Clarence and Donowitz for police detectives Dimes and Nicholson. Coccotti's men also learn about where the deal will take place from Dick's stoner roommate Floyd. Clarence, Alabama, Dick, and Elliot go to Donowitz's suite at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] with the drugs. In the elevator, a suspicious Clarence threatens Elliot at gunpoint, but is persuaded by Elliot's pleading for mercy.\n\nClarence fabricates a story for Donowitz that the drugs were given to him by a corrupt cop, and he agrees to the sale. Excusing himself to the bathroom, the vision of Elvis reassures him that things are going well. Donowitz and his bodyguards are ambushed by the cops and the mobsters. Elliot reveals himself to be an informant by asking the cops if he could leave, whereupon a shootout erupts. Dick throws the suitcase of the drugs in the air, where it gets shredded by gunfire, and flees. Donowitz, his bodyguards, Elliot, the cops, and the mobsters are all killed, and Clarence is wounded as he exits the bathroom. He and Alabama escape with Donowitz's money as more police arrive. They flee to Mexico where Alabama gives birth to a son, whom they name Elvis.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Christian Slater]] as Clarence Worley\n* [[Patricia Arquette]] as Alabama Whitman\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as Clifford Worley\n* [[Val Kilmer]] as [[Elvis Presley|Mentor]]\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as Drexl Spivey\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Floyd, Dick's Roommate\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Vincenzo Coccotti\n* [[Bronson Pinchot]] as Elliot Blitzer\n* [[Samuel L.

Released after ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'', it was his first screenplay for a major motion picture, and Tarantino contends that it is his most autobiographical film to date. He had hoped to direct the film, but lost interest in directing and sold the script. According to Tarantino's audio commentary on the DVD release, he was happy with the way it turned out. Apart from changing the nonlinear narrative he wrote to a more conventional linear structure, it was largely faithful to his original screenplay. He initially opposed director Tony Scott's decision to change the ending (which Scott maintained was of his own volition, not the studio's, saying \"I just fell in love with these two characters and didn\u2019t want to see them die\"). When seeing the completed film, he realized Scott's happy ending was more appropriate to the film as Scott directed it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maxim.com/amg/movies/articles/56943/trueromance15yearslater.html |title=True Romance: 15 Years Later |last=Spitz |first=Marc |date=25 April 2008 |publisher=Maxim |work=maxim.com |access-date=16 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816182357/http://www.maxim.com/amg/movies/articles/56943/trueromance15yearslater.html |archive-date=16 August 2011}}</ref>  The film's first act, as well as some fragments of dialogue, were repurposed from Tarantino's 1987 amateur film ''[[My Best Friend's Birthday]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}\n\nThe film's score by [[Hans Zimmer]] is a theme based on [[Gassenhauer]] from [[Carl Orff]]'s ''[[Schulwerk]]''. This theme, combined with a voiceover spoken by Arquette, is an homage to [[Terrence Malick]]'s 1973 crime film ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'', in which [[Sissy Spacek]] speaks the voiceover, and that also shares similar dramatic motifs.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}\n\nThe movie was heavily censored by the UK BBFC. The majority of the confrontation between Alabama and Virgil was cut as well as much of Floyd's drug use. There was also an alternative ending where Detective Nicky Dimes was not shot by Alabama but by Toothpick Vic, one of the mafia hitmen, instead. This edit was the official 1993 VHS release but subsequently all DVD and Blu-ray releases are of the original uncensored American version.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\nOn the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film holds an approval rating of 93% with an average rating of 7.5/10, based on 55 reviews.
