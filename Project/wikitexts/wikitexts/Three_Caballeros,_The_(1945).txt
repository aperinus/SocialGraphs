The film premiered in Mexico City on December 21, 1944. It was released in the United States on February 3, 1945 and in the United Kingdom in March 1945. It was the [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|7th Walt Disney animated feature]] film, and it marks the 10th anniversary of [[Donald Duck]] and plots an adventure through parts of Latin America, combining [[live-action]] and [[traditional animation|animation]]. This is the second of the six package films released by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] in the 1940s, following ''[[Saludos Amigos]]'' (1942). It is also notable for being one of the first feature-length films to incorporate traditional animation with live-action actors.<ref name=\"ew\">{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/gallery/5-best-and-5-worst-live-actionanimation-hybrid-movies |title=5 Best \u2013 and 5 Worst \u2013 Live-Action/Animation Hybrid Movies|last2=Schwarzbaum|first2=Lisacn|date=2013-07-31|last1=Gleiberman |first1=Owen |newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=January 19, 2022}}</ref>\n\nThe film is plotted as a series of self-contained segments, strung together by the device of [[Donald Duck]] opening birthday gifts from his Latin American friends. Several Latin American stars of the period appear, including singers [[Aurora Miranda]] (sister of [[Carmen Miranda]]) and [[Dora Luz]], as well as singer and dancer [[Carmen Molina (actress)|Carmen Molina]].\n\nThe film was produced as part of the studio's [[Good Neighbor policy|goodwill message]] for Latin America.<ref>{{cite interview|last=Disney|first=Walt|interviewer=[[Fletcher Markle]]|title=An Interview with Walt Disney|work=Orson Welles Mercury Theater}}</ref> The film stars [[Donald Duck]], who in the course of the film is joined by old friend [[Jos\u00e9 Carioca]], the cigar-smoking parrot from ''Saludos Amigos'', who represents [[Brazil]], and later becomes friends with a pistol-packing rooster named [[Panchito Pistoles]], who represents [[Mexico]].\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe film, celebrating Donald Duck's 10th anniversary, consists of seven segments, each connected by a common theme. In the film, it is [[Donald Duck]]'s birthday (namely Friday the 13th), and he receives three presents from friends in [[Latin America]]. The first present is a [[Movie projector|film projector]], which shows him a documentary about birds called {{lang|es|\"Aves Raras\"}}. The first segment of the documentary tells the story of Pablo, a penguin seeking the warm weather of Equatorial South America. The next segment details some of the odd birds of Latin America. During this part documentary, he learns about the [[Aracuan Bird]], who received his name because of his eccentric song. The documentary then shifts to the perspective of a man narrating a story from his childhood, where he discovers and befriends a donkey with the wings of a condor in [[Uruguay]].\n\nThe next present is a book given to Donald by Jos\u00e9. This book tells of [[Bahia]] (spelled \"Ba\u00eda\" in the film), which is one of Brazil's 26 states. Jos\u00e9 shrinks them both down so that they can enter the book. Donald and Jos\u00e9 meet up with several of the locals, who dance a lively [[samba]], and Donald ends up pining for one girl Yaya, the cookie seller, but fails and gets jealous of another man. After the journey, Donald and Jos\u00e9 leave the book.\n\nUpon returning, Donald realizes that he is too small to open his third present. Jos\u00e9 shows Donald how to use \"black magic\" to return himself to the proper size. After opening the present, he meets Panchito, a native of Mexico. The trio take the name \"The Three Caballeros\" and have a short celebration. Panchito then presents Donald's next present, a {{lang|es|[[pi\u00f1ata]]}}. Panchito tells Donald of the tradition behind the pi\u00f1ata. Jos\u00e9 and Panchito then blindfold Donald, and have him attempt to break open the pi\u00f1ata, eventually revealing many surprises. The celebration draws to a close when Donald is fired away by firecrackers in the shape of a ferocious toy bull (with which the [[firecracker]]s are lit by Jos\u00e9 with his cigar).\n\nThroughout the film, the [[List of Donald Duck universe characters#Aracuan Bird|Aracuan Bird]] appears at random moments. He usually taunts everyone with his madcap antics, sometimes stealing Jos\u00e9's cigar and trying to make Jos\u00e9 jealous. His most famous gag is when he re-routes a train that Donald and Jos\u00e9 are riding on by drawing new tracks, causing the train to disassemble.\n\nThe film consists of seven segments:\n\n=== \"The Cold-Blooded Penguin\" ===\nThis segment is narrated by [[Sterling Holloway]], reproducing images of the penguins of in [[Antarctica]]. In the segment, a penguin named Pablo is so fed up with the freezing conditions of the [[South Pole]] that he decides to leave his home for warmer climates, navigating the long coast of Chile (including the [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]] and [[Vi\u00f1a del Mar]]), passing by [[Lima]] (the capital of [[Peru]]) and [[Quito]] (the capital of [[Ecuador]]) before landing on the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.comhem.se/~u70901683/movies/three_cabelleros/3caballeros.htm|title=The Three Caballeros|publisher=Comhem|language=en|access-date=August 18, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916020327/http://web.comhem.se/~u70901683/movies/three_cabelleros/3caballeros.htm|archive-date=September 16, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== \"The Flying Gauchito\" ===\nThis segment, with adult narration provided by Fred Shields, involves the adventures of a little boy from Uruguay and a winged donkey, who goes by the name of Burrito (which is Spanish for \"little donkey\").\n\n=== \"Ba\u00eda\" ===\n[[File:Aurora Miranda Tres Caballeros.jpg|thumb|Brazilian singer [[Aurora Miranda]] in ''The Three Caballeros''.]]\nThis segment involves a pop-up book trip through the Brazilian state of [[Bahia]] (spelled Ba\u00eda in the film), as Donald and Jos\u00e9 meet up with some of the locals who dance a samba and Donald pining for one of the women, portrayed by singer [[Aurora Miranda]].\n\n=== \"Las Posadas\" ===\nThis is the story of a group of Mexican children who celebrated [[Christmas]] by re-enacting the journey of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]] and [[Saint Joseph]] searching for room at the inn. {{lang|es|\"Posada\"}} meant \"inn\", or \"shelter\", and their parents told them \"no {{lang|es|posada}}\" at each house until they came to one where they were offered shelter in a stable. This leads to festivities including the breaking of the {{lang|es|italic=no|pi\u00f1ata}}, which in turn leads to Donald Duck trying to break his ''own'' {{lang|es|italics=no|pi\u00f1ata}} as well.\n\n=== \"Mexico: P\u00e1tzcuaro, Veracruz and Acapulco\" ===\nPanchito gives Donald and Jos\u00e9 a tour of [[Mexico City]] and the country of Mexico on a flying [[sarape]], or magic carpet. Several Mexican dances and songs are learned here. A key point to what happens later is that Donald is pining for some more ladies again, tries to hound down every single one he sees, and gain return affections, but once more he fails every time and ends up kissing Jos\u00e9 while blindfolded.\n\n=== \"You Belong to My Heart\" and \"Donald's Surreal Reverie\" ===\nThe skies of Mexico City result in Donald falling in love with singer [[Dora Luz]]. The lyrics in the song itself play parts in the scenarios as to what is happening as well. Then several imagined kisses lead to Donald going into the \"Love is a drug\" scene. Donald constantly envisions sugar rush colors, flowers, and Panchito and Jos\u00e9 popping in at the worst moments, making chaos. The scene changes after Donald manages to dance with [[Carmen Molina (actress)|Carmen Molina]] from the [[Oaxaca state|state of Oaxaca]], from the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]]. The two dance and sing the song {{lang|es|italic=no|\"[[La Sandunga|La Zandunga]]\"}}. Carmen begins by singing the song, with Donald \"quacking\" out the rest of the chorus with her. The \"drunkenness\" slows down for a second after Donald multiplied himself while dancing, but speeds up again when Carmen reappears dressed in a [[Charro]]'s outfit and uses a horsewhip as a conductor's baton to make [[cactus|cacti]] appear in many different forms while dancing to {{lang|es|italic=no|\"[[Jesusita en Chihuahua]]\"}}, a trademark song of the [[Mexican Revolution]]. This scene is notable for providing the masterful combination of live-action and cartoon animation, as well as animation among the cacti.\n\nThe scene is interrupted when Panchito and Jos\u00e9 suddenly spice things up for the finale of the movie, and Donald ends up battling the same toy bull with wheels on its legs the day before from earlier. The catch is that it is now loaded with fireworks and other explosives, following with a fireworks finale with the words \"The End\" exploding from the fireworks, first in Spanish ({{lang|es|Fin}}), in the colors of the [[flag of Mexico]], then the second in Portuguese ({{lang|pt|Fim}}), in the colors of the [[flag of Brazil]], and finally in English, in the colors of the [[flag of the United States]] (''The End'').\n\n== Production ==\n=== Influence ===\n[[Agust\u00edn Lara]]'s song \"[[You Belong to My Heart]]\" was featured in a Disney short called ''[[Pluto's Blue Note]]'' (1947). It was later recorded by [[Bing Crosby]]. [[Ary Barroso]]'s song \"Bahia\" and the title song became popular hit tunes in the 1940s. The complete \"Bahia\" sequence was cut from the 1977 theatrical reissue of the film.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hischack |first=Thomas|author2=Mark Robinson |title=The Disney Song Encyclopedia\n|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]] |year=2009\n}}</ref>\n\nSome clips from this film were used in the \"Welcome to Rio\" portion of the ''[[Mickey Mouse Disco]]'' music video.\n\n[[Don Rosa]] wrote and drew two comic book sequels: ''[[The Three Caballeros Ride Again]]'' (2000) and ''[[The Magnificent Seven (Minus 4) Caballeros]]'' (2005).\n\nIn September 2006, Panchito and Jos\u00e9 returned to Walt Disney World where they appeared for meet and greets. They were only found outside the Mexico pavilion in [[World Showcase]] at Epcot. Donald also appeared with them.\n\nThe 2011 [[Mickey's Soundsational Parade]] at [[Disneyland]] features all three Caballeros and the [[Aracuan Bird]] in one parade unit.\n\n==Voice cast ==\n[[File:Dora Luz Tres Caballeros.jpg|thumb|Mexican singer [[Dora Luz]] in the film.]]\n* [[Clarence Nash]] as [[Donald Duck]]\n* [[Jos\u00e9 do Patroc\u00ednio Oliveira]] as [[Jos\u00e9 Carioca]] (Used in the Brazilian Portuguese version)\n* [[Joaquin Garay]] as [[Panchito Pistoles]] (Used in the Mexican Spanish version)\n* [[Pinto Colvig]] as the Aracuan Bird\n* [[Aurora Miranda]] as Yaya\n* [[Dora Luz]]\n* [[Carmen Molina (actress)|Carmen Molina]]\n* [[Sterling Holloway]] as the Narrator (''Pablo the Cold-Blooded Penguin'')\n* [[Frank Graham (voice actor)|Frank Graham]] as the Narrator\n* Fred Shields as the Narrator (''The Flying Gauchito'') (Used in the Mexican Spanish version)\n* Francisco \"Frank\" Mayorga as the Mexican Guitarist\n* Nestor Amaral as [[Jos\u00e9 Carioca]] singing voice ''Baia''\n* [[Tr\u00edo Calaveras]]\n* Tr\u00edo Ascencio del R\u00edo\n* Padua Hills Player\n* [[Carlos Ram\u00edrez (singer)|Carlos Ram\u00edrez]] \u2013 ''Mexico''\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe film's original score was composed by [[Edward H. Plumb]], [[Paul Smith (composer)|Paul J. Smith]], and [[Charles Wolcott]].\n\n* The title song, \"The Three Caballeros\", based its melody on {{lang|es|italic=no|\"[[Ay, Jalisco, no te rajes!]]\"}}, a Mexican song composed by [[Manuel Esper\u00f3n]] with lyrics by Ernesto Cort\u00e1zar. {{lang|es|italic=no|\"Ay, Jalisco, no te rajes!\"}} was originally released in a 1941 film of the same name, starring [[Jorge Negrete]]. After seeing Manuel Esper\u00f3n's success in the Mexican movie industry, Walt Disney called him personally to ask him to participate in the movie. New English lyrics were written to the song by [[Ray Gilbert]].\n*\"Ba\u00eda\" based its melody on the Brazilian song {{lang|pt|italic=no|\"[[Na Baixa do Sapateiro]]\"}} which was written by [[Ary Barroso]] and first released in 1938. New English lyrics were written by Ray Gilbert. Another Ary Barroso song, {{lang|pt|italic=no|\"[[Aquarela do Brasil]]\"}}, was featured in the earlier film ''[[Saludos Amigos]]'' with its original Portuguese lyrics.\n* \"[[Have You Been to Bahia?]]\" was written by [[Dorival Caymmi]] and was originally released in 1941. The song was translated into English with no major changes, other than replacing the word {{lang|pt|italic=no|\"nega\"}} (a woman of African descent) with \"Donald\", who the song is addressed to in the film. Parts of the song are still sung in its original Portuguese.\n*\"Pandeiro & Flute\" was written by Benedito Lacerda, and is played during the Baia train sequence. It is the opinion of Disney's Chief Archivist Emeritus, [[Dave Smith (archivist)|Dave Smith]], that the piece was not written originally for the film, but was instead licensed to Disney; however, he is unaware of any evidence that proves this opinion. The piece was developed by Charles Wolcott, and Lacerda went uncredited in the film.<ref name=\"Ask Dave June 14, 2012\">{{cite web\n |url=http://d23.disney.go.com/news/2012/06/d23-presents-ask-dave-june-12-2012/ \n |title=D23 Presents Ask Dave: June 12, 2012 \n |first=Dave |last=Smith \n |publisher=[[Disney D23]] \n |access-date=June 14, 2012 \n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615214959/http://d23.disney.go.com/news/2012/06/d23-presents-ask-dave-june-12-2012/\n |archive-date=June 15, 2012\n |quote=While written by Lacerda (1903\u20131958) and licensed by Disney, it was developed by Charles Wolcott and Lacerda was uncredited.
