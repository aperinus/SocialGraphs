Folke Nilsson ([[Tomas Norstr\u00f6m]]) is assigned to study the habits of Isak Bj\u00f8rvik ([[Joachim Calmeyer]]). By the rules of the research institute, Folke has to sit on an [[Umpire|umpire's]] chair in Isak's kitchen and observe him from there, but never talk to him. Isak volunteered for the program with the promise of a horse, but he only receives a [[dala horse]], a little painted wooden statue.\n\nIsak stops using his kitchen and observes Folke through a hole in the ceiling instead. The two lonely men, observer and observed, slowly overcome the initial Norwegian-Swede and subject-observer distrust and become [[friend]]s. Isak's friend Grant visits him often.  Grant is a concentration camp survivor and feels Folke is stealing his friend.\n\nThe friendship between Folke and Isak costs Folke his job during an inspection. He is forced to leave and drive up to the Swedish border, but then he returns, only to find Isak has died of a broken heart. Folke, now alone, occupies Isak's home and takes up Isak's friendship with Grant.\n\n==Inspiration for the film==\nBent Hamer was amused after perusing [[post-war|post-World War II]] research books on the efficiency of the Swedish [[housewife]], and pondered on the idea of research being done on [[Man|men]]. This led him to make the film ''Kitchen Stories'' with Swedish researchers and a Norwegian man as the main character.\n\n==Cast ==\n*[[Joachim Calmeyer]] as Isak Bj\u00f8rvik, the man in the kitchen\n*[[Tomas Norstr\u00f6m]] as Folke Nilsson, the Swedish researcher\n*[[Bj\u00f8rn Floberg]] as Grant, the friend of Isak\n*[[Reine Brynolfsson]] as Malmberg\n*[[Sverre Anker Ousdal]] as Dr. Jack Zac.
