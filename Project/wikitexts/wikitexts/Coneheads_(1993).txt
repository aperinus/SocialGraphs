The film is based on the [[NBC]] ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' [[Sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] about [[Coneheads|aliens stranded on Earth]], who have [[Anglicisation|Anglicized]] their Remulakian surname to \"Conehead\". Michelle Burke took over the role played by [[Laraine Newman]] on ''SNL''. The film also features roles and cameos by actors and comedians from ''SNL'' and other television series of the time.\n\nThree years after the release of ''Coneheads'', screenwriters Bonnie & Terry Turner and star Jane Curtin revisited the premise of aliens arriving on Earth and assimilating into American society with the TV show ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]'', with Curtin instead playing a human character.\n\n==Plot==\nUpon discovering a [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] in American airspace, the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] sends fighter jets to investigate, who fire on the unresponsive craft and cause it to crash into the [[Atlantic Ocean]], near [[Manhattan]]. The aliens from the planet Remulak aboard, Beldar Clorhone and his \"genetomate\" Prymaat, survive and quickly adapt to the human lifestyle, despite their conspicuous conical-shaped heads and metallic-sounding voices. Assigned by Highmaster Mintot to conquer Earth (a 'Protoid Re-fueling Station') as 'Fuel Survey Underlord of the Wilderness Planet at the end of the Noctolium Solar Chain', Beldar becomes an appliance repairman, and upon discovering his undocumented status, his boss Otto arranges for a false identity, which quickly alerts the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]]. Meanwhile, after the couple discover from fellow Remulakian Marlax Zanthstrom that a rescue vessel will not arrive for seven \"Zurls\" (many years), Prymaat informs Beldar she is pregnant. Ambitious INS agent Gorman Sneedling and his assistant Eli Turnbull unsuccessfully attempt to capture the couple.\n\nMonths later, Beldar has become a respected taxi driver, and the couple live in his boss, Khoudri's basement. After their daughter Connie's birth, they buy a home and move to suburban [[Paramus, New Jersey]], adopting the surname Conehead, where Beldar begins another new career as a driving instructor. Meanwhile, Gorman gets a promotion and decides to leave the Coneheads' case to his replacement, but the case's extreme expense forces him to ensure its closure.\n\nThe now-teenaged Connie simply wants to fit in with her peers, though her father greatly objects, especially when she begins seeing auto mechanic Ronnie Bradford. This causes tension between Connie and Beldar, who strongly disapproves of Ronnie, even tearing the roof off of his car and threatening to kill him after he tries to make love with Connie, which irritates her. Despite this, Ronnie and Connie reconcile after talking. Meanwhile, Beldar is preoccupied with winning a golfing trophy at his country club, while Prymaat becomes concerned about his attractiveness to her due to one of his driving students, Gladys Johnson, flirting with him.\n\nGorman and Eli track the Coneheads to their home, posing as [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] to enter. During the conversation, Prymaat discovers their communication device to Remulak is beeping and notifies Beldar that 'the Big Phone' has contacted him, causing him to promptly eject the two. He is then notified of their approaching rescue vessel.\n\nAt a costume party that night, Beldar wins the golfing trophy. After Connie is told of their imminent rescue, she returns home with Ronnie, where she almost consummates their relationship using her parents' \"senso-rings\". Beldar and Prymaat discover them, just as the INS arrives to arrest the Coneheads. Ronnie helps stall the INS while the rescue vessel arrives just in time, and Gorman and Eli are taken aboard with the Coneheads.\n\nOn Remulak, Beldar is welcomed home, presenting the Highmaster with various Earthly 'gifts', including Gorman and Eli as slaves. Initially satisfied with Beldar's accomplishments, Mintot notices that Beldar's teeth are capped (something Otto had advised Beldar to do to blend in), accuses him of treason and sentences him to fight the ferocious Garthok (\"knarfle the Garthok\"), greatly distressing Prymaat.\n\nAfter the Garthok easily and gruesomely kills other criminals sentenced to fight it, Beldar uses his Earthly golfing skills to save himself, killing the creature. Afterwards, he requests to return to Earth to oversee its conquest, taking Gorman back with him as a minion. Mintot agrees and hires Eli as his personal assistant, who quickly acclimates to his new role. Departing for Earth with Prymaat, Connie, and Gorman in tow, Beldar soon prioritizes Connie's feelings over planetary conquest by quickly faking an Earth attack, ordering his invasion force to retreat and proceed to their secondary target in another part of the galaxy, while making it look like a superior weapon has destroyed his spaceship. For rescuing him, Gorman agrees to give the Coneheads [[United States Permanent Resident Card|Green Cards]] due to Beldar's marketable talent.\n\nRonnie arrives to take Connie to the prom. Beldar gives him 55 words of advice, and then uses a massive flash bulb arrangement on his home-built Polaroid camera to document the happy event. As Connie and a now-sunburned Ronnie depart, he and Prymaat review the oversized photo, saying, \"Ah, memories. We will enjoy them\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col begin|colwidth=}}\n*[[Dan Aykroyd]] as Beldar Clorhone (later Conehead) / Donald R.

Additionally, co-writer Terry Turner cameos in the film as the sketch artist that Seedling describes Beldar to. Dan Aykroyd's real life daughter Danielle and brother Peter appear as 3-year-old Connie and Highmaster Mentot respectively.\n\n==Production==\n[[Tom Davis (comedian)|Tom Davis]], who created the characters on ''Saturday Night Live'', wrote the first version of the screenplay. He was unhappy with choices made by the producers, including setting the Remulak scenes in a gladiators' arena, rather than the suburban environment that he envisioned.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=Tom |title=Thirty-Nine Years of Short-Term Memory Loss: The Early Days of SNL from Someone Who Was There |date=2010 |publisher=Grove Atlantic |isbn=9781555849160 |page=222}}</ref>\n\nWhile there are some differences, ''Coneheads'' mostly follows the same plot as in  the [[Coneheads#Adaptations|animated special]] that was created ten years earlier. Similarities include the Coneheads being stranded on Earth, Beldar working as an appliance repair man, and Connie dating an earthling named Ronnie.\n\nThe film mostly takes place in [[Paramus, New Jersey]].
