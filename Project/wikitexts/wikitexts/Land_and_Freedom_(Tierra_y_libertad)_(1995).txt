The film narrates the story of David Carr, an unemployed worker and member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], who decides to fight in the [[Spanish Civil War]] for the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|republicans]], a coalition of [[Socialism|Socialists]], [[Communism|Communists]] and [[Anarchism|Anarchists]] against a nationalist coup d'etat. The film won the [[FIPRESCI]] International Critics Prize and the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]] at the [[1995 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3365/year/1995.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Land and Freedom |access-date=4 September 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> The film was also nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] at Cannes.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film's narrative unfolds in a long [[Flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]. David Carr has died at an old age and his granddaughter discovers old letters, newspapers and other documents in his room: what we see in the film is what he had lived.\n\nCarr, a young unemployed worker and member of the Communist Party, leaves [[Liverpool]] and travels to Spain to join the [[International Brigade]]s. He crosses the Spanish border in Catalonia and coincidentally ends up enlisted in a [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification|POUM]] [[militia]] commanded by Lawrence, in the [[Aragon]] front. In this company, as in all POUM militias, men and women \u2013 such as the young and enthusiastic Maite \u2013 fight together. In the following weeks and months he becomes friends with other foreign volunteers, like the Frenchman, Bernard and the Irishman, Coogan and the latter's girlfriend Blanca \u2013 with whom David Carr later falls in love \u2013 also a member of POUM, and also the [[ideologue]] of his group.\n\nAfter being wounded and recovering in a hospital in [[Barcelona]], he finally joins \u2013 in accordance with his original plan and against the opinion of Blanca \u2013 the government-backed International Brigades, and he encounters the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] propaganda and repression against POUM members and anarchists; he then returns to his old company, only to see them rounded up by a government unit requiring their surrender: in a brief clash Blanca is killed. After her funeral he returns to Great Britain with a red [[neckerchief]] full of Spanish earth.\n\nFinally the film returns to the present and we see Carr's funeral, in which his granddaughter throws the Spanish earth into his grave after speaking lines from \"The Day Is Coming\",<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/morris/works/1885/chants/poems/poem1.htm Chants for Socialists by William Morris \u2013 1. The Day is Coming], [[Marxist Internet Archive]]</ref> a poem by [[William Morris]].\n<blockquote>''Join in the battle wherein no man can fail,''\n<br/>''For whoso fadeth and dieth, yet his deed shall still prevail.''</blockquote>\nAfterwards she performs a [[raised fist]] salute, honoring his beliefs.\n\n==Cast==\n\n*[[Ian Hart]] \u2013 David Carr\n*[[Rosana Pastor]] \u2013 Blanca\n*[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pierrot]] \u2013 Bernard Goujon\n*[[Tom Gilroy]] \u2013 Lawrence\n*[[Ic\u00edar Bolla\u00edn]] \u2013 Maite\n*[[Marc Mart\u00ednez (actor)|Marc Mart\u00ednez]] \u2013 Juan Vidal\n*[[Andr\u00e9s Aladren]] \u2013 Militia member\n*[[Sergi Calleja]] \u2013 Militia member\n*[[Raffaele Cantatore]] \u2013 Militia member\n*[[Pascal Demolon]] \u2013 Militia member\n*[[Paul Laverty]] \u2013 Militia member\n*[[Suzanne Maddock]] \u2013 Kim (David's granddaughter)\n\n==Themes==\nAccording to Ken Loach, the most important scene of the film is the debate in an [[Deliberative assembly|assembly]] of a village successfully liberated by the militia. People from the actual village where the film was shot play peasant parts in the film and express their thoughts freely (despite language difficulties), and a debate ensues about whether or not to [[collectivise|collectivize]] the village land and that of the recently shot priest. An American with the POUM militia argues that the war effort must come first, suggesting that collectivization and other revolutionary actions might hamper that effort. He mentions that if such actions and the slogans accompanying them continue, they will not gain the support of  powerful capitalist regimes such as the United States and Britain{{Clarify|date=December 2009}} (\"You're scaring them\", he says). The necessity of a contemporaneous war and revolution is expressed by a German militiaman, who says that 'in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] revolution was postponed and now [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] is in power'. In the end the villagers vote for collectivization, thereby taking steps on a far-left path. In the anarchist and socialist controlled areas this kind of expropriation of land was common, as the civil war was accompanied by a [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|social revolution]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.historytoday.com/paul-preston/spanish-civil-war-1936-1939| author=Paul Preston| title=The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939| publisher=History Today| access-date=March 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs in the above scene, various languages: Spanish, English and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] are spoken throughout the film, and subtitles are used selectively. Carr arrives in Spain without knowing any Spanish, but gradually picks it up \u2013 and luckily for him English is the ''[[lingua franca]]'' in his militia.\n\nThe social revolution was opposed by both the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-supported communists and the democratic republicans and as the war progressed, the government and the communists were able to leverage their access to Soviet arms to restore government control over the war effort, both through diplomacy and force. An historical event, the bloody fight between Republicans and Anarchists for controlling the [[Telef\u00f3nica]] building in Barcelona, has been chosen by Loach as an emblem of this internal conflict (See [[Barcelona May Days]]). Carr's  disenchantment starts from this meaningless fight, which he fails to understand because both groups were supposed to be on the same side. At one point he is guarding the Communist Party headquarters in Barcelona and engages in banter across the barricades with the anarchists opposite. He asks a [[Manchester|Mancunian]] among them \"Why aren't you over here with us?\" In reply his compatriot asks him the same question and Carr answers \"I don't know\".\n\nAnother important moment inspired by actual events is the execution of a village [[Holy Orders|priest]] for acting in favor of the fascist side: he has broken the seal of [[Confession (religion)#Confession of sins|confessions]], telling the fascists where the anarchists were hiding and causing their deaths. The priest is also shown to have a bruised shoulder from firing a rifle.\n\nMost critics and viewers noted the similarity between the story narrated in this film and [[George Orwell]]'s book ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'', in which the author wrote one of the more famous accounts of the war, that of his own experience as a volunteer in the [[ILP Contingent]], part of the POUM militia.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n*A Las Barricades - Courtesy of Confederaci\u00f3n de Nacional del Trabajo\n*La Internacional (1888) - Written by [[Pierre De Geyter]]\n*A Las Mujeres/\"Ramona\" (1928) - Music by [[Mabel Wayne]] - Lyrics by L.
