It stars [[Lee Kang-sheng]], [[Chen Shiang-chyi]], and [[Lu Yi-ching]].\n\n==Plot==\nHsiao-kang is a street vendor in [[Taipei]] who sells watches out of a briefcase. His father dies. Soon afterwards, Shiang-chyi goes to him to buy a dual-time watch, as she is taking a trip to [[Paris]]. She likes Hsiao-kang's personal watch, which is out of stock. At first, he refuses to sell his watch, explaining that his father just died and that it would be bad luck. She is persistent and eventually convinces him to sell the watch to her. Hsiao-kang's mother mourns her husband's death; she leaves out food and water for him and thinks that he could be reincarnated. Hsiao-kang watches a film set in Paris, ''[[The 400 Blows]]''. During his daily routines, he changes every watch and clock to Paris time. Meanwhile, in Paris, Shiang-chyi is alone as she stays in her room and goes to shops, restaurants, and the subway. Hsiao-kang's mother sees that the clock in her house has changed time and thinks that it is because her husband is back. She turns off the lights in the house and blocks all the windows, and she and Hsiao-kang argue.\n\nShiang-chyi visits a cemetery and has a chance encounter with [[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]], the lead actor of ''The 400 Blows''. At a restaurant, she meets another Chinese woman, and they go back to the Chinese woman's place. They sleep in the same bed and kiss before the Chinese woman turns away. Hsiao-kang's mother eats dinner with a plate set for her husband, and afterwards she masturbates in bed. Hsiao-kang spends the night out and then has sex with a prostitute in his car. While he is sleeping, the prostitute steals his briefcase of watches and leaves. Hsiao-kang goes home and lays down next to his mother. Shiang-chyi cries while sitting on a bench by a pool. She falls asleep, and some people take her suitcase and put it in the pool. Hsiao-kang's father appears. He takes the suitcase out of the water and walks away.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Lee Kang-sheng]] as Hsiao-kang\n*[[Chen Shiang-chyi]] as Shiang-chyi\n*[[Lu Yi-ching]] as Hsiao-kang's mother\n*[[Miao Tien]] as Hsiao-kang's father\n*[[Cecilia Yip]] as Chinese woman in Paris\n*[[Chen Chao-jung]] as Chinese man in subway\n*Tsai Guei as Prostitute\n*[[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]] as Jean-Pierre / Man at cemetery\n*{{ill|Arthur Nauzyciel|fr||ru|\u041d\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0441\u044c\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u0410\u0440\u0442\u044e\u0440}} as Man at telephone booth\n*David Ganansia as Man at restaurant\n*Tsai Chao-yi as Clock store owner\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 85% based on 54 reviews and an average rating of 7.1/10.
