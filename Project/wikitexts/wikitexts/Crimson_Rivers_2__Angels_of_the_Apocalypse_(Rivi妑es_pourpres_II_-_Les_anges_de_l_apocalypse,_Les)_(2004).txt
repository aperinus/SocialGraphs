Reno and Magimel are joined by a religious specialist called Marie, played by [[Camille Natta]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jean Reno]] \u2013 Commissaire Niemans\n* [[Beno\u00eet Magimel]] \u2013 Capitaine Reda\n* [[Christopher Lee]] \u2013 Heinrich von Garten\n* [[Camille Natta]] \u2013 Marie\n* [[Serge Riaboukine]] \u2013 Father Vincent\n* [[Gabrielle Lazure]] \u2013 Philippe's wife\n* [[Augustin Legrand]] \u2013 J\u00e9sus\n* [[Johnny Hallyday]] \u2013 The blind hermit\n* [[Micha\u00ebl Abiteboul]] and [[Eriq Ebouaney]] \u2013 The cops\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0337103}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|les_rivieres_pourpres_ii_les_anges_de_lapocalypse}}\n* {{Mojo title|lesrivierespourpres2}}\n\n{{Olivier Dahan}}\n{{Luc Besson}}\n{{Johnny Hallyday}}\n\n[[Category:2000s supernatural thriller films]]\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:French supernatural thriller films]]\n[[Category:French detective films]]\n[[Category:French sequel films]]\n[[Category:French police films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Olivier Dahan]]\n[[Category:Parkour in film]]\n[[Category:French action thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Colin Towns]]\n[[Category:Police detective films]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]\n\n{{2000s-France-film-stub}}\n{{action-thriller-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
