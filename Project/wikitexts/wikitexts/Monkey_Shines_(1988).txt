Romero]] and starring [[Jason Beghe]], [[Kate McNeil]], [[John Pankow]], and [[Joyce Van Patten]]. Its plot follows a young athlete who becomes a paralyzed [[Tetraplegia|quadriplegic]], and develops a bond with an intelligent [[Service animal|service monkey]] named \"Ella\" who becomes homicidal after she is injected with an experimental serum of human [[human brain|brain tissue]]. It is based on the 1983 British [[Monkey Shines (novel)|novel of the same title]] by [[Michael Stewart (writer)|Michael Stewart]].\n\nProducers [[Peter Grunwald]] and [[Charles Evans (businessman)|Charles Evans]] of [[Orion Pictures]] acquired the rights to Stewart's novel in 1985, and began production two years later, with Romero assigned to direct. The film marked Romero's first major studio feature, and was his second-most expensive film at that time, with a budget of $7 million. The setting was changed from [[Oxford]], England, where the novel was set, to [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, a city in which Romero had long resided and often set his films. Principal photography of ''Monkey Shines'' took place in Pittsburgh in the late summer and early fall of 1987. It had a protracted [[post-production]] and editing process, as Romero shot more film than he had on any of his previous projects, particularly due to the use of live monkeys.\n\n''Monkey Shines'' was released theatrically by Orion Pictures in July 1988, receiving mixed reviews and a lackluster box-office reception, grossing $5.3 million against its $7 million budget. In the intervening years, the film has been noted by critics as an offbeat entry in Romero's [[George A. Romero filmography|filmography]], and has earned status as a minor [[cult following|cult film]].<ref name=irish>{{cite news|work=[[The Irish News]]|last=McLean|first=Ralph|title=Cult Movie: Monkey Shines a rare miss for chiller master George A Romero|url=https://www.irishnews.com/arts/2018/11/09/news/cult-movie-monkey-shines-a-rare-miss-for-chiller-master-george-a-romero-1478733/|date=November 9, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/zeJ5V|archive-date=January 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nLaw student and athlete Allan Mann is struck by a truck and rendered [[Tetraplegia|quadriplegic]] following surgery. As his overbearing mother and strict nurse try helping him, Allan, now in a [[Sip-and-puff|SNP]]-equipped wheelchair, struggles to adjust. His friend, Geoffrey Fisher, suggests he get a [[Capuchin monkey]] as a [[service animal]] to lift his spirits and help around the house. Geoffrey has an ulterior motive: he is a research scientist under pressure to produce results. Geoffrey has dosed a monkey in his lab with a serum to boost its intelligence, and believes the serum's effects will be amplified if the monkey is around humans.\n\nGeoffrey enlists Melanie Parker, a specialist in training [[helper monkey]]s. Geoffrey provides the Capuchin he has been experimenting on, claiming it is normal. Allan names the monkey Ella, and he and Melanie work closely training her. Initially, Ella is a huge help to Allan. Allan grows very close to Melanie.  \n \nAllan grows short-tempered and resentful. Ella, too, becomes aggressive. Allan dreams of running through the grass at night, and believes he has a [[telepathy|telepathic]] link with Ella, whom he suspects can escape the house. Geoffrey finds evidence confirming this but, pleased with Ella's intelligence, does not tell Allan and Melanie. After the pet bird of Allan's nurse pesters him, Allan wishes it was dead - that night, Ella kills the bird and leaves it in the nurse's slipper; causing the nurse to quit.\n\nAllan gets a second opinion about his paralysis and discovers he may have been misdiagnosed; another surgery may enable him to walk again. Before attempting the risky surgery, the doctor needs Allan to demonstrate some ability to move an appendage. Rather than feeling happy at this news, Allan is angry with his original surgeon, who may have purposely misdiagnosed him and is now dating Allan's former girlfriend. He fantasizes about burning the man's cabin down, and that night, Ella kills the surgeon and his girlfriend by burning down the cabin with a pack of stolen matches.\n\nAfter seeing the fire in a vision and having it confirmed by his mother, the horrified Allan believes that Ella is carrying out his dark impulses. He also realizes that when he is around Ella, he becomes easily enraged. Allan demands that Geoffrey take Ella away. With Ella gone, Allan becomes more relaxed; he spends the weekend at Melanie's house and the two have sex.\n\nAllan returns home and tries to mend bridges with his mother, but feels a burst of rage at her disapproval of Melanie. Allan realizes that Ella must be nearby. Allan's mother ignores his desperate warnings that she leave, and instead takes a bath. Ella kills her by dropping a hairdryer into the tub, [[electrocution|electrocuting]] her. Allan briefly answers a call from Melanie before Ella disables the phone; concerned, Melanie departs for Allan's house.\n\nGeoffrey arrives and confesses that Ella was an experimental subject. The enraged Allan demands Geoffrey leave, upset at being used for an experiment yet concerned for his safety with Ella around. Instead, Geoffrey pursues Ella around the house; intending to [[Animal euthanasia|put her down]] with one of the [[syringes]] of [[Pentobarbital|sodium pentobarbitone]] he has brought. Ella gets hold of one of the syringes and injects it into Geoffrey, killing him.\n\nElla returns to Allan, who is filled with self loathing because he believes that Ella is acting out his own impulses. He screams at Ella, but the monkey responds by [[Dominance hierarchy|urinating on him]]. Melanie arrives and Ella attacks her. This convinces Allan that Ella is not simply carrying out his desires. Melanie falls and is knocked unconscious. As Allan rages at Ella, she ignores him and prepares to inject Melanie with one of Geoffrey's syringes. Allan calms himself and moves his right arm to engage his tape deck. As peaceful music plays he lovingly summons Ella to cuddle close to him, and she complies. When Ella comes near enough, Allan bites her on the neck and slams her body against the back of his wheelchair, killing her.\n\nAllan undergoes successful spinal surgery. Melanie arrives at the hospital to pick him up, and Allan stands up from his wheelchair and gets into the van with her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Jason Beghe]] as Allan Mann\n* [[John Pankow]] as Geoffrey Fisher\n* [[Kate McNeil]] as Melanie Parker\n* [[Joyce Van Patten]] as Dorothy Mann\n* [[Christine Forrest]] as Maryanne Hodges\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Dean Burbage\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Dr. John Wiseman\n* [[Janine Turner]] as Linda Aikman\n* [[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]] as Doc Williams\n* [[Tudi Wiggins]] as Esther Fry\n* [[Tom Quinn (actor)|Tom Quinn]] as Charlie Cunningham\n* [[Patricia Tallman]] as Party Guest\n* [[David Early]] as Anesthetist \n* Boo as Ella<ref name=ebert>{{cite web|url=https://rogerebert.com/reviews/monkey-shines-an-experiment-in-fear-1988|title=Monkey Shines: An Experiment in Fear Movie Review (1988)|author=Ebert, Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|date=July 29, 1988|website=RogerEbert.com|access-date=January 28, 2020}}</ref>\n** [[Frank Welker]] as Ella (vocalizations)\n}}\n\n==Analysis==\nFilm scholar Tony Williams interprets ''Monkey Shines'' as a \"complex film dealing with the ambiguous nature of human motivations,\" and humans' inability to deal with the consequences of their own desires.{{sfn|Williams|2015|p=154}}\n\nJournalist Michael Wilmington notes that the film's thematic weight rests in the presentation of the antagonistic monkey, Ella: \"The audience that rejects her as a little toy-terror--or the movie as a piece of icy misanthropy which perversely trashes women, animals and quadraplegics--misses the point.

First, the studio forced Romero to add a happy ending to the picture, a plot device which the director had long avoided in favor of more ambiguous endings; originally, Romero had intended to conclude the film in the same manner as its source novel, in which Allan does not recover from his accident.{{sfn|Williams|2015|p=161}} Second, after poor previews, the studio recut the film without Romero's knowledge to add a \"shock\" ending.{{sfn|Williams|2015|p=147}}\n\nAnother issue was the film's overall length, as Romero had completed a very long and involved shooting script that numbered over 240 pages. This resulted in a first cut of which 40 to 50% of the shot footage met the cutting room floor in the need to get the film reduced to a practical length. Upset with the way his project had been handled, Romero returned to independent films.\n\n;Alternate ending\nThe original intended ending of the film was unreleased until 2014, when it was included as a bonus feature on its debut [[Blu-ray]] release. In the original ending, prior to Dorothy and Geoffrey's deaths, Geoffrey's boss Dean Harold Burbage ([[Stephen Root]]) steals the remaining brain tissue serum and injects it into all of Geoffrey's remaining test monkeys. After Allan regains his ability to move on his own, Burbage is assaulted by animal rights protesters who had earlier attacked Geoffrey for experimenting on monkeys. Burbage insults them then returns to the lab where it's discovered that all of the remaining monkeys have completely taken control of his mind.\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''Monkey Shines'' was released theatrically in the United States on July 29, 1988, opening in 1,181 theaters.<ref name=bom>{{cite web|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|title=Monkey Shines|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl140871169/weekend/|access-date=January 28, 2020}}</ref> It grossed $1.9 million during its opening weekend.<ref name=bom/> It eventually went on to gross a total of $5.3 million in the United States over its 22-week theatrical run.<ref name=bom/>\n\n===Critical response===\n[[File:King Kong Fay Wray 1933.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|Several critics compared the portrayal of Ella to that of [[King Kong]]]]\nSeveral critics praised ''Monkey Shines'' for its portrayal of its [[philosophy|philosophical]] themes: David Kehr of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' heralded it as Romero's \"most complex and challenging creations...&nbsp;[Romero's] is a style of philosophical fiction that seems hardly to belong to the 20th Century at all, but rather to the 18th Century school of [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and [[Voltaire]].
