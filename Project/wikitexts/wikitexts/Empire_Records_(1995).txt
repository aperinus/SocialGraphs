The film follows a group of [[record store]] employees over the course of one exceptional day. The employees try to stop the store from being sold to a large chain, and learn about each other along the way. The film generated negative reviews and [[Box-office bomb|major losses]] at the domestic US box office at its release.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web |title=Empire Records |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=empirerecords.htm |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=2020-10-10}}</ref> It went on to become a cult hit, and several of its stars launched successful careers.<ref name=\"CultHitBomb\">{{cite web |date=September 2, 2014 |last=Petersen |first=Anne Helen |author-link=Anne Helen Petersen |title=How \"Empire Records\" Became The Unlikely Film Of A Generation |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/annehelenpetersen/how-empire-records-became-the-unlikely-film-of-a-generation |website=BuzzFeed |access-date=2020-10-01 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be limited to 700 words or less. -->\nAt independent record store Empire Records in [[Delaware]], employee Lucas has been tasked by store manager Joe with closing the store for the first time. While counting the day's receipts in Joe's office, he discovers the store is about to be sold and converted into a branch of ''Music Town'', a large national chain.\n\nDetermined to keep the store independent, Lucas hatches a plan, taking the day's cash receipts of approximately $9,000 to a casino in [[Atlantic City]] to quadruple it playing [[craps]]. Though successfully doubling the money on his first roll, he loses everything on the second.\n\nThe following morning, fellow Empire employees A.J. and Mark find Lucas, who confides in them about the previous night's events, just before riding off on his motorcycle. Joe arrives and quickly receives frantic phone calls about the missing deposit from both the bank and the store's owner, Mitchell Beck.\n\nOther employees arrive, including overachieving high school student Corey and her uninhibited best friend Gina. Hostile employee Deb, who has survived an apparent suicide attempt, also arrives. Deb then goes into the bathroom and shaves her head.  Upon Lucas' arrival, Joe confronts him about the missing deposit, and Lucas confirms the money was lost. Joe explains his anti-''Music Town'' plan to the employees &ndash; he had saved enough money to become part-owner of the store to save it, but will now be $9,000 short as he must cover the missing money with Mitchell.\n\nJoe is distracted from the crisis due to a major store event: Rex Manning Day. The washed-up 1980s pop idol is holding an autograph session at the store for fans of his latest album ''Back with More''. The unenthused staff mock both Manning and the event, and ultimately many of the fans showing up to meet him are either older women or gay men.\n\nThough detained by Joe in his office, Lucas nonetheless apprehends a belligerent young shoplifter who identifies himself only as \"[[Warren Beatty]]\". He is taken away by police but vows to return seeking revenge. Encouraged by Gina, Corey indulges her schoolgirl crush on Manning by attempting to seduce him, but winds up humiliated and dejected; A.J. then chooses this inopportune time to confess his love to Corey, which she rejects. After Gina and Corey argue, Gina has sex with Manning. When the staff discover this, A.J. attacks Manning, Gina reveals Corey's addiction to [[amphetamines]], Corey hysterically trashes the store, and Joe tells Manning to leave.\n\nDeb surprisingly attempts to cheer Corey up, and in return she holds a mock funeral for Deb with the whole staff. The shoplifter \"Warren\" returns with a gun (ultimately loaded with [[Blank (cartridge)|blanks]]), and Lucas defuses the situation by revealing that he himself was a troubled youth until he was taken in and saved by Joe. He in turn offers \"Warren\" a job at the store.\n\nAfter the police leave, Lucas admits defeat, and suggests confessing the truth about the missing money to Mitchell. However, the staff try to replace the missing money but can raise only $3,000. Suddenly inspired, Mark runs in front of the news crew covering the holdup, announcing on live TV a late-night benefit party at the store to \"Save the Empire\". An impromptu concert on the roof by Gina and Berko, another employee, raises funds so Joe can hand the money raised to Mitchell to buy the store.\n\nCorey finally finds a dejected A.J. on the roof fixing the Empire Records sign, and confesses that she loves him too. He decides to attend art school in Boston to be near her while she attends [[Harvard]]. They kiss, and the staff ends the long day with a dance party on the roof.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Anthony LaPaglia]] as Joe Reaves\n* [[Rory Cochrane]] as Lucas\n* [[Ethan Embry|Ethan Randall]] as Mark\n* [[Johnny Whitworth]] as A.J.\n* [[Robin Tunney]] as Debra\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger|Renee Zellweger]] as Gina\n* [[Liv Tyler]] as Corey Mason\n* [[Coyote Shivers]] as Berko\n* [[Brendan Sexton III|Brendan Sexton]] as Warren\n* [[Maxwell Caulfield]] as Rex Manning\n* [[Debi Mazar]] as Jane\n* [[James 'Kimo' Wills]] as Eddie\n* [[Ben Bode]] as Mitchell Beck\n}}\n\n==Production==\nNew Regency got into a bidding war with Warner Bros. over the script.
