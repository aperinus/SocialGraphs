It is based upon the 1977 [[Firefox (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Craig Thomas (author)|Craig Thomas]].\n\nThe film was set in Russia, but [[Cold War]] considerations had Eastwood's and Fritz Manes's [[Malpaso Company]] using [[Vienna]] and other locations in [[Austria]] to double for many of the [[Eurasia]]n story locations. One source indicates that the film was shot on a $21 million budget, the largest production budget ever for Malpaso.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=w6i25jxBIwcC&pg=PA337&lpg=PA337&dq=Firefox+(film)+budget&source=bl&ots=1HCoaSQo5a&sig=6lRe2h_xfmu1NBHF0RR_ve3jYRA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sRZzUfiEFOPn0gGO_IDIAg&ved=0CMcCEOgBMCY#v=onepage&q=Firefox%20(film)%20budget&f=false \"Firefox: Budget.\"] ''Clint: The Life and Legend.''

Former United States Air Force Major [[Mitchell Gant]], a Vietnam veteran, ex member of the [[Aggressor squadron]] and former [[prisoner of war]], infiltrates the Soviet Union, aided by his ability to speak [[Russian language|Russian]] (due to his having had a Russian mother) and a network of [[Soviet dissidents]], three of whom are key scientists working on the fighter itself. His goal is to steal the Firefox and fly it back to friendly territory for analysis.\n\nHowever, the [[KGB]] has got wind of the operation and is already looking for Gant. It is only through the dissidents that Gant remains one step ahead of the KGB and reaches the air base at Bilyarsk, where the Firefox prototype is under heavy guard. The dissidents working on the Firefox help Gant infiltrate the base. Pyotr Baranovich, one of the scientists, briefs Gant on the operation of the aircraft but warns him that there is a second prototype in the hangar that must be destroyed. The diversion will allow Gant to enter the hangar and escape with the first Firefox. Gant knocks out Lt. Colonel Yuri Voskov, a Soviet pilot assigned to take the first prototype on its maiden flight during a visit from the Soviet First Secretary. The scientists cause an explosive disruption, but the second prototype is undamaged. Baranovich is singled out for execution but manages to kill one of the guards with a concealed pistol before he and the other scientists are shot. Gant uses the commotion to enter the Firefox and fly it off the base.\n\nEvading the Soviets' attempts to stop him, Gant barely reaches the [[Arctic ice pack]] and lands, making a rendezvous with a US submarine whose crew refuels and rearms the aircraft. However, Gant's last-minute refusal to kill Voskov has consequences; the Soviet pilot flies the second prototype, with orders to intercept him at the [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]] area. Gant completes the rendezvous and is on the way home when Voskov engages him in a [[dogfight]]. After a long battle, Gant finally remembers to fire one of his rearward missiles and Voskov's plane is destroyed. Satisfied that there are no other Soviet forces chasing him, Gant begins his flight to safety.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- main and notable, in closing credits order --->\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Major Mitchell Gant\n* [[Freddie Jones]] as Kenneth Aubrey\n* [[David Huffman]] as Captain Buckholz\n* [[Warren Clarke]] as Pavel Upenskoy\n* [[Ronald Lacey]] as Dr. Maxim Ilyich Semelovsky\n* [[Kenneth Colley]] as Colonel Kontarsky\n* [[Klaus L\u00f6witsch]] as General Vladimirov\n* [[Nigel Hawthorne]] as Dr. Pyotr Baranovich\n* [[Stefan Schnabel]] as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|First Secretary]]\n* [[Thomas Hill (actor)|Thomas Hill]] as General Brown\n* [[Curt Lowens]] as Dr. Schuller\n* [[Clive Merrison]] as Major Lanyev\n* [[Kai Wulff]] as Lieutenant Colonel Yuri Voskov\n* [[Dimitra Arliss]] as Dr. Natalia Baranovich\n* [[Austin Willis]] as Walters\n* [[Michael Currie (actor)|Michael Currie]] as Captain Seerbacker\n* [[Alan Tilvern]] as Air Marshal Kutuzov\n* [[Oliver Cotton]] as Dmitri Priabin\n* [[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]] as Chief Inspector Tortyev\n* [[Wolf Kahler]] as [[List of Chairmen of the KGB|KGB Chairman]] [[Yuri Andropov]]\n\n==Production==\n[[File:MIG31-Firefox.JPG|thumb|Full-scale MiG 31 Firefox model used in the film \"Firefox\" parked at Van Nuys Airport, California in May 1982]]\nThe film was based on the creation of a \"mythical\" super fighter: the [[List of fictional aircraft#Mikoyan MiG-31 (fictional)|MiG-31 Firefox]]. The original Firefox from the novel was, cosmetically, nearly identical to the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25|MiG-25]] (which in reality is actually accurate).<ref>Schickel 1996, p. 375.</ref> The more intimidating version seen in the movie was created specifically for the film, and takes many of its design cues from the [[SR-71 Blackbird]]. In the sequel novel, ''[[Firefox Down]],'' the Firefox's appearance is described as matching the one in the film.<ref name=\"Thomas p. 29\"/> For filming, four large-scale replicas were created, along with one full-size model that had dimensions of 66 feet long, 44 feet wide, and 20 feet high. The full-size model was built from a radio station broadcast-antenna skeleton and was capable of taxiing at 30\u201340&nbsp;mph.<ref>Munn 1992, p. 187.</ref>\n\nFilming occurred in 1981 at a number of locations including [[Vienna, Austria]]; Montana; California; London and Greenland's [[Thule Air Force Base]].<ref name=\"Hughes198\"/><ref>Munn 1982, p. 185.</ref> Hollywood aerial cinematographer [[Clay Lacy]] flew second unit aerial sequences in a [[Learjet 23]] high-speed aerial platform, for scenes that were later integrated into the film.<ref>Carlson 2012, p. 257.</ref>\n\n[[Special effects]] supervisor [[John Dykstra]] pioneered a new technique for shooting the complex flying sequences, called [[Reverse bluescreen|reverse blue-screen photography]]. This involved coating the model with phosphorus paint and photographing it first with strong lighting against a black background and then with ultraviolet light to create the necessary male and female [[matte (filmmaking)|matte]]s to separate the foreground model and the background footage. This enabled the shiny black model to be photographed flying against a clear blue sky and gleaming white snow; compare this with traditional [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] technique used in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]].''<ref name=\"Thomas p. 29\">Thomas 1982, p. 29.</ref> The original scale model made by Gregory Jein used in the bluescreen work is now on display at the [[Warner Bros.
