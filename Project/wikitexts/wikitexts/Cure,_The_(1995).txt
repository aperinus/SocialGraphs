The film stars [[Brad Renfro]] and [[Joseph Mazzello]] and follows an unlikely friendship between two boys, one of whom is suffering from [[AIDS]]. When the boys hear of a possible cure for the disease, they set out on a quest to find it.\n\nThe film was distributed by [[Universal Pictures]] and was released to theaters on April 21, 1995. It was not a [[box office]] success, earning only $2.57 million.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web |title=The Cure (1995) |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=cure.htm |access-date=2019-04-23 |website=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref> Although ''The Cure'' received mixed reviews from critics, the performances of Mazzello and Renfro received  acclaim and both actors earned [[Young Artist Award]]s nominations.\n\nHorton received the Audience Award at the [[Cinekid Festival]] and Renfro won an award for Best Performance in a Drama Film at the first annual [[YoungStar Award]]s. The film also received a [[38th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nomination for its score by [[Dave Grusin]].\n\n==Plot==\nErik is an eleven-year-old [[loner]] who has just moved to a small town in [[Stillwater, Minnesota]]. Accompanying Erik is his newly divorced, emotionally abusive and neglectful workaholic mother, Gail. Erik and his neighbor Dexter, who contracted [[HIV]] through a [[blood transfusion]], become good friends despite initial mutual dislike and their differences, as Erik seeks the familial relationships he grew up without in Dexter and his mother Linda. Erik hides the friendship from his mother, knowing that she won't approve due to her own [[Serophobia|prejudice]] regarding [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]].\n\nGail discovers the friendship one night after Linda comes over to ask Erik about something Dexter ate in the boys' quest to find a natural cure for his disease. She furiously warns Linda to keep Dexter away, but Linda encourages the friendship. When the boys read an article in a tabloid about a doctor in distant [[New Orleans]] who claims to have found a [[cure]] for AIDS, they set out on their own down the [[Mississippi River]] with the hope of finding a means of saving Dexter's life.\n\nThe boys take a boat down the river with a bunch of degenerates who don't treat the pair very well. Eventually the boys steal their money and try to hitchhike the rest of the way. When the boatmen find out their money has been stolen, they locate the kids at a bus station and proceed to chase them until they reach a dead end of a dilapidated building. Erik draws a switchblade and one of the men draws a knife. Dexter suddenly grabs the knife from Erik and cuts his own hand. He threatens the boatman with his blood, saying that he has AIDS and could easily transfer the disease to him through the man's open wounds. This scares the men off. Dexter then realizes what he has done by directly exposing his blood to the outside environment. He suddenly feels sick, so Erik escorts him back to the bus station. Realizing that their journey must end if Dexter is to be treated, Erik resorts to calling Linda to have her pick the boys up when they reach Stillwater by bus.\n\nOnce they return, Dexter spends the rest of his time in the hospital. As his relationship with his mother has grown increasingly strained, Erik goes to stay with Linda who lets him visit Dexter. The boys joke and prank the doctors three times that Dexter has died, but when a third doctor arrives to check on him, Dexter has died for real. While driving Erik home, Linda notices a mother holding her young child while crossing the street. Reminded of her own son, she pulls over and breaks down crying. Erik apologizes to her, saying that he should have tried harder to find a cure. Linda, taken aback by his comment, embraces Erik, explaining that he was the happiest thing in Dexter's difficult life. Upon their arrival at home, a furious Gail confronts the pair. When Gail starts to hit Erik, Linda quickly intervenes, angrily and tearfully informs her of Dexter's death, and demands that she allow Erik to attend the funeral and never hit him again and threatens to report her to [[child protective services]]. Gail guiltily complies.\n\nAt Dexter's funeral, Erik places one of his shoes in the coffin and takes one of Dexter's to let sail down the river. This pays homage to an earlier moment in their trip when Dexter, who was having nightmares, was given one of Erik's sneakers to hold as a reminder that he's always by his side.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joseph Mazzello]] as Dexter Evans\n* [[Brad Renfro]] as Erik\n* [[Diana Scarwid]] as Gail\n* [[Annabella Sciorra]] as Linda\n* Aeryk Egan as Tyler\n* [[Nicky Katt]] as Pony\n* [[Renee Humphrey]] as Angle\n* [[Bruce Davison]] as Dr. Jensen\n* Peter Moore as Male Nurse\n* Andrew Broder as Tyler's Friend #1\n* [[Jeremy Howard (actor)|Jeremy Howard]] as Tyler's Friend #2\n* [[John Carroll Lynch]] as Skipper #1\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\nThe script for the film was written in 1993 by Robert Kuhn.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite magazine |last=Cagle |first=Jess |date=April 28, 1995 |title=Headaches Over 'The Cure' |url=https://ew.com/article/1995/04/28/headaches-over-cure/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623142220/https://ew.com/article/1995/04/28/headaches-over-cure/ |archive-date=2015-06-23 |access-date=2022-07-30 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |language=en}}</ref> Although studio executives were initially skittish about the film's commercial prospects due to its subject matter, the script became a hot property when [[Steven Spielberg]]'s production company [[Amblin Entertainment]] showed interest in buying it.<ref name=\":3\" /> A resulting bidding war ended with a million-dollar sale to [[Eric Eisner (lawyer)|Eric Eisner]] of [[Island World|Island Pictures]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nEisner sought out [[Martin Brest]] to direct the film, but Brest declined as he was unsure he could get the necessary performances out of young actors.<ref name=\":3\" /> Other directors who declined were [[Sydney Pollack]], [[Rob Reiner]] and [[Paul Brickman]].<ref name=\":3\" /> [[Universal Pictures]], who had signed on to distribute the film, expressed concern that no director had yet come on board, so Eisner halved the film's initial $20 million budget and hired [[Peter Horton]] to direct.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWhile the script circulated through talent agencies for the casting process, some industry figures criticized the script's irresponsibility in its treatment of homosexuality and accused it of [[homophobia]].<ref name=\":3\" /> Particular criticism was directed towards scenes in which neighborhood bullies insult Dexter, calling him [[Faggot (slang)|gay slurs]] while no other characters attempt to neutralize the insults.<ref name=\":3\" /> Horton attempted to address this problem through the character of Jerry, a gay male nurse played by actor Peter Moore. Commenting on Jerry's character, journalist Jess Cagle opined, \"Jerry's homosexuality is apparent only in a slight part of Moore's performance.
