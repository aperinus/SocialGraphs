Two surviving factions, the New Territories and the Federal Republics, have been at war for 40 years. Finally, they have agreed to peace terms thanks to the efforts of the Central Union (CU). One of the security experts for the CU, Anne (Bock), decodes the encrypted messages of her boss, only to discover that one of the security zones has suffered a deadly contamination. Mysteriously, she dies shortly thereafter, leaving her soldier husband Leo (Phelps) devastated.<ref name=brennan/>\n\nTo recuperate, Leo is assigned to guard duty at the border outpost named Zone 39. The remainder of the film deals with Leo's struggle to cope with isolation and the death of his wife.<ref name=brennan/> She appears to him in hallucinations, perhaps brought on by the tranquillizers he has been taking.<ref name=ruffles2004/>\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Peter Phelps]] ...

One was the way in which a person deals with grief, the loss of a loved on. I truly believe that someone doesn't die until we stop thinking about that person. I think once we forget that person, once that person ceases to live in our memories, then that person is truly dead. Often it takes a long time for that person to truly die in people's hearts. I wanted to explore this theme in an environment that I think we're heading towards, one of being like a society that is particularly unfriendly to the individual and particularly isolates the individual and controls that individual.<ref>[http://www.signis.net/malone/tiki-index.php?page=John+Tatoulis&bl \"Interview with John Tatoulis\", ''Signis'', 20 May 1997].
