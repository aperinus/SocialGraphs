The film stars [[David Niven]], [[Peter Sellers]], [[Robert Wagner]], [[Capucine]] and [[Claudia Cardinale]].\n\nThe film was produced by [[Martin Jurow]] and was initially released on December 18, 1963 in Italy followed by the United States release on March 18, 1964.

This huge [[Pink diamond|pink gem]] has an unusual flaw: by looking deeply into the stone, one perceives a tiny discoloration resembling a leaping panther. Twenty years later, Dala (now played by [[Claudia Cardinale]]) has been forced into exile following her father's death and the subsequent military takeover of her country. The new government declares her precious diamond the property of the people and petitions the [[International Court of Justice|World Court]] to determine ownership. However, Dala refuses to relinquish it.\n\nDala goes on holiday at an exclusive ski resort in [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]]. Also staying there is English playboy Sir Charles Lytton ([[David Niven]])&mdash;who leads a secret life as a [[Gentleman thief|gentleman jewel thief]] called \"the Phantom\"&mdash;and has his eyes on the Pink Panther. His brash American nephew George ([[Robert Wagner]]) arrives at the resort unexpectedly. George is really a playboy drowning in gambling debts, but poses as a recent college graduate about to enter the [[Peace Corps]] so his uncle continues to support his lavish lifestyle.\n\nOn the Phantom's trail is French police detective Inspector [[Inspector Clouseau|Jacques Clouseau]] ([[Peter Sellers]]), whose wife Simone ([[Capucine]]) is having an affair with Sir Charles. She has become rich by acting as a fence for the Phantom under the nose of her amorous but oblivious husband. She dodges him while trying to avoid her lover's playboy nephew, who has decided to make the seductive older woman his latest conquest. Sir Charles has grown enamored of Dala and is ambivalent about carrying out the heist. The night before their departure, George accidentally learns of his uncle's criminal activities.\n\nDuring a [[costume party]] at Dala's [[villa]] in Rome, Sir Charles and his nephew separately attempt to steal the diamond, only to find it already missing from the safe. The Inspector discovers both men at the crime scene. They escape during the confusion of the evening's climactic fireworks display. A frantic car chase through the streets of Rome ensues. Sir Charles and George are both arrested after all the vehicles collide with one another in the town square.\n\nLater, Simone informs Dala that Sir Charles wished to call off the theft and asks her to help in his defense. Dala then reveals that she stole the diamond herself, to avoid turning it over to the new government of her homeland. However, the Princess is also smitten with Sir Charles and has a plan to save him from prison. At the trial, the defense calls as their sole witness a surprised Inspector Clouseau. The barrister ([[John Le Mesurier]]) asks a series of questions that suggest Clouseau himself could be the Phantom. An unnerved Clouseau pulls out his handkerchief to wipe the perspiration from his brow, and the jewel drops from it.\n\nAs Clouseau is taken away to prison, he is mobbed by a throng of enamored women. Watching from a distance, Simone expresses regret, but Sir Charles reassures her that when the Phantom strikes again, Clouseau will be exonerated. Sir Charles invites George to join them on the Phantom's next heist in South America. Meanwhile, on the way to prison, the Roman police express their envy that Clouseau is now desired by so many women. They ask him with obvious admiration how he committed all of those crimes; Clouseau considers his newfound fame and replies, \"Well, you know... it wasn't easy.\"\n\nThe film ends after the police car carrying Clouseau to prison runs over a traffic warden&mdash;the cartoon Pink Panther from the animated opening credits. He gets back up as we hear the crash that was coming out from the police car, holding a card that reads \"THEND\" and swipes the letters to read \"THE END.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Capucine The Pink Panther.jpg\n| width1    = 170\n| caption1  = [[Capucine]] as Simone Clouseau in the trailer for the film\n| image2    = Claudia Cardinale 1963.jpg\n| width2    = 167\n| caption2  = [[Claudia Cardinale]] as Princess Dala in the trailer for the film\n}}\n\n* [[David Niven]] as Sir Charles Lytton\n* [[Peter Sellers]] as Inspector [[Inspector Clouseau|Jacques Clouseau]]\n* [[Robert Wagner]] as George Lytton, Sir Charles' nephew\n* [[Capucine]] as Simone Clouseau, Inspector Clouseau's wife\n* [[Claudia Cardinale]] as Princess Dala\n* [[Colin Gordon]] as Tucker\n* [[Brenda de Banzie]] as Angela Dunning\n* [[John Le Mesurier]] as Defense attorney\n* [[James Lanphier]] as Saloud\n* Guy Thomajan as Artoff\n* [[Fran Jeffries]] as ski lodge singer\n* [[Michael Trubshawe]] as Felix Townes, novelist\n* [[Riccardo Billi]] as Aristotle Sarajos, Greek shipowner\n* Meri Welles as Monica Fawn, Hollywood starlet\n* [[Martin Miller (actor)|Martin Miller]] as Pierre Luigi, photographer\n* [[Gale Garnett]], voice of Princess Dala ''(uncredited)''<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/19551/The-Pink-Panther/articles.html] {{dead link|date=November 2021}}</ref>\n\n'''Cast notes'''\n*Niven portrayed \"[[A.

If not for Sellers' hilarious pratfalls, ''The Pink Panther'' could be mistaken for a luxuriant caper movie like ''[[Topkapi (film)|Topkapi]]''&nbsp;... which is precisely what makes the movie so funny.
