Feldman]], and [[Adam Schroeder]], and written by Niccol. The film stars [[Jim Carrey]] as Truman Burbank, a man who grew up living an ordinary life that\u2014unbeknownst to him\u2014takes place on a large set populated by actors for a television show about him. The supporting cast includes [[Laura Linney]], [[Ed Harris]], [[Noah Emmerich]], [[Natascha McElhone]], [[Holland Taylor]], [[Paul Giamatti]], and [[Brian Delate]].\n\nUnlike the finished product, Niccol's [[spec script]] was more of a [[science-fiction]] [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], with the story set in [[New York City]]. [[Scott Rudin]] purchased the script and set up production at [[Paramount Pictures]]. [[Brian De Palma]] was to direct before Weir signed as director, making the film for $60&nbsp;million\u2014$20&nbsp;million less than the original estimate. Niccol rewrote the script while the crew was waiting for Carrey to sign. The majority of filming took place at [[Seaside, Florida]], a master-[[planned community]] located in the [[Florida Panhandle]].\n\n''The Truman Show'' held its world premiere in Los Angeles on June 1, 1998, and was released in North America on June 5. The film was a financial success, debuting to critical acclaim, and earned numerous nominations at the [[71st Academy Awards]], [[56th Golden Globe Awards]], [[52nd British Academy Film Awards]], and [[25th Saturn Awards]]. ''The Truman Show'' has been analyzed as an exploration of [[simulated reality]], [[existentialism]], [[surveillance]], [[religion]], [[metaphilosophy]], [[privacy]], and [[reality television]], and described as a [[Hybrid genre|genre-blending]] that features elements of [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|dystopian fiction]], [[metafiction]], [[psychological drama]], [[romantic comedy]], [[satire]], and [[social science fiction]].\n\n== Plot ==\nTruman Burbank is the unsuspecting star of ''The Truman Show'', a [[reality television]] program filmed 24/7 through thousands of hidden cameras and broadcast to a worldwide audience. Christof, the show's creator and executive producer, seeks to capture Truman's authentic emotions and give audiences a relatable everyman. Truman has been the star of the show since he was born and the studio officially adopted him.\n\nAs Truman was selected from birth following an [[unwanted pregnancy]], Christof claims that Truman came to be adopted not just by the show, but by the whole \"world\". Truman's hometown of Seahaven Island is a complete set built within an enormous dome, populated by crew members and actors who highlight the [[product placement]]s that generate revenue for the show. The elaborate set allows Christof to control almost every aspect of Truman's life, including the weather.\n\nTo prevent Truman from discovering his false reality, Christof manufactures scenarios that dissuade Truman's desire for exploration, such as the \"death\" of his father in a sea storm to instill [[aquaphobia]], and by constantly broadcasting and printing messages of the dangers of traveling and the virtues of staying home. However, Christof cannot predict all of Truman's actions. During his college years, Truman was intended to fall in love with and marry co-student Meryl, but fell for Sylvia, an [[Extra (acting)|extra]].\n\nAlthough Sylvia was quickly removed from the show before she could disclose its nature to Truman, he continues to remember her, and secretly dreams of a life with Sylvia outside of his marriage to Meryl. To this end, he seeks to travel to [[Fiji]], where he was told Sylvia's family moved. In the real world, Sylvia is a part of \"Free Truman\", an activist group that seeks to cancel the show and have Truman released.\n\nAs the show approaches its 30th anniversary, Truman begins discovering unusual elements, such as a spotlight falling out of the sky in front of his house and a radio channel that precisely describes his movements. These events are punctuated by the reappearance of his father, who had infiltrated the set, with the crew believing the actor was somehow recast. Truman begins questioning his life and realizes that the city somehow revolves around him. Meryl's stress from attempting to uphold the charade in the face of Truman's growing skepticism and hostility causes their marriage to deteriorate.\n\nOne day, Truman takes Meryl by surprise by going on an impromptu road trip, but increasingly implausible emergencies block their way. During an argument ignited by Meryl attempting to advertise a product, Truman determines that Meryl is a part of the conspiracy and holds her at knife-point; she [[breaking character|breaks character]] and is taken off the show. Hoping to bring Truman back to a controllable state, Christof re-introduces Truman's father to the show properly, under the guise of having [[amnesia|lost his memory]] after the boating accident. This helps the show regain the ratings lead with audiences, and Truman seems to return to his routines, except he begins sleeping in his basement. One night, Truman secretly disappears through a makeshift tunnel in his basement, forcing Christof to temporarily suspend the broadcast for the first time in its history. Audiences around the world are captivated by this unexpected event, and record numbers tune in.\n\nChristof orders a citywide search for Truman and is soon forced to \"cue the sun\" and break the production's day-night cycle to optimize the search. Christof discovers Truman sailing away from Seahaven on a small boat, having conquered his fear of water. He resumes the transmission and, unable to fetch Truman by boat, creates a violent storm in an attempt to capsize Truman\u2019s boat. After nearly drowning Truman but failing to break his spirit, Christof ends the storm. Truman continues to sail until his boat strikes the wall of the dome.\n\nInitially horrified, Truman discovers a nearby staircase leading to an exit door. As Truman contemplates leaving his world, Christof speaks directly to Truman through a speaker system and tries to persuade him to stay, claiming that there is no more truth in the real world than in his artificial one, where he would have nothing to fear. After a moment of reflection, Truman says his catchphrase: \"In case I don't see you... good afternoon, good evening, and good night\", bows to his audience and exits. The viewers celebrate his escape, and Sylvia races to greet him. Christof's supervisors finally end the program on a shot of the open exit door, leaving Christof to mourn over the truth of his defeat. Truman's fans\u2014the viewers of the show\u2014cheer upon his successful escape and then, after transmission ceases, ask what else is on television.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as Truman Burbank\n:Chosen out of six unwanted pregnancies to be the first child legally adopted by a corporation, Truman is unaware that his daily life is broadcast continuously worldwide. He has a job in the insurance business and a wife, but he eventually notices that his environment is not what it seems to be. [[Robin Williams]] was considered for the role. Still, Weir cast Carrey after seeing him in ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'' because Carrey's performance reminded him of [[Charlie Chaplin]].<ref name=\"pro\">{{cite magazine |author=Svetkey, Benjamin |title=Jim Carrey's serious turn in The Truman Show |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |date=June 5, 1998 |url=https://ew.com/article/1998/06/05/jim-carreys-serious-turn-truman-show/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200217162436/https://ew.com/article/1998/06/05/jim-carreys-serious-turn-truman-show/ |archive-date=February 17, 2020 |access-date=March 16, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> Carrey took the opportunity to proclaim himself as a dramatic actor, rather than being [[Typecasting|typecast]] in comedic roles.<ref>{{cite news | author = Weinraub, Bernard | title = Director Tries a Fantasy As He Questions Reality | work = The New York Times | date = May 21, 1998 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E0D71539F932A15756C0A96E958260 | access-date = April 1, 2008 | archive-date = July 13, 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210713225146/https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/21/movies/director-tries-a-fantasy-as-he-questions-reality.html | url-status = live }}</ref> Carrey, who was then normally paid $20&nbsp;million per film, agreed to do ''The Truman Show'' for $12&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"12mil\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/new-truman-villain-harris-1117435072/|title=New ''Truman'' villain: Harris|date=April 7, 1997|work=Variety|author=Busch, Anita M.|access-date=March 27, 2017|archive-date=March 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327080406/http://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/new-truman-villain-harris-1117435072/|url-status=live}}</ref> Carrey also said it was the fastest role that he ever accepted.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://screenrant.com/the-truman-show-jim-carrey-cast-fastest-response/ | title=The Truman Show is the Fastest Jim Carrey Ever Said Yes to a Role | website=[[Screen Rant]] | date=April 4, 2022 }}</ref> Carrey and Weir initially found working together on set difficult (Carrey's contract gave him the power to demand rewrites), but Weir was impressed with Carrey's [[improvisation]]al skills, and the two became more interactive.<ref name=\"pro\" />{{failed verification|date=August 2021}} The scene in which Truman declares \"this planet Trumania of the Burbank galaxy\" to the bathroom mirror was Carrey's idea.<ref name=\"part2\" />\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Hannah Gill, acting as Meryl Burbank, Truman's wife\n:A nurse at the local hospital. Since the show relies on [[product placement]] for revenue, Meryl regularly shows off various items that she has recently \"purchased\", one of the many oddities that makes Truman question his life. Her role is to act the part of Truman's wife and ultimately to have a child by him, despite her reluctance to accomplish either. She is written off the show after a heated argument with Truman, which is portrayed as a divorce.

Emmerich has said, \"My character is in a lot of pain. He feels really guilty about deceiving Truman. He's had a serious drug addiction for many years. Been in and out of rehab.\" Very little of this is shown in the finished film, but several deleted scenes depict Louis actively expressing guilt over Truman's situation, and in one sequence, he spots Truman during his escape and purposely says nothing. His name is an [[Amalgamation (names)|amalgamation]] of two jazz musicians, [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[John Coltrane]], and in one scene, he plays the trumpet.\n* [[Natascha McElhone]] as Sylvia, playing Lauren Garland, Truman's college schoolmate\n:Sylvia was hired to play a background [[Extra (acting)|extra]], a fellow student at Truman's college, named Lauren. Unlike the other actors who are in it to get paid, she actually believes that Truman should be free from his false reality rather than be locked up like an animal. She became romantically involved with Truman and tried to reveal the truth to him about his life, but was removed from the show before she could do so. She then becomes a protester against ''The Truman Show'', urging Christof to release its lead.\n* [[Holland Taylor]] as Alanis Montclair, playing Truman's mother Angela Burbank\n* [[Brian Delate]] as Walter Moore, playing Truman's father Kirk Burbank\n:Walter's character on The Truman Show\u2014Truman's \"father\", Kirk\u2014is [[Kill off|\"killed off\"]] by Christof during Truman's childhood, supposedly dying in a rainstorm while the two are on a boat out at sea. This trauma is designed to instill a pathological fear of water that will keep Truman from escaping the show's set, an artificial indoor island. Walter later sneaks inside Seahaven to revive his career by disguising himself as an extra. After Truman spots him, his character is reintroduced on the show by using [[amnesia]] to explain his absence.\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Simeon, a control room director\n* [[Peter Krause]] as Laurence, Truman's boss\n* [[Harry Shearer]] as Mike Michaelson, a TV [[Talk show|talk-show]] host\n*[[Philip Baker Hall]] as a Network Executive\n* [[Joel McKinnon Miller]] as a garage attendant\n\n==Production==\n[[File:House from The Truman Show film.jpg|thumb|This house in [[Seaside, Florida]], served as Truman's home.

And, like ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'', and every other reality show on the air, none of his environment is actually real.\" He deemed it an eerie coincidence that ''Big Brother'' made its debut a year after the film's release, and he also compared the film to the 2003 program ''[[The Joe Schmo Show]]'': \"Unlike Truman, [[Matt Kennedy Gould|Matt Gould]] could see the cameras, but all of the other contestants were paid actors, playing the part of various reality-show stereotypes. While Matt eventually got all of the prizes in the rigged contest, the show's central running joke was in the same existential ballpark as ''The Truman Show''.\"<ref name=\"Popularmechanics\">{{cite magazine|author=Sofge, Erik |title=The 10 Most Prophetic Sci-Fi Movies Ever |magazine=Popular Mechanics |date=March 28, 2008 |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/reviews/4256186.html?page=7 |access-date=March 31, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331141336/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/reviews/4256186.html?page=7 |archive-date=March 31, 2008 }}</ref> Weir declared, \"There has always been this question: Is the audience getting dumber?

Only those who belonged to this island knew how to navigate their way through the treacherous openings safely and unharmed. This situation is similar to ''The Truman Show'' because there are limited entryways into the world that Truman knows. Truman does not belong to this utopia into which he has been implanted, and childhood trauma rendered him frightened of the prospect of ever leaving this small community. Utopian models of the past tended to be full of like-minded individuals who shared much in common, comparable to More's ''Utopia'' and real-life groups such as the [[Shakers]] and the [[Oneida Community]].<ref name=\"Robert\" /> It is clear that the people in Truman's world are like-minded in their common effort to keep him oblivious to reality. The suburban \"[[picket fence]]\" appearance of the show's set is reminiscent of the \"[[American Dream]]\" of the 1950s. The \"American Dream\" concept in Truman's world serves as an attempt to keep him happy and ignorant.<ref name=\"Robert\">Beuka, Robert.
