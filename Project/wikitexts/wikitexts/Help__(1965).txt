The second film starring the Beatles following Lester's ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', ''Help!'' sees the group struggle to protect Starr from a sinister [[thugee|eastern cult]] and a pair of mad scientists, all of whom are obsessed with obtaining a sacrificial ring sent to him by a fan.<ref name=\"Beatles.com\">{{cite web|title=Help!|url=http://www.beatles.com/#/films/Help|publisher=Beatles.com|access-date=2 September 2011|archive-date=15 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915050205/http://beatles.com/#/films/Help|url-status=live}}</ref> The soundtrack was released as the band's fifth studio album [[Help!|under the same name]].\n\n''Help!'' had its Royal World Premiere at the [[London Pavilion]] Theatre in the [[West End of London]] on 29 July 1965 in the presence of [[Princess Margaret]], Countess of Snowdon and the [[Antony Charles Robert Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon|Earl of Snowdon]]. While not reviewed at the time with the same high level of admiration as their first film, ''Help!'' is now credited with influencing the development of [[music videos]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:The Beatles Trailer USHelp.jpg|left|thumb|225x225px|Screenshot of [[the Beatles]] in ''Help!'']]\nAn [[Eastern world|eastern]] [[cult]] (a parody of the [[Thuggee]] cult) is about to sacrifice a woman to their [[goddess]], Kaili. They notice that she is not wearing the sacrificial ring. Instead, [[Ringo Starr]], drummer of the Beatles, has the ring, sent to him by the intended victim, who is a fan of the Beatles. Determined to retrieve the ring and sacrifice the girl, the chief priest, Clang, several cult members, and high priestess Ahme leave for London. After failed attempts to steal the ring without Ringo noticing, they confront him in an Indian restaurant. Ringo learns that he will be the next sacrifice if he does not give up the ring. However, the ring is stuck on his finger and he cannot take it off.\n\nThe Beatles are chased around London by members of the cult. After a jeweller fails to cut the ring off, the band resorts to the bumbling efforts of a mad scientist and his assistant; when his equipment has no effect on the ring, the scientist decides that he must somehow acquire it. Amhe comes to the Beatles' rescue, and tries to shrink Ringo's finger to get the ring off with ease, but the cult and the scientists ambush the band's home, causing Ahme to drop the syringe in shock, shrinking Paul instead.\n\nThe band runs to the Austrian Alps and narrowly escapes a trap there, thanks to Ahme, who is secretly aiding the Beatles. To stay safe, they ask for protection from Scotland Yard. They are hidden in Buckingham Palace, narrowly avoiding capture by the scientist. Later at a pub, Clang sets a trap for Ringo involving a trap door and a tiger.\n\nThen they flee to the Bahamas, followed by the police officers, the scientist, and the cult members. After Ringo is nearly captured, the police have the other Beatles pose as him in order to ensnare the cult members. Despite their best efforts, however, the scientist catches Ringo and hides him aboard a boat where he intends to cut off his finger to get the ring.  Ahme rescues Ringo by giving the scientist a shrinking solution in exchange. The two of them dive into the ocean to escape, but Ringo cannot swim and they are both captured by Clang and his followers.\n\nIn the end, when Ringo is about to be sacrificed on the beach, the ring suddenly comes off. He puts the ring on Clang's finger, who is then chased by his own cult as the song \"Help!\" plays.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[John Lennon]]     as himself\n* [[Paul McCartney]]  as himself\n* [[George Harrison]] as himself\n* [[Ringo Starr]]     as himself\n* [[Eleanor Bron]]    as Ahme\n* [[Leo McKern]]      as Clang\n* [[John Bluthal]]    as Bhuta\n* [[Patrick Cargill]] as the Superintendent\n* [[Victor Spinetti]] as Foot\n* [[Roy Kinnear]]     as Algernon\n* [[Alfie Bass]]      as Doorman\n* [[Warren Mitchell]] as Abdul\n* [[Peter Copley]] as Jeweller\n* [[Bruce Lacey]] as Lawnmower\n* Durra as Belly Dancer\n* [[Mal Evans]]       as Channel Swimmer (uncredited)\n* [[Gretchen Franklin]] as Neighbour (uncredited)\n* [[Dandy Nichols]] as Neighbour (uncredited)\n* [[Jeremy Lloyd]] as Restaurant Patron (uncredited)\n* [[John Louis Mansi]] as Priest / Thug\n* Viviane Ventura as Girl on the sacrificial altar (uncredited)\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nAccording to interviews conducted with [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]] for ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'', director Richard Lester was given a larger budget for this film than he had for ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', thanks to the commercial success of the latter. Thus, this feature film was in colour and was shot on several overseas locations. It was also given a more extensive musical score than ''A Hard Day's Night'', provided by a full orchestra, and including pieces of well known classical music: [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'', Act III prelude, [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[1812 Overture]]'', [[Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] (\"Ode to Joy\"), and, during the end credits and with their own comic vocal interpretation, [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''[[The Barber of Seville|Barber of Seville]]'' overture. The original title for the film \u2013 only changed to ''Help!'' very near to its release \u2013 was ''Eight Arms to Hold You''.<ref>Matthews, Brian.\"Part 7,\" ''The Beatles Story'' (BBC, 1973).</ref> As such, [[Capitol Records]]' original pressings of the \"[[Ticket to Ride (song)|Ticket to Ride]]\" single feature the subheading: ''From the United Artists release \"Eight Arms to Hold You\"''.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\n''Help!'' was shot in London, [[Salisbury Plain]], the [[Austria]]n [[Alps]], [[New Providence Island]] and [[Paradise Island]] in the Bahamas, and [[Twickenham Film Studios]], beginning in the Bahamas on 23 February 1965. Starr commented in ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'' that they were in the Bahamas for the hot weather scenes, and therefore had to wear light clothing even though it was rather cold. Tony Bramwell, the assistant to Beatles manager Brian Epstein, stated in his book ''A Magical Mystery Tour'' that Epstein chose the Bahamas for tax reasons. According to ''The Beatles Anthology'', during the restaurant sequence filmed in early April, Harrison began to discover [[India]]n-style music, which would be a key element in future songs such as \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)|Norwegian Wood]]\". Filming finished on 14 April at Ailsa Avenue in [[Twickenham]].{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\nThe ski scenes were shot at [[Obertauern]], a small village in Austria. One reason this location was chosen was that the stars of the film were less likely to be recognised there than at one of the larger resorts with many British tourists. The Beatles were in Obertauern for about two weeks in March 1965 along with a film crew of around 60 people. Locals served as ski stunt doubles for the Beatles, who stayed at the hotel \"Edelweiss\". Most of the crew were based in the hotel Marieta, where one night the Beatles gave an impromptu concert on the occasion of a director's assistant's birthday. This was the only time they ever played on stage in Austria.<ref name=FAS>{{cite news | last =  Kast| first = G\u00fcnter| title = Hi-Hi-Hilfe! | newspaper = Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung | location = Travel Section | pages = 4 | language = de | date = 4 January 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe Beatles did not particularly enjoy filming ''Help!'',<ref>{{Cite book|last=Reiter|first=Roland|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1049910288|title=The Beatles on Film : Analysis of Movies, Documentaries, Spoofs and Cartoons.|date=2015|publisher=Transcript Verlag|isbn=3-8394-0885-7|location=Bielefeld|pages=73|oclc=1049910288}}</ref> nor were they pleased with the end product.

It was a precursor to the [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'']] \"Pow!  Wow!\" on TV \u2013 that kind of stuff. But [Lester] never explained it to us. Partly, maybe, because we hadn't spent a lot of time together between ''A Hard Day's Night'' and ''Help!'', and partly because we were smoking marijuana for breakfast during that period. Nobody could communicate with us, it was all glazed eyes and giggling all the time. In our own world.

Afterwards they were hesitant to begin another film project, and ''Help!'' was their last full-length scripted theatrical film. The Beatles saw the 1968 animated film ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' (in which their characters were voiced by actors, and they themselves made only a token appearance) as a favourable way to complete their commitment to [[United Artists]] for a third film. Many fans have assumed that the cartoon did not satisfy the contract, but ''[[Let It Be (1970 film)|Let It Be]]'' (1970) was the film not connected to the original three-picture deal.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hieronimus |first1=Robert |title=Inside the Yellow submarine: the making of the Beatles' animated classic |year=2002 |publisher=Krause |location=Iola, WI |isbn=0-87349-360-5 |pages=32\u201333}}</ref>\n\n===Inspiration===\nThe Beatles said the film was inspired by the classic [[Marx Brothers]] film ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'';<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MRpqWHwLZNoC&pg=PT377 |title=Shout!: The Beatles in Their Generation |page=1377 |isbn=978-0-7432-5378-9 |year=2011 |last=Norman |first=Phillip |publisher=Simon and Schuster |access-date=2011-03-08}}</ref> it was also directly satirical of the [[James Bond]] series of films.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_8Ob1bL_ongC&pg=PA102 |page=102 |title=Reading the Beatles: Cultural Studies, Literary Criticism, and the Fab Four |year=2012 |last=Womack |first=Kenneth |author2=Davis, Todd F. |isbn=978-0-7914-8196-7 |publisher=SUNY Press |access-date=2011-03-08}}</ref> At the time of the original release of ''Help!'', its distributor, [[United Artists]], also held the rights to the Bond series.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\nThe humour of the film is strongly influenced by the abstract humour of ''[[The Goon Show]]'', in which the director had personal and direct experience in the conversion of the radio format to television, and personal working experience with [[Peter Sellers]] in particular.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HESlHkg_pRoC&pg=PA54 |title=John Lennon Imagined: Cultural History of a Rock Star |page=54 |isbn=0-8204-6788-X |year=2004 |last=M\u00e4kel\u00e4 |first=Janne |publisher=Peter Lang |access-date=2011-03-08}}</ref> Beatles recording producer [[George Martin]] had also produced records for the ''Goon Show'' team. McCartney has always said that the Beatles' style of humour was taken from the ''Goon Show''. Many of the film's concepts are derived from ''Goon Show''s, such as the presence of wild animals, music, [[fourth wall]]-breaking jokes and abstractions such as the closing statement that concludes the film.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\n===Working title===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2019}}\nAmong the original working titles for the film were ''Beatles Phase II'' and ''Eight Arms to Hold You''. The latter title was printed on the single \"Ticket to Ride\" as an upcoming film. Because of this, the phrase has been used as a title for an album by [[Veruca Salt]] and for songs by [[the Goonies]] and by the Brittles, a Beatles-pastiche band.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\n''Help!'' was settled on as the film's title in April, leading Lennon to write the song \"Help!\" that same night. The official title was announced on 14 April. Aside from ''Eight Arms to Hold You'', this title won over suggestions from Harrison (''Who's Been Sleeping in My Porridge'') and United Artists producer [[Walter Shenson]] (''The Day the Clowns Collapsed'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Miles|first=Barry|author-link=Barry Miles|title=The Beatles Diary Volume 1: The Beatles Years|year=2001|publisher=Omnibus Press|location=London|isbn=0-7119-8308-9|page=194}}</ref> The Beatles had also suggested ''High-Heeled Knickers'', a play on the title of [[Tommy Tucker (singer)|Tommy Tucker]]'s 1964 hit song \"[[Hi-Heel Sneakers|High-Heeled Sneakers]]\".<ref name=\"Robertson/MojoSpecial p 17\">{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=John|year=2002|chapter=''Help!'': The End of the Beginning|title=Mojo Special Limited Edition: 1000 Days That Shook the World (The Psychedelic Beatles \u2013 April 1, 1965 to December 26, 1967)|location=London|publisher=Emap|page=17|title-link=Mojo (magazine)#Special editions}}</ref>\n\n===Michael Peto photographs===\nThe photographer [[Michael Peto]] was commissioned in 1965 to take still photographs during the making of the film; these became known for their candid and expressive quality.

The second side consisted of other new Beatles songs recorded at the same time or shortly afterwards. The US album, released by Capitol Records, includes the seven film tracks along with instrumental soundtrack songs orchestrated by Ken Thorne.  In addition, the US ''Help!'' opens with a hidden track stylised as a satirical \"James Bond Theme\" before the title track. Early pressings of the US version of the album ''[[1962\u20131966]]'' include this hidden track banded as \"Help!\", and later pressings, when the UK catalogue was made the official and only catalogue of Beatles albums, omit it.  The end credits are played over Rossini's \"The Barber of Seville\".\n\n==Critical response==\n\nUpon its release, reviews for ''Help!'' were mixed.  The ''[[Daily Express]]''{{'}}s reviewer found Lester's direction \"a joy to  watch\" and called the Beatles \"the closest thing to the Marx Brothers since the Marx Brothers\". By contrast, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', Britain's best-selling newspaper at the time, said ''Help!'' relied too heavily on \"the likeable vacant grin of John Lennon, the smooth charm of Paul, the long-haired good looks of George, and the darkly villainous looks of the Long-Nosed One [Ringo Starr]\", and that these qualities were insufficient to carry a film.<ref name=\"Robertson/MojoSpecial p 17\" /> In his contemporary review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', film critic [[Bosley Crowther]] stated: \"It's a fiasco of farcical whimseys that are thrown together in this film \u2013 a clutter of mechanical gimmicks and madcap chases&nbsp;... Funny? Exciting? Different? Well, there's nothing in \"Help!\" to compare with that wild ballet of the Beatles racing across a playground in \"A Hard Day's Night\", nothing as wistful as the ramble of Ringo around London all alone&nbsp;...

Although Lester's depiction of Indian culture was largely negative and [[Brownface|stereotypical]], the film's focus on [[Kali]] and other Hindu themes anticipated the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]'s fascination with Indian philosophy and music.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Andrew Grant|year=2015|title=1965: The Most Revolutionary Year in Music|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-250-05962-8|page=164}}</ref> In his book ''1965: The Year Modern Britain Was Born'', cultural commentator Christopher Bray views ''Help!'' as \"one of the central surrealist texts\" of the 1960s, and the film that best captures the \"magical weirdness\" of London before the commercialisation that accompanied its international recognition as the world's \"[[Swinging London|Swinging City]]\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Christopher|last=Bray|title=1965: The Year Modern Britain Was Born|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XwyAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT195|year=2014|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=London|isbn=978-1-84983-387-5|pages=25, 257fn}}</ref>\n\nRonnie D. Lankford of [[AllMovie]] describes ''Help!'' as a \"forerunner to music videos\", adding: \"Lester seemed to find the right tone for ''Help!'', creating an enjoyable portrait of the Beatles and never allowing the film to take itself too seriously. His style would later be co-opted by [[Bob Rafelson]] for [[the Monkees]]' television series in the '60s and has continued to influence rock musicals like 1998's ''[[Spice World (film)|Spice World]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:22130~T1 |title=Help! |access-date=24 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426195934/http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg |archive-date=26 April 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>{{cfn|reason=When do the quotes end?

However, the sequence was left in the film novelisation.\n\n==Release history==\nLike ''A Hard Day's Night'', ''Help!'' was originally distributed theatrically by [[United Artists]] \u2013 the company handled distribution from 1965 to the end of 1980. In January 1981, rights to the film reverted from UA to producer Walter Shenson, and the film was withdrawn from circulation.\n\n''Help!'' was released several times in different video formats by [[MPI Media Group|MPI Home Video]] and [[The Criterion Collection]]. A version was released in February 1987 in VHS and Beta through MPI, along with a reissue of ''A Hard Day's Night'' the very same day, and was followed by a special-edition release on 31 October 1995. MPI also issued a CLV laserdisc in 1995 and two releases on DVD, the first as a single DVD release on 12 November 1997 and the second as part of ''The Beatles DVD Collector's Set'' on 8 August 2000.\n\nLaserDisc releases include a Criterion CAV laserdisc and a Voyager CLV laserdisc in 1987, each of which had three pressings. The first pressings had no [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] on the gatefold covers while the other two had the UPC either as a sticker or printed directly on the jacket.\n\nThe film's transfer on the CAV laserdiscs was done correctly so that no blending of frames occurs and thus movements are not blurry. The supplemental section, which, with few exceptions, has never been available on any other home video release, contains the following:\n* original theatrical trailer (which includes deleted scenes)\n* silent home film footage of the film set and of the world premiere\n* still photos, some of which are introduced by text describing the production history of the film\n* posters\n* sheet music\n* record jackets\n* radio ads (on audio during the silent footage)\n* an open interview, originally designed for disc jockeys. By reading prompts on the screen, one can pretend to talk to the Beatles.\n\nIn June 2007, a version of ''Help!'', sub-titled in Korean, became available on Amazon.com. However, by July 2007, all home video versions of the film were pulled from the market because of rights issues involving Apple Corps \u2013 now the full rights holders to the film. The rights issues were eventually resolved and Apple Corps/EMI/Capitol released a new double DVD version with a fully restored image and newly remixed in 2.0 stereo and [[5.1]] [[surround]] sound of the film. This came in standard 2xDVD packaging and 2xDVD deluxe edition box set on 30 October 2007 in the UK and 6 November 2007 in America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emigroup.com/Press/2007/press60.htm |title=Stop worrying&nbsp;...
