It was produced by [[Screen Gems]] and distributed by [[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group|Sony Pictures Releasing]]. The film stars [[Natasha Henstridge]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Jason Statham]], [[Pam Grier]], [[Clea DuVall]], and [[Joanna Cassidy]]. Set on a [[Colonization of Mars|colonized]] [[Mars]] in the 22nd century, the film follows a squad of police officers and a convicted criminal who fight against the residents of a mining colony who have been possessed by the ghosts of the planets original inhabitants.\n\nThe film received mostly negative reviews and was a box office bomb, earning $14&nbsp;million against a $28&nbsp;million production budget.<ref name=\"BOM\" /> The film would be John Carpenter's last feature until his return with ''[[The Ward (film)|The Ward]]'' in 2010.\n\nThe film has received a [[cult following]] since its release, with critics praising the action sequences, soundtrack and blending of genres.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://411mania.com/movies/gratuitous-b-movie-column-john-carpenters-ghosts-mars-awesome/|title=411MANIA|website=The Gratuitous B-Movie Column: Why John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars Is Awesome}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spectrumculture.com/2019/05/23/oeuvre-carpenter-ghosts-of-mars/|title=Oeuvre: Carpenter: Ghosts of Mars|date=May 24, 2019|website=Spectrum Culture}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jun/04/john-carpenter-ghosts-of-mars-not-bad-movie| title=Hear me out: why John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars isn't a bad movie| date=June 4, 2021| newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Given the film's debt to [[Western (genre)|Western]] cinema, particularly the works of Howard Hawks, it has been considered by a number of critics as an example of the [[Weird West]]ern subgenre.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in the second half of the 22nd century, Mars has been 84% terraformed, giving the planet an Earth-like atmosphere. Martian society has become matriarchal, centring on the city of Chryse, with smaller, far-reaching outposts connected by an expansive network of trains. In the wake of a series of mysterious 'incidents', Mars Police Force officer Lt. Melanie Ballard is called before a tribunal to give testimony following a disastrous mission to the remote mining outpost Shining Canyon to retrieve convicted felon James 'Desolation' Williams of which she is apparently the sole survivor.\n\nThrough a series of flashbacks, and flashbacks within flashbacks as new perspectives are incorporated into the narrative, Ballard recounts her mission to Shining Canyon. Accompanied by commanding officer Helena Braddock, cocky sergeant Jericho Butler and rookie officers Bashira Kincaid and Michael Descanso, Ballard arrives at Shining Canyon to find the town seemingly deserted. Investigating the town's jail, Braddock discovers a trio of individuals who appear to have sealed themselves into one of the cells; among them science officer Dr. Arlene Whitlock.\n\nBallard and Butler discover a number of disoriented miners and an escaped Desolation. The group are soon attacked by several of the miners, forcing Ballard and Desolation to band together and incapacitate them. Ballard is forced to shoot and kill one of them, causing their affliction to be passed on to one of the three survivors. Butler, venturing out to the edge of town in pursuit of one of the feral miners, discovers a row of severed heads mounted on spikes, including the head of Commander Braddock, and a large assembly in the canyon below committing horrific acts of self-mutilation and ritualistic execution.\n\nDesolation's associates soon arrive and force Ballard and Butler to release him. While they originally plan on leaving the officers and remaining miners to die, Ballard convinces them to work together to survive. Their initial effort to escape is halted when the army of feral miners converge on their position, killing, injuring and infecting several of their number. Confronted by Ballard, Whitlock eventually explains that she fled from her post after discovering an ancient underground vault created by an extinct Martian civilisation. When the door to the vault was opened, it released hostile spirits or \"ghosts\", which took possession of the workers, causing their violent behaviour. Killing a possessed human merely releases the Martian spirit to possess another host. Ballard surmises that these Martian spirits believe humans to be an invading race. Ballard is briefly possessed until Desolation feeds her a hallucinogenic drug, which forces the Martian spirit to leave her body.\n\nThe group are forced to flee as the possessed workers breach the jail, leaving only Ballard, Desolation, Butler, Kincaid and Whitlock left alive. While they are able to make it to the train, Ballard realises that they have a duty to exterminate the Martian threat and decide to return to Shining Canyon to overload the outpost's nuclear power plant, assuming that the ensuing atomic blast will vaporise the spirits. While they are able to initiate the meltdown, Whitlock is possessed, while Butler, Kincaid and the two train operators are killed. Boarding the train, the two watch as the army is engulfed in the explosion. Desolation tends to Ballard's wounds. Unwilling to face the authorities, he handcuffs Ballard to her cot and leaves. She moves to shoot him, but realizes her respect for him and lets him make his escape.\n\nResting after her tribunal, Ballard is woken by an alert that the city is under attack. Realizing their attempt to destroy the spirits failed, she readies herself to face the onslaught alone until she is greeted by Desolation, who hands her a weapon. The two agree to fight their way out of the city together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Natasha Henstridge]] as Lieutenant Melanie Ballard\n* [[Ice Cube]] as James \"Desolation\" Williams\n* [[Jason Statham]] as Sergeant Jericho Butler\n* [[Clea DuVall]] as Officer Bashira Kincaid\n* [[Pam Grier]] as Commander Helena Braddock\n* [[Joanna Cassidy]] as Dr. Arlene Whitlock\n* Richard Cetrone as Big Daddy Mars\n* Eileen Weisinger as Woman Warrior\n* [[Liam Waite]] as Officer Michael Descanso\n* [[Duane Davis]] as \"Uno\" Williams\n* Lobo Sebastian as \"Dos\"\n* [[Rodney A.

[[Courtney Love]] was originally cast, but she left the project after her boyfriend's ex-wife ran over her foot in her car while she was in training for the picture. Natasha Henstridge replaced her by the suggestion of her boyfriend [[Liam Waite]]. Jason Statham was originally going to play Desolation Williams, but he was replaced by Ice Cube because the producers needed some star power for the part, and Statham instead played the character of Jericho Butler.\n\nAlthough Mars has a day/night cycle almost identical in length to Earth's, most of the film is set at night. Mars is shown only once in the daytime, in a flashback when a scientist describes how she found and opened a tunnel, unleashing the alien spirits.\n\nFilming began on August 8, 2000, and ended on October 31, 2000. Production had to be shut down for a week when Henstridge fell ill due to extreme exhaustion, as she had just done two other films back-to-back before joining production at the last moment.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}\n\nMuch of the film was shot in a [[New Mexico]] [[gypsum]] mine.

Marc Savlov of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' gave the film one star out of five, saying \"Ghosts of Mars is a muddled, derivative, and embarrassing disaster straight on through.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/events/film/2001-08-24/141402/ |website=Austin Chronicle|title=Movie Review: John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars}}</ref> Bruce Fretts of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said about the film \"...it's distressingly amateurish and hackneyed to the point of absurdity,\" further adding \"it's dishearting to see the 'master of horror' bring himself to both write and direct a film with such a [[prepubescent]] understanding of horror\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/ew/article/review/movie/0,6115,172500~1~0~johncarpentersghostsof,00.html|title=Protected Blog \u203a Log in|website=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref> James Berardinelli gave the film 1.5 stars out of four.<ref>{{cite web  |url=http://www.reelviews.net/movies/g/ghosts_mars.html |title=Ghost of Mars |publisher=reelviews.net}}</ref> Rob Gonsalves of eFilmCritic.com suggested that the film was symbolic of \"Carpenter at rock bottom\".

I miss seeing campy action flicks like this at the [[drive-in]].\" [[David Stratton]] and [[Margaret Pomeranz]], film critics for ''[[The Movie Show]]'', both awarded the film three stars out of five. In his review, Stratton made the following observation \u2013 \"John Carpenter doesn't seem to have moved forward from the 70s and early 80s, when he made his best films. Though it's not terribly exciting, ''Ghosts Of Mars'' does have a marvelously skewed vision and can deliver genuine morbid laughs when it wants to.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/movies/review/sci-fi-fans-will-love-it|title=Sci-Fi fans will love it!|newspaper=SBS Movies|access-date=January 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIce Cube was very critical about the movie: \"I don't like that movie.

He claimed he was trying to make a mindless and silly, yet highly entertaining and thrilling, action flick where \"the universe allows its characters and plot points to be silly without becoming full-fledged comedies\", akin to 80s movies like ''[[Commando (1985 film)|Commando]]'', ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'', and ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]''. Looking back on the film and its criticism, he stated he was frustrated that most people thought the film was meant to be a serious horror movie, and feels that he should've made the film more openly comedic and \"in on the joke\", saying \"I have no power over what critics say, but when people complained about the movie being campy and not scary...the name of the movie is Ghosts Of Mars, I figured the campiness would be self-explanatory.\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened at No. 9 in the North American box office in its opening weekend (8/24-26) with $3,804,452,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2001&wknd=34&p=.htm|title=Weekend Box Office Results for August 24\u201326, 2001 \u2013 Box Office Mojo|website=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> grossed $8,709,640 in the North American domestic box office, and $5,301,192 internationally, totaling $14,010,832 worldwide.<ref name=\"BOM\" /> On a budget of $28&nbsp;million, ''Ghosts of Mars'' was a box office disappointment.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Ghosts of Mars\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[John Carpenter]]\n| cover      = \n| alt        =\n| released   = 2001\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     = Cherokee Studios, Hollywood\n| genre      = {{flatlist|\n* [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]]\n* [[film score]]\n}}\n| length     = 42:59\n| label      = [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]]\n| producer   = [[Bruce Robb]]\n| prev_title = [[Vampires (soundtrack)|Vampires]]\n| prev_year  = 1998\n| next_title = [[Assault on Precinct 13 (soundtrack)|Assault on Precinct 13]]\n| next_year  = 2003\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = Filmtracks\n| rev1Score = {{rating|1.0|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/ghosts_mars.html |title=Ghosts of Mars (John Carpenter) |publisher=Filmtracks |date=September 1, 2001|access-date=January 16, 2013}}</ref>\n| rev2 = SoundtrackNet\n| rev2Score = {{rating|2.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|author=Other reviews by Messrob Torikian |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/albums/database/?id=2877 |title=Ghosts Of Mars (2001) |publisher=Soundtrack |date=August 2, 2003|access-date=January 16, 2013}}</ref>\n| noprose = yes\n}}\n{{main|Ghosts of Mars (soundtrack)}}\nFor the film's soundtrack, John Carpenter recorded a number of synthesizer pieces and assembled an all-star cast of guitarists (including thrash metal band [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], virtuoso [[Steve Vai]], genre spanning [[Buckethead]], and former [[Guns N' Roses]]/current [[Nine Inch Nails]] guitarist [[Robin Finck]]) to record an energetic and technically proficient heavy metal score.
