Based on the 1984 novel of the [[Random Hearts (novel)|same name]] by [[Warren Adler]], the film is about a police officer and a [[Member of Congress|Congresswoman]] who discover that their spouses were having an affair prior to being killed in an air disaster.\n\n==Plot==\nSergeant William \"Dutch\" Van Den Broeck is a police sergeant in the Internal Affairs Division of the [[Washington, D.C.]] [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia|Metropolitan Police Department]], working on a case involving a crooked detective. He is married to a fashion editor. Kay Chandler is a Congresswoman running for re-election. She is married to a lawyer and has a teenage daughter.\n\nA Boeing 737-300 bound for [[Miami]] crashes, and everyone on board is killed. Dutch realizes that his wife was on the plane, but the airline has no record of her. He believes that she was registered under another name and was having an affair, and he finds out that she was sitting next to Kay's husband. Wanting to learn more about the affair, he meets with Kay. Concerned about the publicity, she is not willing to talk and tells him to leave her alone.\n\nDutch goes to Miami and visits the hotel that his wife was planning to go to. Kay, who has changed her mind, meets with him there. They talk more about the situation. After flying back home, they kiss in her car. Dutch goes to a campaign fundraiser for Kay and convinces her to not drop out of the race.\n\nDutch invites Kay to his cabin near [[Chesapeake Bay]]. She visits him, and they have sex. He still wants to know more about the affair and believes that their two spouses had an apartment together, but Kay tells him that they should forget about the past and move on with their lives.\n\nStressed, Dutch is suspended from his job after assaulting a suspect. He and Kay each find out about the apartment separately. When Dutch goes to visit the apartment, he finds Kay already there cleaning everything out. She leaves, and he chases her into the street, where he is shot by the suspect in his case. He lives, and the suspect is caught.\n\nWith rumors about their relationship growing, Kay publicly confirms that she and Dutch are friends. Dutch soon gets promoted to lieutenant, and Kay loses her bid for re-election. As she is leaving Washington, Dutch meets her at the airport. They are happy to see each other, and he asks if he can take her out on a date sometime.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as Sergeant William \"Dutch\" Van Den Broeck\n* [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] as Kay Chandler\n* [[Charles S.

In the 1980s, actor [[Dustin Hoffman]] met with the book's author with a view to making the film. Although Hoffman prompted [[CBS Theatrical Films]] to acquire the rights with a view to his starring in the film, he rejected several drafts of the script before leaving the project altogether.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50E11F93D5A0C708CDDA90994D1494D81&pagewanted=1|title=FILM; How My Novel Was Almost 'Developed' Into Oblivion|last=Adler|first=Warren|date=1999-10-03|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-09-09}}</ref> In the early 1990s, [[Kevin Costner]] was attached to star in the project, which was then to be directed by [[James L. Brooks]], though this, too, never came to pass. The crash of the Boeing 737 was inspired by the crash of [[Air Florida Flight 90]], a Boeing 737-200 that took off from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport with destination to Tampa Bay, Florida.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1993-08-27/entertainment/9308250565_1_hollywood-studios-warren-adler-roses|title='War Of The Roses' Author|access-date=2016-09-09}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n''Random Hearts'' was poorly received by critics. Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] retrospectively gives the film a rating of 15% based on reviews collected from 87 critics.

They exist in the same film, but they don't add up to the result of the film. Actually, the film has no result\u2014just an ending, leaving us with all of those fine pieces, still waiting to come together.
