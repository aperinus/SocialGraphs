It follows the plights of three different women and their experiences with [[abortion]]. Each of the three stories takes place in the same house, 22 years apart: 1952, 1974, and 1996. All three segments were co-written by [[Nancy Savoca]]. Savoca directed the first and second segment while [[Cher]] directed the third. The women's experiences in each vignette are designed to demonstrate the popular views of society on the issue in each of the given decades.\n\nDebuting at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], ''If These Walls Could Talk'' became a surprise success and was the highest-rated movie in HBO history.<ref>{{cite news|title= HBO's 'Walls' Tell Eye-Opening Stories\n| work= [[Santa Rosa Press Democrat]] | date=March 5, 2000|url= http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SA&p_theme=sa&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAFEBEAAA7AA203&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM}}</ref> It was nominated for four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], including for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie|Outstanding Television Movie]] and three [[Golden Globe Awards]], including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film|Best Miniseries or Television Film]].\n\n==Plot==\n\n===1952===\nThe 1952 segment deals with Claire Donnelly, a widowed nurse living in suburban [[Chicago]], who becomes pregnant by her brother-in-law and decides to undergo abortion in order not to hurt her late husband's family. However, abortion at the time is strictly illegal. Claire eventually finds another nurse who provides her the phone number of a woman who can find her someone to perform the abortion. The woman on the phone tells Claire that the only trustworthy care provider she knows is located in [[Puerto Rico]], and Claire cannot afford the travel costs\u2014with air fare and hotel costs, the total trip would cost about $1000 (about $10,800 in 2022). After a failed attempt to end her pregnancy with a [[knitting needle]], Claire contacts a man who comes to her home and performs a clandestine, hasty procedure on her while she lies atop her kitchen table. Claire finally manages to abort, but dies shortly afterwards due to massive blood loss.\n\n===1974===\nThe 1974 segment deals with Barbara Barrows, a struggling and aging mother with four children and a night-shift-working policeman husband, who discovers she is pregnant, despite having recently gone back to college. She considers abortion with the support of her teenage daughter, but ultimately chooses to keep the child.\n\n===1996===\nThe 1996 segment deals with Christine Cullen, a college student pregnant by a married professor, who decides on an abortion when he breaks up with her and only offers her money. After consulting with her roommate she makes an appointment with Dr. Beth Thompson. However, the abortion takes place during a violent protest and, during the actual abortion, an anti-abortion protester walks in and shoots Dr. Thompson immediately after she completes the procedure. Christine comforts Dr. Thompson as the doctor slowly bleeds out.\n\n==Cast==\n'''1952 segment'''\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Claire Donnelly\n* [[Shirley Knight]] as Mary Donnelly\n* [[Catherine Keener]] as Becky Donnelly\n* [[Jason London]] as Kevin Donnelly\n* [[CCH Pounder]] as Jenny Ford\n\n'''1974 segment'''\n* [[Hedy Burress]] as Linda Barrows\n* [[Sissy Spacek]] as Barbara Barrows\n* [[Joanna Gleason]] as Julia\n* [[Xander Berkeley]] as John Barrows\n* [[Janna Michaels]] as Sally Barrows\n* [[Ian Bohen]] as Scott Barrows\n* Zack Eginton as Ryan Barrows\n\n'''1996 segment'''\n* [[Anne Heche]] as Christine Cullen\n* [[Cher]] as Dr. Beth Thompson\n* [[Jada Pinkett Smith|Jada Pinkett]] as Patti\n* [[Eileen Brennan]] as Tessie\n* [[Lindsay Crouse]] as Frances White\n* [[Craig T.
