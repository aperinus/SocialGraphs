Under the leadership of President Coin and the advice of her trusted friends, Katniss reluctantly becomes the symbol of a mass rebellion against the Capitol and fights to save [[Peeta Mellark|Peeta]] and a nation moved by her courage. It is the sequel to ''[[The Hunger Games: Catching Fire]]'' and was followed by the concluding entry, ''[[The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 2]]''.\n\n''Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1'' was released on November 21, 2014 in the United States. Like its predecessors, the film was a commercial success grossing $55 million on its opening day, making it the largest opening day of 2014 and the sixth-largest in November. The film went to the No. 1 spot during its opening weekend with a $273.8 million worldwide gross, becoming the biggest opening of 2014 and marking ''The Hunger Games'' film series as the only franchise to have three films earn over $100 million in a weekend. The film earned over $755 million worldwide, making it the [[2014 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth highest-grossing film of 2014]] and the second-highest-grossing entry in ''The Hunger Games'' series.\n\n''Part 1'' received generally positive reviews from critics, who commended its acting, musical score and political subtext, but received criticism for its pacing and lack of action. The filmmaker's decision to split the novel into two separate adaptations was also criticized, with many feeling that the decision was unnecessary. It is the lowest-rated ''Hunger Games'' film of the franchise, according to review aggregators [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and [[Metacritic]]. The film had garnered a nomination for [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]] at the [[41st Saturn Awards]]. For her performance, Lawrence received a nomination for [[Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie|Best Actress in an Action Movie]] at the [[20th Critics' Choice Awards]] and a Saturn Award nomination. The song \"[[Yellow Flicker Beat]]\" also received a nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] at the [[72nd Golden Globe Awards]] and Critics' Choice Awards.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400-700 words. -->\n\nAfter being rescued from the destroyed arena in the 75th Hunger Games, tributes [[Katniss Everdeen]], [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Beetee|Beetee]], and [[Finnick Odair]] are taken to District 13, a below-ground district isolated from Panem that has been spearheading the rebellion. Katniss is reunited with [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Mrs. Everdeen|her mother]] and sister [[Primrose Everdeen|Prim]] and is introduced to [[List of The Hunger Games characters#President Coin|President Alma Coin]], the rebel leader. Katniss is told that her arrow destroying the forcefield led to riots in over half the districts, joining District 13 in the rebellion, which caused Snow to bomb District 12 in retaliation. Coin asks her to become the \"Mockingjay\"\u2014a symbol of the rebellion\u2014as part of a \"[[Winning hearts and minds|hearts and minds]]\" strategy. Katniss reluctantly agrees after seeing Peeta being manipulated on state television to quell the rebellion. She visits the ruins of District 12, her old house somehow untouched with white roses from President Snow inside.\n\nKatniss meets her film team and is given [[Effie Trinket]] as a stylist and close friend, [[Gale Hawthorne|Gale]], as a bodyguard. They go to District 8 where Katniss is filmed being saluted by dozens of wounded civilians at a hospital; Snow, seeing the footage, orders an airstrike at the hospital, killing everyone inside. The crew films Katniss and Gale shooting down two Capitol hovercraft and Katniss' rage-filled threat: \"If we burn, you burn with us.\" Afterwards, loggers in District 7 revolt, shouting the same phrase and killing Peacekeepers by detonating land mines.\n\nKatniss and her team travel to District 12. Katniss is filmed singing \"[[The Hanging Tree (The Hunger Games song)|The Hanging Tree]].\" Hundreds of protesters in District 5, singing the same anthem, launch a suicidal [[human wave attack]] against a [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dam]] that is the Capitol's primary source of electricity. The attack successfully implodes and breaches the dam, causing a blackout that forces the Capitol to revert to secondary generators. That night, Katniss watches Peeta being interviewed by [[Caesar Flickerman]], the Games' former presenter, when Coin and Beetee hijack the signal to air a clip of Katniss. After seeing it, Peeta suddenly shouts a warning that the Capitol is about to attack District 13. Coin orders a mass evacuation into deep, underground shelters, and the facility survives the attack. Upon emerging, Katniss discovers the area littered with white roses; she concludes that Snow orchestrated this to inform her that whenever she condemns the Capitol, they\u2019ll torture Peeta in retaliation.\n\nCoin dispatches an elite special-forces team to rescue Peeta and remaining victors [[Johanna Mason]], [[Enobaria]], and [[Annie Cresta]] from their prison. Beetee hijacks the Capitol's defense system with a \"[[propaganda|propo]]\" narrated by Finnick to convince more districts to side with the rebellion in which Finnick reveals that Snow would force \"desirable\" tributes (including Finnick himself) into prostitution with the threat of killing their families if they refused (which happened to Johanna) and that Snow only became the leader of Panem because he poisoned his opponents. When the propo proves not to be enough, Katniss communicates directly with Snow as a further distraction to buy enough time. Gale's team rescues the victors and escapes the Capitol easily, indicating the Capitol reduced its security on purpose. When Katniss greets Peeta, he unexpectedly attacks and strangles her into unconsciousness before being knocked out by Boggs.\n\nKatniss wakes up and is informed that Peeta has been \"hijacked\"\u2014brainwashed into trying to kill her, which explains why the Capitol allowed them to escape with him. Peeta is placed in [[solitary confinement]], while a serum is developed to reverse the hijacking effects.\n\nCoin announces that the rebels' next objective is the Capitol's principal military stronghold in District 2\u2014now the only district remaining loyal to the Capitol.\n\n==Cast==\n{{For|character descriptions from the novels|List of The Hunger Games characters}}\n{{See also|List of The Hunger Games cast members}}\n<!--- Cast per tombstone closing credits and order, which included 19 actors, with roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Katniss Everdeen]]\n* [[Josh Hutcherson]] as [[Peeta Mellark]]\n* [[Liam Hemsworth]] as [[Gale Hawthorne]]\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as [[Haymitch Abernathy]]\n* [[Elizabeth Banks]] as [[Effie Trinket]]\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#President Coin|President Alma Coin]]\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Plutarch Heavensbee|Plutarch Heavensbee]]\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Beetee|Beetee]]\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as [[Caesar Flickerman]]\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#President Snow|President Snow]]\n* [[Willow Shields]] as [[Primrose Everdeen]]\n* [[Sam Claflin]] as [[Finnick Odair]]\n* [[Jena Malone]] as [[Johanna Mason]]\n* [[Stef Dawson]] as [[Annie Cresta]]\n* [[Mahershala Ali]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Boggs|Boggs]]\n* [[Natalie Dormer]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Cressida|Cressida]]\n* [[Wes Chatham]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Castor|Castor]]\n* [[Elden Henson]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Pollux|Pollux]]\n* [[Patina Miller]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Commander Paylor|Commander Paylor]]\n* [[Evan Ross]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Messalla|Messalla]]\n* [[Robert Knepper]] as [[Antonius]]\n* [[Sarita Choudhury]] as Egeria\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\nOn July 10, 2012, [[Lionsgate]] announced that the third and final installment in the series, ''[[Mockingjay]]'', would be split into two parts.
