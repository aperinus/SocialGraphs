It was released in the US on April 4, 2014. ''On the Other Side of the Tracks'' is the story of two very different police officers who team up after a business mogul's wife is murdered. A sequel titled ''[[The Takedown (2022 film)|The Takedown]]'' was released on May 6, 2022 on [[Netflix]].\n\n== Plot ==\n\nWhen bad boy police officer Ousmane is involved in a car accident, he is mistaken for the assailant by his fellow police officers. The next day, the wife of a business mogul turns up nearby Ousmane's housing project. Ousmane draws connections between the two crimes and believes he is able to solve both crimes. In order to be heard by fellow police officers, Ousmane is forced to team up with visiting Parisian investigator Francois Monge, who has much more departmental clout. Despite coming from and working in very different neighborhoods, the pair find common ground through their policing style, including manhandling suspects and kicking butt.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Omar Sy]] as Ousmane Diakhit\u00e9\n*[[Laurent Lafitte]] as Fran\u00e7ois Monge\n*[[Sabrina Ouazani]] as Yasmine\n*[[Lionel Abelanski]] as Daniel Cardinet\n*Youssef Hajdi\tas Giovanni / Nabil\n*Maxime Motte\tas Van Gogh\n*L\u00e9o L\u00e9othier as G\u00e9rard\n*[[Andr\u00e9 Marcon]] as Chaligny\n*[[Zabou Breitman]] as Commissaire Morland\n*Patrick Bonnel as Balard\n*Roch Leibovici as Patrick\n*Rebecca Azan as Laurence\n*Tchewk Essafi as Samir (as Tchewik Essafi)\n*Patrick Kodjo Topou as Tyson\n*Samuel Goreini as Sam\n*[[Katia Tchenko]] as The keeper of the Aviary\n}}\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was released in the United States on April 4, 2014, opening on 50 screens.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{TCMDb title}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|on_the_other_side_of_the_tracks}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* {{mojo title|othersideofthetracks}}\n\n[[Category:2012 films]]\n[[Category:2010s French-language films]]\n[[Category:French comedy films]]\n[[Category:2012 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Ludovic Bource]]\n[[Category:2010s French films]]"}]}}}}
