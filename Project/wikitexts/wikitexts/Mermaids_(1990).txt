Based on [[Patty Dann]]'s 1986 [[Mermaids (novel)|novel of the same name]], and set in the early 1960s, its plot follows a [[neurosis|neurotic]] teenage girl who moves with her wayward mother and young sister to a small town in [[Massachusetts]].\n\nOriginally planned as the English-language debut of Swedish director [[Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m]], the film was ultimately directed by Benjamin after both Hallstr\u00f6m and [[Frank Oz]] abandoned the project. Filming of ''Mermaids'' took place in various locations in Massachusetts in the fall of 1989.\n\nReleased in December 1990, ''Mermaids'' was met with critical acclaim, particularly for the performance of Ryder, who received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award]] nomination and a [[National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actress|National Board of Review Award]]. Ricci also won a [[Young Artist Awards|Young Artist Award]] for her performance.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1963 [[Oklahoma]], Charlotte Flax is a [[neurosis|neurotic]] 15-year-old whose carefree single mother, Rachel, relocates Charlotte and her 9-year-old half-sister, Kate, each time she ends a relationship. Rachel's parenting approach - which more resembles friendship than mothering - troubles the anxiety-ridden Charlotte, who is embarrassed by her mother's flamboyant nature.\n\nAfter ending an affair with her married employer, Rachel and her daughters move to the small town of Eastport, [[Massachusetts]] where she also gets a job as a receptionist for a [[lawyer]]. Charlotte is ecstatic about their new home's location, as it borders a [[convent]], and she is obsessed with [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], to the annoyance of her [[irreligious]] [[Jews|Jewish]] mother.\n\nCharlotte soon becomes enamored with Joe Peretti, a 26-year-old caretaker of the convent and local school bus driver. Meanwhile, Rachel meets a local shoe store owner, Lou Landsky, and slowly begins a relationship with him. After the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] of [[John F. Kennedy]], Charlotte finds Joe ringing the convent bell and consoles him. However, as they begin to kiss, she feels filled with sin and flees. After the encounter, she begins [[fasting]] to purge her sinful thoughts, eventually passing out from hunger.\n\nUneducated about sex, Charlotte fears that God will punish her with pregnancy via [[immaculate conception]], and decides to steal her mother's car and run away. She drives all night before stopping at the home of a young family in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], claiming to have suffered car troubles.\n\nThe family invites her to have breakfast, but Lou arrives to retrieve Charlotte during the meal, having tracked her after reporting the car stolen. Rachel chastises Charlotte when she returns home, but Charlotte doesn't reveal why she ran away. The next day, Charlotte makes an appointment with a local obstetrician under the name [[Joan of Arc|Joan Arc]]. The doctor tells Charlotte it isn't possible for her to be pregnant as she is a virgin.\n\nAt a [[New Year's Eve]] costume party, Lou asks Rachel to marry and move in with him, but she declines, reminding him he is still legally married to his wife (who had left him). After the party, discovering her car refuses to start, Rachel is given a ride home by Joe. Upon arriving home, Rachel gives Joe a kiss, wishing him a happy New Year.\n\nCharlotte observes the kiss and storms outside, accusing her mother of trying to thwart her budding relationship and asking Joe why he would kiss Rachel before he drives off. On New Year's Day, with Rachel out for the day with Lou, Charlotte stays home with Kate and dresses up in her mom\u2019s clothes and makeup. She drinks some wine and offers some to Kate, who drinks a large amount without Charlotte knowing. Charlotte takes Kate to see the convent, and Charlotte\u2014not knowing Kate is drunk\u2014goes to check out the top of the bell tower by herself, leaving Kate behind to collect rocks near the river. Charlotte unexpectedly finds Joe in the tower, and they embrace and start to have sex. An unattended Kate falls in the river and nearly drowns, but the nuns from the convent save her.\n\nWhile Kate recovers, an infuriated Rachel gets into an argument with Charlotte about being irresponsible and threatens to again move them to another town. The argument ends after Rachel slaps Charlotte in the face, and they subsequently have a calm, heartfelt conversation. Discussing her father, Charlotte realizes he is never coming back. Rachel ultimately agrees to Charlotte's plea to stay in Eastport at least one more year.\n\nOver the following year, Rachel and Lou continue their relationship, while Joe relocates to [[California]] to open a [[plant nursery]]; he and Charlotte keep in contact via postcards. At school, she has gained a new reputation due to her sexual encounter with Joe, and replaces her Catholicism obsession with [[Greek mythology]]. Kate has recovered and has returned to competitive swimming, although the accident has left her hearing  [[Hearing loss|\"sounding fuzzy\"]] sometimes.\n\nThe film ends with Rachel, Charlotte, and Kate playfully dancing as they set the dinner table for a family meal, something they didn't used to do.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cher]] as Rachel Flax / Mrs. Flax\n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as Louis \"Lou\" Landsky\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as Charlotte Flax\n* [[Michael Schoeffling]] as Joseph \"Joe\" Peretti  \n* [[Christina Ricci]] as Kate Flax\n* [[Caroline McWilliams]] as Carrie\n* [[Jan Miner]] as Mother Superior\n* Betsy Townsend as Mary O'Brien\n* Richard McElvain as Mr. Crain\n* Paula Plum as Mrs. Crain\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nProducers initially engaged Swedish director [[Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m]] to direct ''Mermaids'' as his English-language feature debut, but he left the project to direct ''[[Once Around]]'' (1991).<ref name=afi/> They subsequently hired [[Frank Oz]] as a replacement, but he also abandoned the project after clashing with actresses Cher and Winona Ryder.<ref name=afi/><ref name=\"yglesias\">{{cite news |last=Yglesias |first=Linda |date=December 17, 1990 |title=Getting Along Swimmingly: For 'Mermaids,' Cher And Ryder Got To Be A Dynamic Duo |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1990-12-17-9004140390-story.html |url-status=dead |access-date=December 1, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181012155046/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1990-12-17-9004140390-story.html |archive-date=12 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite news |last=Hinson |first=Hal |date=December 14, 1990 |title=Mermaids |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/mermaidspg13hinson_a0a9c0.htm |access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref> Ultimately, they hired [[Richard Benjamin]] to direct the project.<ref name=afi/>\n\nProducer Patrick Palmer commented that both Hallstr\u00f6m and Oz had envisioned a darker tone for the film, and that at one point, Hallstr\u00f6m's version of the film included Charlotte committing [[suicide]].<ref name=afi/>\n\n===Casting===\n[[Emily Lloyd]] was originally cast in the role of Charlotte Flax.<ref name=\"afi\">{{cite web |title=Mermaids (1990) |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/58614 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513080937/https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/58614 |archive-date=May 13, 2018 |access-date=November 12, 2021 |work=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]] |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |location=Los Angeles, California}}</ref> She had begun shooting the film when [[Cher]] complained that Lloyd did not look enough like her to play her daughter.
