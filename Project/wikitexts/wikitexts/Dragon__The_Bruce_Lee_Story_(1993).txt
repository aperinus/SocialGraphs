The film stars [[Jason Scott Lee]], with a supporting cast including [[Lauren Holly]], [[Nancy Kwan]] and [[Robert Wagner]]. The film follows the life of actor and martial artist [[Bruce Lee]] (Jason) from his relocation to the United States from Hong Kong to his career as a martial arts teacher, and then as a television and film actor. It also focuses on the relationship between Bruce and his wife [[Linda Lee Cadwell]], and the racism to which Bruce was subjected.\n\nThe primary source of the screenplay is Cadwell's 1975 biography ''[[Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew]]''. Other sources include [[Robert Clouse]]'s book ''Bruce Lee: The Biography'' and research by Cohen, including interviews with Cadwell and Bruce's son, [[Brandon Lee]]. Rather than a traditional biographical film, Cohen decided to include elements of mysticism and to dramatise fight scenes to give it the same tone as the films in which Bruce starred. ''Dragon'' was filmed primarily in Hong Kong, Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\n''Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story'' received generally positive reviews, with critics typically finding it entertaining despite criticisms of its veneration of Bruce. Jason was widely praised for his performance. The film was a commercial success and its revenue exceeded box office averages for biographical films, which was attributed to its romantic themes and its appeal to people outside the traditional [[kung fu film]] audience. A video game adaptation [[Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story (video game)|of the same name]] was released the following year. ''Dragon'' is dedicated to Brandon, who died several weeks before its release.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn Hong Kong, Bruce Lee's father [[Lee Hoi-chuen]] awakens from a nightmare about a phantom, known as the Demon, haunting his young son. He subsequently enrolls him in [[Chinese martial arts]] training with instructor [[Ip Man|Yip Man]]. As a young adult, Bruce fights British<ref name=ch4/><ref name=chase/> sailors who are harassing a young Chinese woman, resulting in him having to leave Hong Kong. His father insists he go to the US.\n\nIn the US, Bruce works as a dishwasher at a Chinese restaurant until he gets in a brawl with four of the cooks. The restaurant owner Gussie Yang fires him but also lends him money and encourages him to go to college. While studying philosophy in college, Bruce begins to teach martial arts classes, where he meets [[Linda Lee Cadwell|Linda]], a white American. Bruce marries Linda in defiance of her racist mother, Vivian. Linda suggests Bruce establish a martial arts school, but his Chinese peers demand he train only Chinese people. When Bruce refuses, they challenge him to settle the matter in combat. Bruce defeats a challenger named Johnny Sun in a secret, no-holds-barred match but Johnny attacks Bruce after he has admitted defeat, and Bruce sustains a debilitating back injury. While Bruce is temporarily paralyzed, Linda helps him write the martial arts book ''[[Tao of Jeet Kune Do]]''. Linda gives birth to their first child, [[Brandon Lee|Brandon]], and the couple reconcile with her mother.\n\nSome months later, during a martial arts tournament run by [[Ed Parker]], Johnny challenges Bruce to a rematch. Bruce not only defeats but humiliates Johnny, earning the respect of the audience. Bruce is unaware that Johnny becomes crippled from his injuries in the fight. After the match, Bill Krieger, who later becomes Bruce's manager, offers him the role of [[Kato (The Green Hornet)|Kato]] in the television series ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]''. Bruce and Krieger also create the idea for the television series ''[[Kung Fu (1972 TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', agreeing that Bruce will feature in the lead role. At a cast party, Linda says she is pregnant with their second child, [[Shannon Lee|Shannon]]. Shortly afterwards, the cancellation of ''The Green Hornet'' is announced. ''Kung Fu'' later makes it to television but much to Bruce's frustration, it stars the white actor [[David Carradine]]. Bruce believes Krieger has betrayed him.\n\nBruce returns to Hong Kong for his father's funeral. Philip Tan, a Hong Kong film producer, hires Bruce to star in the film ''[[The Big Boss]]''. During the filming of the final scene, Johnny's brother Luke attacks Bruce in revenge for Johnny's humiliating defeat and subsequent disability; Bruce wins the fight. ''The Big Boss'' is a success and Bruce makes several more films, working as an actor, director, writer and editor. This causes a rift between Bruce and Linda, as Linda wishes to return to the US. Krieger offers Bruce a chance to work on a big-budget Hollywood film, to which Bruce agrees, partly because of Linda's wish to return home.\n\nOn the 32nd day of filming ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', during the \"room of mirrors\" sequence, Bruce has a terrifying vision of the Demon that has haunted his and his father's dreams. This time, after being beaten and then shown his own grave, Bruce sees his son urging Bruce to save him. The Demon pursues Brandon, spurring Bruce to fight back, save Brandon and break the Demon's neck with a pair of Nunchaku. Bruce later films another scene from ''Enter the Dragon'', the film that would make him an international star. In a voice-over, Linda tells the audience Bruce fell into a mysterious coma and died shortly before the film's release, and says while many people want to talk about how he died, she prefers to remember how he lived.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Jason Scott Lee.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jason Scott Lee]] (no relation), pictured in 2003, starred as Bruce.|alt=Jason Scott Lee]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jason Scott Lee]] as [[Bruce Lee]]\n* [[Lauren Holly]] as [[Linda Lee Cadwell|Linda Lee]]\n* [[Robert Wagner]] as Bill Krieger\n* [[Michael Learned]] as Vivian Emery\n* [[Nancy Kwan]] as Gussie Yang\n* [[Lim Kay Tong|Lim Kay-tong]] as Philip Tan\n* [[Ric Young]] as [[Lee Hoi-chuen|Bruce's father]]\n* [[Wang Luoyong|Luoyong Wang]] as [[Ip Man|Yip Man]]\n* Sterling Macer as Jerome Sprout\n* [[Sven-Ole Thorsen]] as the Demon\n* John Cheung as Johnny Sun\n* Ong Soo Han as Luke Sun\n* [[Eric Bruskotter]] as Joe Henderson\n* [[Van Williams]] as ''The Green Hornet'' director\n* [[Shannon Lee]] as Party Singer\n* [[Rob Cohen]] as ''Enter the Dragon'' director\n}}\n<!--Please don't wikilink characters to the people they were based on.-->\n<!--Please don't change the way people were credited in the film, such as 'Enter the Dragon director'.

Y. Yunioshi]]. Morris describes the scene as didactic, as it allows Linda, who was originally enjoying the film, to understand and share Bruce's revulsion of racist stereotypes. Noting the film's portrayal of Bruce's life as a \"battle against Western prejudice\", Morris concludes ''Dragon'' is \"one of the more powerful treatments of institutionalized racism in a film industry that US cinema possesses\".<ref>{{cite book |author=Meaghan Morris |author-link=Meaghan Morris |year=2007 | editor-last1=Wilson |editor-first1=Roy |editor-last2=Connery |editor-first2=Christopher Leigh|title=The Worlding Project: Doing Cultural Studies in the Era of Globalization |chapter=Learning from Bruce Lee: Pedagogy and Political Correctness in Martial Arts Cinema |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p5muzG8-MJAC&pg=PA46 |publisher=[[North Atlantic Books]] |pages=49\u201357 |isbn=978-1556436802}}</ref>\n\nWriting in the ''[[Asian Journal of Communication]]'' in 2013, academic Zheng Zhu listed ''Dragon'' alongside ''[[Kiss of the Dragon]]'' (2001) and ''[[The Tuxedo]]'' (2002) as films that broke from the Western tradition of portraying Asian men as asexual, stating that while they are often featured as heroes in martial arts films, they are rarely portrayed as romantic or loving. Noting the films each show an Asian martial artist with a white female partner, Zhu states they reverse the conventional portrayal of a \"dominant white knight and a submissive Oriental lady\". However, he makes critiques of the portrayal of these relationships. For example, each film shows \"white women play[ing] the most important role\" in helping Chinese men accomplish success, as evidenced by Linda's support for Bruce while he recovers from his back injury. Asian men, Zhu argues, are portrayed as incapable of achieving success in Western society unless they are supported by white femininity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zhu |first1=Zheng |date=2013 |title=Romancing 'kung fu master' \u2013 from 'yellow peril' to 'yellow prowess' |journal=[[Asian Journal of Communication]] |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=403\u2013419|doi=10.1080/01292986.2012.756044 |s2cid=144868286 }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\n\nA major source for the film's screenplay, which was written by director Rob Cohen in cooperation with Edward Khmara and John Raffo, was Linda Lee Cadwell's biography ''[[Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew]]''.<ref name=higgins/> Other sources included [[Robert Clouse]]'s book ''Bruce Lee: The Biography'', and original research by Khmara and Cohen.<ref name=chase/><ref name=ch2>{{harvnb|Cohen|1993|loc=Chapter 2}}</ref> Cadwell provided resources for the film's production.

He decided to avoid making a standard biographical film and instead incorporate \"mystical and legendary aspects\" to dramatise Bruce's life,<ref name=ch2/> telling his story \"as if it were, in fact, a Bruce Lee movie\".<ref name=ch4/> Cohen learnt that for the first two years of Bruce's life, his parents had dressed and passed him off as a girl to protect him from a superstitious Chinese belief that demons target first-born sons. Influenced by this tale, Cohen decided to show Bruce being pursued by a supernatural demon, seeing it as a metaphor for an inner demon that may have motivated and influenced Bruce. When Cohen first met Cadwell after giving her the screenplay, she asked how Cohen had learnt about Bruce's demon. Cohen said he had dramatised the plot element after studying his life; Cadwell said Bruce told her he felt as though a demon was trying to drag him away when he collapsed 10 weeks before his death.<ref name=ch2/> Cohen spent hours talking to both Cadwell and Brandon in preparation for the film.<ref name=bernard/>\n\n\n===Casting===\n\n{{quote box|width=20%|quote=\"[Brandon Lee] said I wouldn't survive in this part if I treated his father like a god.

The opening scene was filmed at an 18th-century temple in Hong Kong, which Cohen found while scouting locations.

Cohen wanted to film in Seattle but found little cooperation from local authorities and was denied permission to film at the [[University of Washington]], which Bruce had attended.
