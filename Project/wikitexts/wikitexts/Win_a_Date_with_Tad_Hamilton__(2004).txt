The film follows a small-town girl (Bosworth) who wins a contest for a date with a male celebrity (Duhamel) and a [[love triangle]] forms between the girl, the star and the girl's best friend (Grace).\n\nThe character's name of Tad Hamilton has been seen as a cross between the names of screen idols [[Tab Hunter]] and [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.dvdfuture.com/review.php?id=572 dvdfuture.com :: Review - Win A Date With Tad Hamilton<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ent/movies/reviews/2366620.html Win a Date With Tad Hamilton | Chron.com - Houston Chronicle<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.beansouptimes.com/MOVIE_Tad_Hamilton.htm Movie Tad Hamilton<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405045618/http://www.beansouptimes.com/MOVIE_Tad_Hamilton.htm |date=April 5, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics and earned $17.1 million in the United States and $4.2 million overseas for a worldwide total of $21.3 million, making it a [[Box office bomb|commercial failure]] against a $22 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nA soldier and nurse emerge from two 1940s-style cars in the middle of the night. As the nurse runs up to the soldier, the camera switches, revealing that this is a film scene.\n\nRosalee, Cathy, and Pete, [[Piggly Wiggly]] store workers in [[Fraziers Bottom, West Virginia]] are watching the filming, and as the nurse asks for forgiveness and the soldier agrees, the women in the audience are moved to tears as Pete is clearly unimpressed.\n\nAs the ladies wonder what the film's star Tad Hamilton is doing at that moment, Tad is described by his agent as \"drinking, driving, smoking, leering, and groping all at the same time.\"\n\nThe agent tells Tad that his hedonism is damaging his reputation and career opportunities. To improve his image and convince a film director to cast him, his agents establish a competition to win a date with Tad, with proceeds benefiting the charity [[Save the Children]]. Rosalee finds an online advertisement for the competition.\n\nWith the help of the Piggly Wiggly customers and a reluctant Pete, Cathy and Rosalee raise the $100 entrance fee as Pete tells his superior that he will leave for college in Richmond after he talks \"with someone about going to Richmond with me.\"\n\nA news crew arrives outside Rosalee's home because she has won the date with Tad. A despondent Pete accompanies her to the airport. Awed by Los Angeles, Rosalee becomes tongue-tied in Tad's presence. The date does not go well; Rosalee vomits in the limousine, and when Tad mentions his love of animals, which Pete had warned was a signal of sexual intentions, her suspicions are raised. After seeing Tad's house, Rosalee requests to return to the hotel and soon returns home, leaving Tad thoughtful.\n\nPete is about to tell Rosalee about moving to Richmond when she is surprised by Tad's sudden arrival. Although she is still cynical, when he admits to not having \"his priorities straight,\" she is convinced of his good intentions.\n\nOn a phone call with his agent, Tad insists that he wants to turn over a new leaf, and won't return to Los Angeles for a while. When he gathers Rosalee for a date, he leaves a positive impression on Rosalee's father, who had studied hard for the encounter. Pete tries to stop their date by reporting them for illegally parking. He tries to convince Rosalee that Tad is using her. Despite all of Pete's efforts, Rosalee and Tad grow close over the next few days.\n\nIn a bar, Pete corners Tad in the men's room. After conceding that Rosalee is in love with Tad, Pete tells him that she is more than a \"wholesome small town girl\" but a wonderful person with \"the kind of beauty a guy only sees once.\" He explains her six smiles that reveal her emotions.\n\nPete makes Tad swear not to break Rosalee's heart. When Rosalee is in Tad's hotel room, his agents appear and inform him that the director has cast him in the film. Tad is overjoyed and convinces Rosalee to accompany him to Los Angeles by employing Pete's \"six smiles\" speech.\n\nAfter a rousing speech about great love by Angelica, a barmaid with a crush on him, Pete rushes to Rosalee's, confessing his love. She is confused and resolves to still travel to California with Tad. On the plane, Tad fails to identify one of Rosalee's smiles and then confesses his lie, prompting her to return home.\n\nRosalee runs to Piggly Wiggly and to Pete's, where Angelica tells her how Pete feels and that he is going to Richmond to escape his heartbreak. Rosalee then drives furiously toward Richmond to find Pete. In a manner similar to that of the opening scene, Rosalee and Pete exit their cars and Pete asks her to dance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=40em}}\n* [[Kate Bosworth]] as Rosalee Futch<ref name=BBC>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008m3hc/credits|title=Credits|publisher=BBC|access-date=May 17, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Topher Grace]] as Pete Monash<ref name=BBC/>\n* [[Josh Duhamel]] as Tad Hamilton<ref name=BBC/>\n* [[Gary Cole]] as Henry Futch<ref name=BBC/>\n* [[Ginnifer Goodwin]] as Cathy Feely<ref name=BBC/>\n* [[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]] as Richard Levy the Shameless<ref name=BBC/>\n* [[Nathan Lane]] as Richard Levy the Driven<ref name=BBC/>\n* [[Kathryn Hahn]] as Angelica<ref name=BBC/>\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Janine<ref name=BBC/>\n* [[Amy Smart]] (cameo) as Nurse Betty<ref name=BBC/>\n* Ren Torstle as Porsche Woman<ref name=BBC/>\n* Wendy Worthington as Customer<ref name=BBC/>\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as George Ruddy<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/r626k/win-a-date-with-tad-hamilton|title=Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!|work=Radio Times|access-date=May 17, 2017|last=Aldridge|first=Dave}}</ref>\n* [[Moon Bloodgood]] as Gorgeous Woman<ref name=TVGuide>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/win-a-date-with-tad-hamilton/cast/137228/|title=Win a Date With Tad Hamilton!|access-date=May 17, 2017|publisher=TV Guide}}</ref>\n*  Mary Jo Smith as Sonja<ref name=TVGuide/>\n*  Joseph Convery as Mickey (Tad's driver)<ref name=TVGuide/>\n* [[Deena Dill]] as Reporter<ref name=TVGuide/>\n* [[Bob Glouberman]] as Rosalee's limo driver<ref name=TVGuide/>\n* [[Jay Underwood]] as Policeman Tom<ref name=TVGuide/>\n* [[Sam Pancake]] as Hotel Clerk<ref name=TVGuide/>\n* [[Patrick Thomas O'Brien|Patrick O'Brien]] as Father Newell<ref name=TVGuide/>\n* Larry Agney as 90 Year Old Man<ref name=TVGuide/>\n* [[Willow Bay]] as Herself<ref name=TVGuide/>\n*  Todd Eckert as Maitre D'<ref name=TVGuide/>\n*  David Wolrod as Roger Bodger<ref name=TVGuide/>\n*  [[Jessy Moss]] as Herself<ref name=TVGuide/>\n*  [[Marshall Goodman]] as Himself<ref name=TVGuide/>\n*  Danny Weissfeld as Himself<ref name=TVGuide/>\n* Caleb Speir as Himself<ref name=TVGuide/>\n* Peter Iovino as Paparazzi<ref name=TVGuide/>\n* Alex Kvassay as Pilot<ref name=TVGuide/>\n* [[Jordana Brewster]] (''uncredited'') as Actress (deleted scene)\n* [[Paris Hilton]] (''uncredited'') as Heather (deleted scene)<ref name=BBCDVD>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2004/08/12/win_a_date_with_tad_hamilton_2004_dvd_review.shtml|title=Win A Date With Tad Hamilton DVD|publisher=BBC|last=Papamichael|first=Stella|access-date=May 17, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Bonnie McKee]] (''uncredited'') as herself\n{{colend}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened in 2,711 venues on January 23, 2004 and earned $7,320,066 in its opening weekend, ranking third in the North American box office and second among the week's new releases.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2004&wknd=04&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for January 23-25, 2004 | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | date=January 26, 2004 | access-date=December 4, 2016}}</ref> The film ultimately grossed $17,071,962 in North America and $4,206,494 internationally for a worldwide total of $21,278,456.
