The group includes Chris, a meek office worker and Eagle Scout; Phil, a manipulative bully who steals his ideas; Lisa, an HR manager and Chris' love interest; and Jared, a sarcastic slacker.  However, when the pilot is found dead and Storm, their ex-marine guide, is mauled by a tiger, the office workers must fend for themselves.\n\nPhil tries to assume leadership, but the group votes for Chris. Phil immediately wants to sacrifice Javier so they can eat him. He finds some coffee and adds a hallucinogenic herb that induces an orgy among some of the coworkers. They split into two teams. Chris\u2019 team consists of Lisa, Jared, and Brenda. Phil feeds his team more psychedelic herbs and sets himself up as God. Chris` team finds an abandoned building with supplies. Storm is revealed to be alive and not a marine. Chris' team is captured by Phil's group, and Chris beats Phil by pretending to be a better God. A ship rescues the workers, except Phil who is left behind. Storm is arrested for impersonating a marine. Chris gets Phil's job, but quits, taking Lisa with him. It is also revealed Jared is now dating Brenda.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Jean-Claude van Damme]] as Storm Rothschild\n* [[Adam Brody]] as Chris\n* [[Megan Boone]] as Lisa\n* [[Rob Huebel]] as Phil\n* [[Kristen Schaal]] as Brenda\n* [[Eric Edelstein]] as Jared\n* [[Dennis Haysbert]] as Mr. Crawford \n* Bianca Bree as Ashley\n* Kristopher van Varenberg as Brett\n* [[Robert Peters (actor)|Robert Peters]] as Dale\n* Aaron Takahashi as Troy\n* Brian Tester as Senior Naval Officer\n* Stephanie L\u00f3pez as Stephanie\n* Mark Sherman as Sailor Bob\n* Michael J.
