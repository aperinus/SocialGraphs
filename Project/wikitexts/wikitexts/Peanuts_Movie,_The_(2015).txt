Schulz]]'s [[comic strip]] ''[[Peanuts]]'', produced by [[Blue Sky Studios]] and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. It is the fifth full-length ''Peanuts'' film, and the first in 35 years.<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> The film is directed by [[Steve Martino]] from a screenplay by Craig and Bryan Schulz (Schulz's son and grandson, respectively), and Cornelius Uliano, and stars the voices of [[Noah Schnapp]] as [[Charlie Brown]] and, via archival recordings, [[Bill Melendez]] as [[Snoopy]] and [[Woodstock (Peanuts)|Woodstock]]. The film sees Charlie Brown trying to improve his odds with the [[Little Red-Haired Girl]], while Snoopy writes a book where he is a [[World War I]] [[Flying Ace]] trying to save his fellow pilot and love interest [[Snoopy#Fifi|Fifi]] from the [[Red Baron]] and [[Jagdstaffel 11|his flying circus]].\n\nDevelopment of the film began in 2006, six years after the death of Charles Schulz and the final release of the last ''Peanuts'' comic strip. Craig Schulz, the son of Charles, pitched a film idea to his son, Bryan Schulz. Twentieth Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios announced development of a computer-animated film in October 2012, with Steve Martino directing, due to his faithfulness to the style of [[Dr. Seuss]] in the film, ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' (2008), also produced by Blue Sky.<ref name=\"TWPGoodPlan\" /><ref name=\"Charles-Peanuts\" /> Numerous elements from the comic strip were featured in the film, such as Charlie Brown's skating pond, his house, \"the wall\" and Lucy's psychiatrist booth, as well as the Snoopy and Woodstock voice tracks from [[Bill Melendez]].<ref name=\"USATodayRedFifi\" /> The soundtrack was composed by [[Christophe Beck]], with contributions by [[Meghan Trainor]] and [[David Benoit (musician)|David Benoit]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"MIPMarkets\" />\n\n''The Peanuts Movie'' premiered in [[New York City]] on November 1, 2015,<ref name=\":1\" /> and was released in the United States five days later. It grossed $246 million worldwide against a $99 million budget to become the [[List of animated feature films of 2015#Highest-grossing animated films of 2015|7th highest-grossing animated film of 2015]]. The film was met with generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the animation, voice acting, and faithfulness to the source material. It received nominations for the [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]], the [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature]], and was the first Blue Sky Studios film to be nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film]], but lost to ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen the [[Little Red-Haired Girl]] moves into the neighborhood, [[Charlie Brown]] becomes infatuated with her, though worries his long-running streak of failures will prevent her from noticing him. After [[Lucy van Pelt|Lucy]] tells him he should try being more confident, Charlie Brown decides to embark upon a series of new activities in hope of finding one that will get the Little Red-Haired Girl to notice him. \n\nHelped by [[Snoopy]] and [[Woodstock (Peanuts)|Woodstock]], he performs a magic show act in the school's [[talent show]]; however, he is forced to drop his act in order to help his sister [[Sally Brown|Sally]] with hers. Charlie Brown then signs up for the [[School Dance|school dance]] and gets Snoopy to teach him. At the dance, Charlie Brown attracts praise for his skills, but he slips during his performance. This sets one of his shoes to hit the sprinkler, causing the dance to be cut short and the students to look down upon him once more.\n\nCharlie Brown is partnered with the Little Red-Haired Girl to write a book report. When she is called away for a week to deal with a family illness, Charlie Brown decides to write the report alone, on the collegiate-level novel ''[[War and Peace]]'', to which he writes a comprehensive report. At the same time, Charlie Brown finds he is the only student to get a perfect score on a standardized test taken earlier that school year. His friends and the other students congratulate him, and his popularity begins to climb. \n\nHowever, when he goes to accept a medal at a [[school assembly]], he learns the test papers were accidentally mixed up, and that [[Peppermint Patty]] was actually the one who got the perfect score. Saddened that his sudden popularity was all for nothing, Charlie Brown reveals the mistake and declines the medal, thus becoming unpopular again. To make matters worse, his book report is accidentally shredded by [[Linus van Pelt|Linus]]' model tri-plane, causing him to admit to the Little Red-Haired Girl that he has caused them both to fail the assignment.\n\nMeanwhile, Snoopy writes a novel about his [[World War I]] [[Flying Ace]] persona trying to save [[Snoopy#Fifi|Fifi]] from the Red Baron with help from Woodstock and his friends, using the key events and situations surrounding Charlie Brown as inspiration to develop his story. He acts out his adventure physically and coming across Charlie Brown and the gang several times along the way. Snoopy, in the end, manages to defeat the Red Baron by [[kamikaze]] and save Fifi.\n\nBefore leaving school for summer, Charlie Brown is surprised when the Little Red-Haired Girl chooses him for a [[pen pal]]. Linus convinces Charlie Brown he needs to tell the Little Red-Haired Girl how he feels about her before she leaves for the summer. Racing to her house, he discovers she is about to leave on a bus for [[summer camp]]. He tries to chase the bus but is prevented from reaching it. Just as he is about to give up, Charlie Brown sees a kite fall from the [[Kite-Eating Tree]]. The string becomes entangled around his waist and sails away with him. Amazed to see Charlie Brown flying a kite, his friends follow. Upon reaching the bus, Charlie Brown finally asks the Little Red-Haired Girl why she has chosen him in spite of his failures. The Little Red-Haired Girl explains she admires his selflessness and determination, calling him an honest, caring, and compassionate person. As a result, everyone congratulates Charlie Brown for his efforts, hard work, and for being a true friend.\n\nIn the first [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Lucy tries to convince Charlie Brown to kick the football once more. Charlie Brown is apprehensive, but Lucy tells him that she now understands that he is kind, compassionate, brave, and funny and that no one would pull a football away from someone with all of those qualities. Charlie Brown, convinced, agrees once more, only for Lucy to pull the football away and adds smugly that she forgot to say that he is gullible, causing Charlie Brown to smile. In the second mid-credits scene, Snoopy, Fifi, Woodstock, the Beagle Scouts, and [[Snoopy's siblings]] celebrate Snoopy's victory over the Red Baron with root beer, that is until the Red Baron shows up again and knocks Snoopy into the root beer causing him to shout \"Curse you, Red Baron!\" (via thought bubble). In the post-credits scene, Linus' model tri-plane finally sputters to a stop over the pond and falls straight in.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Peanuts Gang 2015.png|thumb|The main Peanuts characters as seen in the closing shot of the film (which later turns into a comic strip frame as Schulz signs his signature on the bottom) (L to R): Franklin, Marcie, Peppermint Patty, Linus, Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy, Woodstock, Sally, Schroeder, and Pig-Pen.]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Noah Schnapp]] as [[Charlie Brown]]<ref name=BWCast>{{cite press release|author1=Twentieth Century Fox|title=THE PEANUTS MOVIE Cast Announced|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20141127005023/en/PEANUTS-MOVIE-Cast-Announced|publisher=Business Wire|access-date=November 27, 2014|date=November 27, 2014|archive-date=November 29, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129185302/http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20141127005023/en/PEANUTS-MOVIE-Cast-Announced|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* Hadley Belle Miller as [[Lucy van Pelt|Lucy]]<ref name=BWCast />\n* Mariel Sheets as [[Sally Brown|Sally]]<ref name=BWCast />\n* Alex Garfin as [[Linus van Pelt|Linus]]<ref name=BWCast />\n* [[Francesca Angelucci Capaldi]] as the [[Little Red-Haired Girl]] and [[Frieda (Peanuts)|Frieda]].<ref name=BWCast /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2015/11/05/making-the-peanuts-movie/#wkC.ZfQ5ikq3|title=From paper to pixels \u2013 The incredible, true tale of 'The Peanuts Movie'|publisher=Mashable.com|first=Lance|last=Ulanoff|access-date=November 5, 2015|archive-date=March 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074616/http://mashable.com/2015/11/05/making-the-peanuts-movie/#wkC.ZfQ5ikq3|url-status=live}}</ref> Describing the Little Red-Haired Girl, Capaldi says: \"She's very nice and kind and has a great heart.
