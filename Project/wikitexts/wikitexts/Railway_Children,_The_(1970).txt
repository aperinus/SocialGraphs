Nesbit]]. The film was directed by [[Lionel Jeffries]] and stars [[Dinah Sheridan]], [[Jenny Agutter]] (who had earlier featured in the [[BBC]]'s 1968 dramatisation of the novel), [[Sally Thomsett]] and [[Bernard Cribbins]] in leading roles. The film was released to cinemas in the [[United Kingdom]] on 21 December 1970.\n\nThe film rights were bought by Jeffries. It was his directorial debut and he wrote the screenplay. ''The Railway Children'' was a critical success, both at time of release and in later years.\n\n==Plot==\nThe storyline is [[episodic storytelling|episodic]], reflecting the original serialisation of the novel. In 1905, the Waterburys are an affluent family who live in a luxurious villa in the suburbs of London. Charles Waterbury, the father, works at the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]]. The day after Christmas, he is arrested on suspicion of being a spy. This is hidden from the rest of the family by his wife. The family become impoverished and are forced to move to a house called Three Chimneys in [[Yorkshire]], which is near [[Oakworth railway station]]. When they arrive, they find the house in a mess and rat-infested. The three children, Roberta (known by her nickname Bobbie), Phyllis and Peter, find amusement in watching the trains on the nearby railway line and waving to the passengers. They become friends with Albert Perks, the station porter, and with an elderly gentleman who regularly takes the 9:15 train. To make ends meet, their mother works as a writer and also home schools the children.\n\nMrs Waterbury falls ill with flu. Bobbie writes to the gentleman, who delivers food and medicine to the house to help their mother get better. They are admonished by their mother for telling others of their plight and asking for assistance. The following day, a man is found at the railway station. He speaks a language they cannot understand. The children figure out he can speak French, in which their mother is fluent. Mrs Waterbury discovers the man is an exiled Russian writer who has arrived in England to find his family who had fled there. He stays at their house. Bobbie writes another letter to the gentleman, asking him to help in finding the exile's family, who are soon found.\n\nOne day, while watching the railway tracks, they notice there has been a landslide which has partially obstructed the tracks. The children fashion the girls' red petticoats into flags to warn the driver of the impending danger. The train stops due to their warning. The railway company and villagers hold a party for the children and thank them for their actions. The children are given personalised engraved watches and are dubbed \"The Railway Children\".\n\nThe children find out that Mr Perks, the station porter, doesn't celebrate his birthday. They secretly ask for gifts from the villagers that he has helped in the past and deliver the gifts to his house. Mr Perks initially refuses the gifts as he doesn't accept charity. However, after the children explain that the gifts are from people that he has helped over the years, he thanks them for their kindness. In return the following day, he delivers old newspapers and magazines for them to read. Bobbie reads one of the newspapers and notices a story about their father being imprisoned. She discusses this with her mother who finally discloses that their father is in prison after having been falsely convicted of being a spy and selling state secrets. She speculates that a jealous colleague of his may be behind it. Bobbie again contacts the gentleman and asks him to help her father; he informs her that since meeting the children and reading about their father's case, he has been working to prove his innocence.\n\nA group of youths are playing a game of [[Paper Chase (game)|paper chase]] which the children observe. One of the boys injures his leg in a railway tunnel and is helped by the children. He is taken to their house where he recuperates from his injuries. The gentleman visits their house and reveals that the boy is his grandson, Jim, and thanks the family for looking after him. Jim and Bobbie grow close during his recuperation and promise to write to each other when he departs to his home.\n\nAfter Jim's departure, the children remark on their long hiatus from waving at the train passengers, and resolve to go to the railway the following morning. When they do so, all the passengers wave at them, and the gentleman gestures to a newspaper. Later, with a strange prescience, Bobbie excuses herself from her lessons and walks down to the station, where Perks hints that something special has happened. Confused, Bobbie stands on the station platform, where in the silent lingering smoke she sees her father, who has just alighted onto the platform after being exonerated and released from prison. She runs to greet him shouting \"daddy; my daddy!\". They return to 'Three Chimneys' and the family are reunited.\n\n===End credits===\nThe entire cast break the [[fourth wall]] and perform a curtain call as the credits roll. The camera moves slowly along a railway track towards a train which is decked in flags, in front of which all of the cast are assembled, waving and cheering to the camera. At the start of the credit sequence, a voice can be heard shouting \"Thank you, Mr Forbes\" to acknowledge producer [[Bryan Forbes]]. At the end, Bobbie Waterbury ([[Jenny Agutter]]) holds up a small slate on which \"The End\" is written in chalk.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col | colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jenny Agutter]] as Roberta 'Bobbie' Waterbury\n* [[Sally Thomsett]] as Phyllis Waterbury\n* [[Gary Warren (actor)|Gary Warren]] as Peter Waterbury \n* [[Dinah Sheridan]] as Mother, Mrs. Waterbury \n* [[Bernard Cribbins]] as Albert Perks\n* [[William Mervyn]] as the Old Gentleman\n* [[Iain Cuthbertson]] as Father, Charles Waterbury\n* [[Peter Bromilow]] as Doctor Forrest \n* [[Ann Lancaster]] as Ruth \n* Gordon Whiting as Russian\n* Beatrix Mackey as Aunt Emma \n* [[Deddie Davies]] as Mrs. Nell Perks \n* [[David Lodge (actor)|David Lodge]] as Band Leader\n* Christopher Witty as Jim\n* [[Brenda Cowling]] as Mrs. Hilda Viney \n* Paddy Ward as Cart Man \n* [[Erik Chitty]] as Photographer \n* [[Sally James (presenter)|Sally James]] as Maid \n* Dominic Allan as CID Man  \n* Andy Wainwright as Desk Sergeant \n* [[Lionel Jeffries]] as Malcolm (Voice)\n* [[Richard Leech]] as Doctor (Voice)\n* [[Amelia Bayntun]] as Cook (uncredited)\n* [[Bob Cryer]] (Chairman of the K&WVR) as the guard of the train carrying Mr. Waterbury (uncredited)\n* [[Paul Luty]] as Malcolm (uncredited)\n* Graham Mitchell (K&WVR Guard) as Train Guard (uncredited)\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Earlier adaptations===\nThe novel was adapted for radio in 1943.<ref>Radio\nHarrisson, Tom.

He had lost his own books and borrowed ''The Railway Children'' from his 13-year-old daughter Martha (he had two other children). He loved it, although he admitted \"my personality is so different from the quiet romance of the story.\"<ref name=\"guard\"/>\n\nHowever, he said \"I found the climate of the... story just right for me, a way in which to start entertaining people and help not destroy our industry. There are hardly any films being made for children and for middle aged and older age groups. I thought this could be one.\"<ref name=\"guard\"/>\n\nHe bought a six-month option on the film rights for \u00a3300 and wrote a screenplay. \"I've kept to the story,\" said Jeffries. \"It would be an imposition not to \u2013 after all, E.

The tunnel is a lot shorter in reality than it appears in the film, for which a temporary extension to the tunnel was made using canvas covers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Keighley and Worth Valley Railway|url=http://www.haworth-village.org.uk/steam-trains/kwvr/kwvr-overview.asp|publisher=Haworth Village|access-date=2013-06-02}}</ref>\n\nFour of the already-preserved [[locomotives]] based on the Worth Valley Railway were chosen for use in the film's production in relation to role; [[Hudswell Clarke|MSC67]] as the local train engine, newly-arrived [[GWR 5700 Class|5775 (L89)]] as the Old Gentleman's engine, [[L&YR Class 25|52044]] (preserved as L&Y 957) as 'The Green Dragon' express and [[GNR Class N2|4744 (69523/1744)]] as the 'Scotch Flyer'. They were painted in period-inspired liveries for the filming: 5775 in brown, reminiscent of the [[William Stroudley|Stroudley]] livery of the [[London Brighton and South Coast Railway]]; 957 in apple green, similar to liveries used by the [[North Eastern Railway (United Kingdom)|North Eastern Railway]]; [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]]; and [[London and North Eastern Railway]], and 4744 and MSC67 in plain black, as used by most railway companies in Britain at one time or another. 67 is now at the [[Middleton Railway]] in Leeds and 4744 is now with the [[North Norfolk Railway]] at [[Sheringham]]. 5775 and 957 are still on the Worth Valley Railway. As of 2021, 957 has returned to service after overhaul in its film guise, and 5775 is on static display at the Oxenhope Exhibition Shed having been repainted into its GN&SR livery. 4744 is undergoing a ten-yearly overhaul in Norfolk and 67 remains at Middleton but on display, having last operated in 2012.\n\nA wide variety of vintage rolling stock was used in the film, including examples from the [[Metropolitan Railway|Metropolitan]] and London and North Eastern railways. Although different carriages appeared in different liveries, the dominant one is white and maroon, which is reminiscent of the livery of the [[Caledonian Railway]]. The most important carriage in the film, the Old Gentleman's Saloon, was a North Eastern Railway Director's Saloon; it has also been used for the more recent stage production adaptation of the book. It and all the other carriages seen in the film are still at the KWVR, but tend to be used at special events only due to their age.\n\nA number of different locations were employed for various scenes. The house called \"Three Chimneys\" is in [[Oxenhope]], just north of the [[Oxenhope railway station]].<ref name=\"Locations\" /> The [[Bronte Parsonage]] in [[Haworth]] was used as the location for Doctor Forrest's surgery.<ref name=\"Locations\" /> The scenes of the children sitting on a bridge were filmed at [[Wycoller]], near [[Colne]]. Mytholmes Tunnel, near Haworth, and the railway line running through it, were used extensively in the film, including being the location for the [[Paper Chase (game)|paper chase]] scene, as well as the famous landslide scene, in which the children wave the girls' [[petticoats]] in the air to warn the train about said blockage. The landslide sequence itself was filmed in a cutting on the Oakworth side of Mytholmes Tunnel and the fields of long grass, where the children waved to the trains, are situated on the Haworth side of the tunnel. A leaflet, \"The Railway Children Walks\", is available from KWVR railway stations or the Haworth Tourist Information Centre.<ref>{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.kwvr.co.uk/products/299-the-railway-children-walks.html\n  |title=The Railway Children Walks\n  |publisher=[[Keighley and Worth Valley Railway]]\n  |access-date=2013-06-02\n}}</ref>\n\nThe scenes in the Waterburys' London house, before their move to Yorkshire, were filmed at [[Gainsborough Gardens|4 Gainsborough Gardens]] in Hampstead, north-west London.<ref name='Movie'>{{cite web|title=The Railway Children (1970)|url=https://www.movie-locations.com/movies/r/Railway-Children.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003144948/https://www.movie-locations.com/movies/r/Railway-Children.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 October 2019|work=Movie Locations|access-date=3 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\nThe film was the ninth most popular film at the British box office in 1971<ref>Peter Waymark. \"Richard Burton top draw in British cinemas.\" Times [London, England] 30 December 1971: 2.

It includes new interviews with [[Sally Thomsett]], [[Jenny Agutter]] and [[Bernard Cribbins]]. The planned commentary by director [[Lionel Jeffries]] was not completed due to his death in February 2010.\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n''The Railway Children'' received three nominations for awards at the [[24th British Academy Film Awards]] ceremony. Bernard Cribbins was nominated in the category of [[BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. However, in a category also featuring  [[John Mills]], [[Colin Welland]] and [[Gig Young]], the award went to Welland for his role in the film ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]''. Sally Thomsett received a nomination for [[BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer|Best Newcomer in a Leading Role]] but again lost out to an actor from ''Kes'', in this case [[David (Dai) Bradley|David Bradley]]. [[Johnny Douglas (conductor)|Johnny Douglas]] was also nominated for the [[Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music]] but the award was won by American [[Burt Bacharach]] for his film score for ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/BAFTA_Awards/1971 |title=IMDb: BAFTA Awards: 1971 |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |access-date=27 November 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Merchandise===\n[[Hornby Railways]] produced a 00 gauge train set of the train from the film.

It detailed events that took place during filming and interviews from local people associated with it. In November 2012, a second updated version was printed with added information, in particular about Gary Warren, who disappeared in the mid-1970s after retiring from acting. He had been tracked down by a member of the official ''[[Catweazle]]'' fanclub and the author had permission to write a more updated version of what had happened to him.\n\n===BBFC complaint===\nIn 2013, the [[British Board of Film Classification]] released a statement saying that they had received and evaluated a complaint about the film in that it encouraged children to trespass on the railway tracks. The BBFC noted that the children did trespass on the line, but only to warn an approaching train of the danger of a landslide on the track ahead. They had, however, in an earlier scene walked along the track simply to get to the station. The BBFC also pointed out that the film was set in [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] times when access to railway lines was not under the same restrictions as modern times.<ref>{{cite news|title=Railway Children Prompts Complaint|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/10543484.Railway_Children_prompts_complaint/|access-date=4 February 2016|work=Telegraph and Argus|date=11 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe film has left a lasting impression on the British film industry and audiences. In 1999, the [[British Film Institute]] (BFI) put ''The Railway Children'' in 66th place in its list of the [[BFI Top 100 British films|Top 100 British films]] of all time. Five years later, the film magazine ''[[Total Film]]'' named it the 46th greatest British film of the 20th century. In 2005, the British Film Institute included it in their list of 'The 50 films you should see by the age of 14'. In 2008, the film made it onto [[Channel 4]]'s list of the 100 Greatest Family Films at number 30, just ahead of ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' and just behind ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'' and ''[[Ghostbusters]]''.\n\nOn 28 March 2010, the Bradford International Film Festival concluded with a new restoration of ''The Railway Children'' film with the 40th anniversary digital premiere.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkshiredailyphoto.com/2010/03/railway-children-bradford-international.html |title=The Railway Children \u2013 Bradford International Film Festival 2010|publisher=[Yorkshire Daily Photo]|access-date=30 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Jenny Agutter]] also starred in a new TV adaptation of [[The Railway Children (2000 film)|''The Railway Children'' in 2000]] in the role of Mother.  Much of the publicity for the 2000 film focused on Agutter's involvement in both films which were made a generation apart.\n\nIn 2021 [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast ''The Saving of Albert Perks'', a monologue by Bernard Cribbins in which the now adult Roberta returns to Oakworth with two Jewish refugee children who have escaped [[Nazi Germany]] on the [[Kindertransport]].<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC Radio 4 - 80 Not Out, The Saving of Albert Perks |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000qwsg |website=BBC |access-date=8 November 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Sequel==\nIn May 2021, a sequel titled ''[[The Railway Children Return]]'' starring Jenny Agutter, started filming in and around Oakworth.
