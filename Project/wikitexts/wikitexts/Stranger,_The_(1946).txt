It is the first Hollywood film to present documentary footage of the [[Holocaust]].\n\nThe film was nominated for the [[Golden Lion]] (then-called the \u2018Grand International Prize\u2019) at the [[8th Venice International Film Festival]]. Screenwriter [[Victor Trivas]] received an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Story|Best Story]]. The [[List of films in the public domain in the United States|film entered the public domain]] when its [[copyright]] was not renewed.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:The stranger (1946).webm|thumb|left|thumbtime=25|upright=1|[[:File:The stranger (1946).webm|''The Stranger'']]]]\nMr. Wilson is an agent of the [[United Nations War Crimes Commission]] who is hunting for [[Nazism|Nazi]] fugitive Franz Kindler, a [[German war crimes|war criminal]] who has erased all evidence which might identify him. He has left no clue to his identity except \"a hobby that almost amounts to a mania\u2014clocks.\"\n\nWilson releases Kindler's former associate Meinike, hoping the man will lead him to Kindler. Wilson follows Meinike to a small town in [[Connecticut]], but loses him before he meets with Kindler. Kindler has assumed a new identity as \"Charles Rankin\", and has become a teacher at a local [[University-preparatory school#United States and Canada|prep school]]. He is about to marry Mary Longstreet, daughter of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice Adam Longstreet, and is involved in repairing the town's 400-year-old [[Habrecht]]-style [[Automaton clock|clock mechanism]] with religious automata that crowns the [[Belfry (architecture)|belfry]] of a church in the town square.\n\nMeinike attacks Wilson, leaving him for dead, and meets Kindler. Meinike is repentant and has become a Christian, and begs Kindler to confess his own crimes. Instead, Kindler strangles Meinike, who might expose him.\n\nWilson begins investigating newcomers to the small town. Due to Rankin and Mary's marriage, he does not suspect Rankin\u2014until Rankin says conversationally that since [[Karl Marx]] was a Jew, [[Nazi racial theories#Jews|he was not a German]]. Even so, not having witnessed the meeting with Meinike, he still has no proof. Only Mary knows that Meinike came to meet her husband. To get her to admit this, Wilson must convince her that her husband is a criminal\u2014before Kindler decides to eliminate the threat to him by killing her. Kindler's facade begins to unravel when Red, the family dog, discovers Meinike's body. To further protect his secret, Kindler poisons Red.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary begins to suspect her husband is not being honest with her. He admits to killing Meinike and Red, but claims Meinike was in town to blackmail her and her father. Mary still loves him and wants to protect him in any way she can; she helps by lying about Meinike. Then Wilson shows her graphic footage of [[Nazi concentration camps]] and explains how Kindler developed the idea of [[genocide]]. She is torn between her love and her desire to learn the truth. Meanwhile, Kindler tries to arrange a fatal \"accident\" for Mary, but she discovers the plot. Finally accepting the truth, she dares her husband to kill her face to face. Kindler tries, but is prevented by the arrival of Wilson and Mary's brother, and escapes from the house.\n\nKindler flees into the church belfry, followed by Mary and then Wilson. Meanwhile most of the town, hearing the repaired clock bell, has arrived outside the building. At the top of the tower, Kindler pulls a gun and a struggle ensues. Mary ends up with the gun and fires. The clock is damaged and begins running away; Kindler is shot. He staggers outside to the belfry's clock face, and is impaled by the sword of one of the moving clock figures. Weakened by his injuries, he falls to his death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Orson Welles]] as Franz Kindler/Professor Charles Rankin \n* [[Edward G.

Director Orson Welles gives the production a fast, suspenseful development, drawing every advantage from the hard-hitting script from the Victor Trivas story. \u2026 A uniformly excellent cast gives reality to events that transpire. The three stars, Robinson, Young and Welles, turn in some of their best work, the actress being particularly effective as the misled bride.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=December 31, 1945 |title=The Stranger  |url=https://variety.com/1945/film/reviews/the-stranger-1200414650/ |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=2015-03-17}}</ref>\n\n''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine featured ''The Stranger'' as Movie of the Week in its issue dated June 3, 1946.<ref>{{cite journal |date=June 3, 1946 |title=Movie of the Week: The Stranger  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I0oEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA75|journal=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |volume=20 |issue=22 |pages=75\u201378 |access-date=2015-03-17}}</ref> The film was screened in competition at the [[8th Venice International Film Festival|1947 Venice Film Festival]].\n\nOn its release, ''The Stranger'' was unfavorably compared to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943). \"One reason for the similarities is the recutting, supervised by Ernest Nims,\" wrote film historian Bret Wood. \"By removing the Latin American sequence and many of the political elements (such as the clock/fascist analogy),''The Stranger'' is transformed from a socially relevant drama to a small town murder story, with the villain more a psychopath than a political fugitive. Nims cut the film to play like a conventional thriller with little regard to Welles's subtextual purposes.\"<ref name=\"Bret Wood\"/>{{Rp|19}}\n\nIn his audio commentary for the 2013 Blu-ray release of ''The Stranger'', Wood calls it \"an undervalued film\" due to the absence of the \"stylistic swagger\" of ''Citizen Kane'' and ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]''. He regards Welles's third completed film as \"deceptive and much more complex stylistically and thematically\" than has so far been appreciated.<ref name=\"Bret Wood Commentary\"/>{{Rp|1:00}}\n\n==Adaptations==\n[[File:Movie-Mystery-Magazine-July-1946.jpg|thumb|The premiere issue of ''Movie Mystery Magazine'' (July\u2013August 1946) featured a novelization of ''The Stranger'']]\nThe debut issue (July\u2013August 1946) of the short-lived [[Pulp magazine|pulp digest]] ''Movie Mystery Magazine'' presented a [[Novelization|novelized condensation]] of the screenplay for ''The Stranger''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philsp.com/homeville/cfi/t552.htm |editor-last=Stephensen-Payne |editor-first=Phil |title=Movie Mystery Magazine  |publisher=Crime, Mystery & Gangster Fiction Magazine Index|access-date=2016-10-18}}</ref>\n\nA half-hour adaptation of ''The Stranger'' aired on CBS Radio's ''This Is Hollywood'' on December 7, 1946.
