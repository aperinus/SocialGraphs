It stars [[Al Pacino]], [[Catherine Keener]], [[Evan Rachel Wood]], [[Rachel Roberts (model)|Rachel Roberts]], [[Jay Mohr]], and [[Winona Ryder]]. The story follows a fading director creating a virtual actress to star in his films and the attempts he makes to keep her non-presence a secret as she becomes more famous. ''Simone'' garnered mixed reviews from critics but was a minor box-office hit, grossing $19.6 million worldwide against its $10 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen Nicola Anders ([[Winona Ryder]]), the star of the new film by out-of-favor director Viktor Taransky ([[Al Pacino]]), refuses to finish it, Taransky is forced to find a replacement. Contractual requirements totally prevent using her image in the film, so he must re-shoot. Instead, Taransky experiments with a new computer program he inherits from late acquaintance Hank Aleno ([[Elias Koteas]]) which allows the creation of a computer-generated woman which he can easily animate to play the film's central character. Taransky names his [[virtual actor]] \"Simone,\" a name derived from the computer program's title, '''''Sim'''ulation '''One'''''. Seamlessly incorporated into the film, Simone ([[Rachel Roberts (model)|Rachel Roberts]]) gives a fantastic performance, exactly controlled by Taransky. The film is immediately a huge success. The studio, and soon the world, ask \"who is Simone?\"\n\nTaransky initially claims that Simone is a recluse and requests her privacy be respected, but that only [[Streisand effect|intensifies media demands]] for her to appear. Taransky intends to reveal the secret of her non-existence after the second picture. To satisfy demand, he executes a number of progressively ambitious stunts relying on misdirection and cinematic special effects technology. Eventually, it escalates to simulated remote location video live interviews.\n\nIn one instance, two determined tabloid reporters discover Taransky used out-of-date stock photography as a background during an interview instead of being on that site as claimed, and they blackmail him into getting Simone to make a live appearance. He arranges her to perform a song at a stadium event appearing in a cloud of smoke and then using flawless holographic technology. The perception of being in person is reinforced with real-time visualization on the stadium's monitors. Simone becomes even more famous, simultaneously becoming a double winner for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], tying with herself in the process.\n\nOnce Taransky grows tired of Simone constantly overshadowing him in the press, he decides to ruin her career. Simone's next film, ''I Am Pig'', is her \"directorial debut\" and a tasteless treatment about [[zoophilia]] intended to disgust audiences. Not only does it fail to achieve the desired effect of audience alienation, but it also serves to foster her credibility as a risk-taking, fearless and avant-garde artist. Taransky's subsequent attempts to discredit Simone\u2014by having her drink, smoke, and curse at public appearances and use politically incorrect statements\u2014similarly backfire when the press instead begins to see her as refreshingly honest. As a last resort, Taransky decides to dispose of Simone completely by using a [[computer virus]] to erase her, dumping the hard drive and floppy disks into a steamer trunk, burying the trunk at sea, and then announcing to the press that she has died of a rare virus contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the Third World. During the funeral, the police interrupt, open the coffin and find only a cardboard cutout of Simone. He is arrested and shown a security camera video where he loads a large trunk onto his yacht.\n\nAfter being charged with her murder, he admits that Simone is not a person, but a computer program. The chest containing the computer data is brought up empty. Taransky's daughter Lainey and ex-wife Elaine enter his studio to try to help. They find Taransky's forgotten virus source disk (''Plague'') and apply an anti-virus program to eradicate the computer virus. They restore Simone and have her appear on national television laughing while holding up a newspaper headline with her obituary. They pick up a confused Taransky, with whom Elaine asks to get back together. In the end, Simone and Taransky are remotely interviewed at home about their new (virtual) baby, used as a [[Cover-up|cover story]] for her absence. Simone is concerned about her child's future and decides to enter politics.\n\nA post-credits scene reveals Viktor creating footage of Simone buying a calorie-laden meat pie TV dinner at a supermarket, while tabloid investigator character Max Sayer, who has an obsessive crush on Simone throughout the film, is thrilled to discover that she appears to love meat pies as much as he does.\n\n==Production==\nLike Andrew Niccol's predecessor ''[[Gattaca]]'', ''Simone'' deals with themes of the problematic aspects of technological advances being used to attempt to attain perfection. Unlike the former, however, ''Simone'' was Niccol's first attempt at a comedic satire with lighter moments and over-the-top drama. Niccol's first attempt at non-satire had been the earlier and more successful ''[[The Truman Show]]''.<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite news|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/simone-2002|title=Simone|last=Ebert|first=Roger|author-link=Roger Ebert|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]|date=August 23, 2002|access-date=July 17, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200719055444/https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/simone-2002|archive-date=July 19, 2020|url-status=live|via=[[RogerEbert.com]]}} {{Rating|2|4}}</ref> [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] and [[Jason Schwartzman]] were cast as obese tabloid investigator Max Sayer and his shady-looking but peculiarly childlike assistant, Milton, respectively. [[Rebecca Romijn]] was cast later in the role of Faith, Viktor's secretary who is so obsessed with Simone that she begins dressing like Simone, dying her hair like Simone and even trying to have sex with Viktor just so that she can hear him call her \"Simone\". These side-actors built up much of the side comedy surrounding the bizarre cultural phenomenon surrounding Simone. Footage of character [[Audrey Hepburn|Holly Golightly]] from ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast At Tiffany's]]'' was obtained from [[Paramount Studios]] to be used in the film for part of the basis of the Simone character, while scenic footage used for Simone's \"remote interview\" backgrounds was obtained from [[Getty Images]].<ref>{{citation|last1=Niccol |first1=Andrew |title=S1M0NE (movie) |date=2002 |publisher=New Line Cinemas}}</ref> Stylized elements present throughout the film and its post-credits included the use of #1 in place of any letter 'I', and a #0 in place of any letter 'O', which occurs for the entire duration of the credits, including for all cast and crew names featured.
