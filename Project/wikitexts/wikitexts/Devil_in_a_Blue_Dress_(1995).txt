The film is based on [[Walter Mosley]]'s 1990 [[Devil in a Blue Dress|novel of the same name]] and features [[Denzel Washington]], [[Tom Sizemore]], [[Jennifer Beals]], and [[Don Cheadle]].<ref>{{AFI film|id=59874|title=Devil in a Blue Dress}}.</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1948, World War II veteran [[Ezekiel \"Easy\" Rawlins]] is in need of a job, and becomes drawn into the search for a mysterious woman. The film received positive reviews, with many praising Cheadle's scene-stealing performance.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1948 [[Los Angeles]], Easy Rawlins is laid off from his job at Champion Aircraft and needs money to pay his mortgage. Easy's friend Joppy introduces him to DeWitt Albright, a white man looking for a missing white woman, Daphne Monet. Explaining that Monet's disappearance led her wealthy fianc\u00e9, Todd Carter, to drop out of the [[Mayor of Los Angeles|Los Angeles mayoral race]], Albright pays Easy to find Daphne, who is known to frequent the [[juke joint]]s along [[Central Avenue (Los Angeles)|Central Avenue]].\n\nEasy begins his search at an illegal club where he sees the bouncer, Junior Fornay, eject a white man. Learning that his friend Dupree Brouchard's girlfriend, Coretta James, is a confidant of Daphne, Easy spends the night with Coretta and discovers Daphne is involved with gangster Frank Green. Albright arranges a meeting at the Malibu pier, where Easy is accosted by racist white youths before Albright viciously humiliates one of the boys at gunpoint. Easy tells him about Green, and is given another payment to continue his search.\n\nReturning home, Easy is arrested by [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] homicide detectives, who reveal that Coretta has been murdered. Interrogated and beaten before being released, he is approached by Matthew Terell, the remaining mayoral candidate. Terell is with a young boy, supposedly his adopted son, and inquires about Daphne, but Easy divulges nothing. After a nightmare about Coretta, he receives a call from Daphne herself. They meet at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]], and she asks him to drive her to meet Richard McGee, a White man from the club. They arrive to find McGee dead, with his house ransacked. Easy notices a pack of Mexican cigarettes, the same brand smoked by Junior. Traumatized after witnessing the grisly scene, Daphne panics and flees, driving off and stranding Easy.\n\nEasy makes it home, but is threatened again by Albright and his partners, who demand that he track Daphne down a second time or face murder charges. Easy sends for his friend, Raymond 'Mouse' Alexander, and confronts Joppy for leading Daphne to him. He meets with Todd Carter, realizing that Albright actually works for Terell, and secures another payment to locate Daphne. Returning home, he is ambushed by Frank Green but rescued by Mouse. Frank escapes after the trigger-happy Mouse shoots him in the shoulder, and Easy misses a call from Daphne. Questioned again by the detectives, Easy is given until the following morning to clear his name.\n\nEasy and Mouse confront Junior \u2013 the owner of the cigarettes \u2013 who admits to driving McGee home and being given a letter for Coretta to deliver to Daphne. They visit Dupree where, inside Coretta's Bible, Easy finds the contents of a letter and incriminating photographs of Terell [[pedophilia|with naked children]]. At home, Easy finds Daphne waiting, and she reveals that Frank is her half-brother: their mother was [[Creole people|Creole]], and Daphne's father was white while Frank's was Black. Terell learned of Daphne's heritage, and the potential scandal forced Carter to abandon his campaign, but Daphne bought the pictures from McGee to blackmail Terell into silence. Hunting for Daphne and the pictures, Albright murdered McGee. When Coretta threatened to sell the pictures to Terell, Daphne sent Joppy to intimidate her, but did not expect him to kill Coretta.\n\nAlbright and his men arrive, subduing Easy and kidnapping Daphne. Joined by Mouse, Easy abducts Joppy at gunpoint, forcing him to take them to Albright's cabin in the [[Hollywood Hills]]. Easy and Mouse kill Albright and his men and rescue Daphne; returning to the car, Easy learns Mouse killed Joppy. Daphne pays Easy and Mouse $7,000 for the pictures, and Mouse returns home to [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] with his share. Daphne reveals that Carter's family paid her $30,000 to leave town, but she believes that the pictures will ensure Carter's victory and their marriage. Driving Daphne to meet Carter, who rejects her, Easy receives the rest of his payment in exchange for the pictures. Daphne and her brother leave town, while Carter's election is assured. No longer in trouble with the police, Easy considers starting his own business as a [[private investigator]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as [[Ezekiel \"Easy\" Rawlins|Easy Rawlins]]\n* [[Tom Sizemore]] as DeWitt Albright\n* [[Jennifer Beals]] as Daphne Monet\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as Mouse\n* [[Maury Chaykin]] as Matthew Terell\n* Joseph Latimore as Frank Green\n* [[Terry Kinney]] as Todd Carter\n* [[Mel Winkler]] as Joppy\n* [[Albert Hall (actor)|Albert Hall]] as Odell\n* [[Lisa Nicole Carson]] as Coretta James\n* Jernard Burks as Dupree Brouchard\n* David Wolos-Fonteno as Junior Fornay\n* [[Beau Starr]] as Miller, LAPD\n* John Roselius as Mason, LAPD\n* Nicky Corell as Shariff\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{Anchor|Production}}\n\n===Development===\n[[Carl Franklin]] wrote and directed the neo-noir because he liked the novel by Walter Mosley, who in turn served as an associate producer on the film. Franklin thought the work was more than a [[detective story]]; he said that Mosley was able to transform an everyday guy into a detective. In the editing process, Franklin had to cut a steamy love scene between Beals and Washington because he believed the scene was not needed to convey the story.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Movies/9509/devil_blue_dress/index.html Tornquist, Cynthia].

He concludes, \"The most interesting element of ''Devil in a Blue Dress'' is not the whodunit, but the 'whydunit.' Finding the guilty parties isn't as involving as learning their motivation, which is buried in society's perception of racial interaction. By uncovering the truth behind this mystery, Franklin illustrates that some attitudes have indeed changed for the better over the last forty years.\"<ref>[http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/d/devil_blue.html Berardinelli, James]. ''Reel Views'', 1995.</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]], writing for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', did not like the story much but enjoyed the look and tone of the film: \"I liked the movie without quite being caught up in it: I liked the period, tone and look more than the story, which I never really cared much about. The explanation, when it comes, tidies all the loose ends, but you're aware it's arbitrary \u2013 an elegant solution to a chess problem, rather than a necessary outcome of guilt and passion.\"<ref>[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/devil-in-a-blue-dress-1995 Ebert, Roger].

Rather it's the film's glowing visual qualities, a striking performance by Denzel Washington and the elegant control Carl Franklin has over it all that create the most exotic crime entertainment of the season.\"<ref>[http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie960406-103,0,7981406.story Turan, Kenneth] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929135727/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie960406-103,0,7981406.story |date=2007-09-29 }}.
