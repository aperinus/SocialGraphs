It is the third installment in the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'' franchise]]. Set directly after the events of ''[[Friday the 13th Part 2]]'', the plot follows a teenage girl (Kimmell) and her friends who go on a trip at a house near Crystal Lake where a wounded [[Jason Voorhees]] (Brooker) has taken refuge until reemerging for another killing spree. The film marks the first appearance of Jason's signature [[goaltender mask|hockey mask]], which has since become a trademark of both the character and the franchise, as well as an icon in [[Cinema of the United States|American cinema]] and the [[Horror film|horror genre]] in general.\n\nThe original storyline was supposed to focus on a [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic]] [[Ginny (Friday the 13th)|Ginny Field]] who began learning self defense and returned to college after surviving her ordeal in the previous film. After finding Paul's corpse inside her dormitory, she prepares to track down Voorhees and face him in a final confrontation. However, this concept was abandoned when [[Amy Steel]] declined to reprise her role.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Erickson |first1=Steve |title=Crypticon 2018 St Joseph MO Adrienne King Amy Steel panel Friday the 13th 1 & 2 sole survivors |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frVkMZGQETU  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/frVkMZGQETU |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|website=YouTube |access-date=27 February 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-line-up.com/friday-the-13th-part-2-amy-steel-interview/|title=The Girl That Got Away from Jason: An Interview with Amy Steel from Friday the 13th Part 2|work=The Lineup|author=Ferri, Jessica|date=January 13, 2017|access-date=February 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Friday the 13th Part III'' was theatrically released in [[3D film|3D]], and is the only film in the series to be released in that format. The film was intended to end the series as a trilogy, however, unlike many of its successors, the film did not include a moniker in its title to indicate it as such. The film was theatrically released on August 13, 1982, grossing $36.7 million at the US [[box office]] on a budget of $2.2 million, and received negative reviews from critics. It was the first film to remove ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' from the number-one box office spot and became the second highest-grossing horror film of 1982, behind ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]''. It has the third most attendance of the ''Friday the 13th'' franchise, with approximately 11,762,400 tickets sold.<ref name=seriesbo>{{cite web|title=Friday the 13th Movies at the Box Office|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=fridaythe13th.htm&adjust_yr=1&p=.htm|website=Box Office Mojo|access-date=July 17, 2017}}</ref> It was followed by ''[[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing the events [[Friday the 13th Part 2|of the night before]], a badly injured and unmasked [[Jason Voorhees]] goes to a lakefront store for a change of clothes. While there, he murders the store owner Harold and his wife Edna. Meanwhile, Chris Higgins and her friends travel to Higgins Haven, her old home on Crystal Lake, to spend the weekend. The gang includes pregnant Debbie, her boyfriend Andy, prankster Shelly, his blind date Vera (who does not reciprocate his feelings), and stoners Chuck and Chili. After running into a man named Abel who warns them to turn back, the gang meets Chris' boyfriend Rick at their destination.\n\nAt a convenience store, Shelly and Vera get into a confrontation with bikers Ali, Fox, and Loco. Shelly gets in the car and knocks down their motorcycles, impressing Vera. Later, the bikers show up at Higgins Haven, where they take the gas out of the van and attempt to burn the barn down to get even. Jason, who has been hiding in the barn, murders Fox and Loco with a pitchfork before beating Ali unconscious. That night, Chris and Rick head out into the woods, where Chris reveals that she was attacked by a deformed man two years prior, which prompted her to leave Crystal Lake in the first place; the main reason that she returned was to confront her fears and escape the trauma.\n\nBack at Higgins Haven, Shelly scares Vera with a [[goaltender mask|hockey mask]] and then wanders into the barn, where Jason slashes his throat. Taking his mask to conceal his face, Jason emerges from the barn. Vera retrieves Shelly's wallet from under the dock and is shot in the eye with a [[speargun]]. Jason enters the house and slices in half a hand-standing Andy with a machete. Debbie finishes her shower and rests on a hammock, where Jason thrusts a knife through her chest from beneath. When the power goes out in the house, Chuck goes downstairs to the basement only for Jason to hurl him into the fuse box, electrocuting him. Chili finds that everyone else is dead and is then impaled with a hot fire poker.\n\nWhen Rick's car dies, Chris and Rick are forced to walk back to the house to find it in disarray. Rick steps outside to search the grounds, but Jason grabs him and crushes his skull with his bare hands, making one of his eyes pop out of its socket. Jason then attacks Chris, who narrowly escapes the house and tries to flee in her van. The van runs out of gas and Chris makes her way to the barn to hide, but Jason attacks her again. Inside the barn, Chris strikes Jason over the head with a shovel, and hangs him. He regains consciousness and temporarily removes his mask in order to get free from the noose, which causes Chris to recognize him as the same man who attacked her two years prior. A still-living Ali tries to attack Jason, but Jason quickly finishes him off. The distraction allows Chris to strike Jason in the head with an axe. He staggers momentarily towards her before finally collapsing. Exhausted, Chris pushes a [[canoe]] out into the lake and falls asleep.\n\nChris has a nightmare of an unmasked Jason running towards her from the house before disappearing, which then turns into the decomposing body of [[Pamela Voorhees]], with her head attached, emerging from the lake to pull her in. The following morning, the police arrive and escort a traumatized Chris away from Higgins Haven. Jason's body is shown to still be lying in the barn as the lake is shown at peace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Friday the 13th characters}}\n<!---Per Credits Order--->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Dana Kimmell]] as [[Chris (Friday the 13th)|Chris Higgins]]\n* Paul Kratka as Rick\n* [[Tracie Savage]] as Debbie\n* Jeffrey Rogers as Andy\n* [[Catherine Parks]] as Vera Sanchez\n* [[Larry Zerner]] as Shelly\n* [[Richard Brooker]] as [[Jason Voorhees]]\n* David Katims as Chuck Garth\n* Rachel Howard as Chili Jachson\n* Nick Savage as Ali\n* Gloria Charles as Fox\n* Kevin O'Brien as Loco\n* Cheri Maugans as Edna Hockett\n* [[Steve Susskind]] as Harold Hockett\n* Perla Walter as Mrs. Sanchez\n* David Wiley as Abel\n* [[Betsy Palmer]] as [[Pamela Voorhees|Mrs. Pamela Voorhees]] {{dagger}}\n* [[Amy Steel]] as [[Ginny (Friday the 13th)|Ginny]] {{dagger}}\n* [[John Furey]] as [[List of Friday the 13th characters#Paul|Paul]] {{dagger}}\n* [[Steve Daskewisz|Steve Dash]] as Jason {{dagger}}\n}}\n{{dagger}} {{small|Archive footage}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nInitially, one of the earlier drafts for ''Part III'' was Ginny ([[Amy Steel]]) from the previous film being sent to a psychiatric hospital and confined there.

Using a technique called VacuForm, makeup effects director Doug White enlarged the mask and created a new mold to work with. After White finished the molds, art director Terry Ballard placed new red triangles on the mask to give it a unique appearance. Holes were also punched into the mask, and the markings were altered, making it different from Sadoff's original template.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=84\u201394}} There were two prosthetic face masks created for Richard Brooker to wear underneath the hockey mask. One mask was composed of approximately 11 different appliances, and took about six hours to apply to Brooker's face; this mask was used for scenes where the hockey mask was removed. In the scenes where the hockey mask is over the face, a simple head mask was created. This one piece mask would simply slip on over Brooker's head, exposing his face but not the rest of his head.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=84\u201394}}\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Friday the 13th Part III\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Harry Manfredini]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = January 13, 2012 (La-La Land)<br>2016 (Waxworks)\n| recorded   = 1982\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film score]]\n| length     = {{duration|m=55|s=19}}\n| label      = [[Gramavision Records|Gramavision]], La-La Land, Waxworks\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\nThe film's music was composed by [[Harry Manfredini]], who previously composed the scores of the series' first two installments.{{sfn|Lentz|2001|pages=1118\u201319}} A [[disco]] theme was also included in the film, co-written by Manfredini and [[Michael Zager]], who shared a credit with a fictional band called Hot Ice.<ref name=clm/> The theme was included on releases of the film's soundtrack, and according to Manfredini, became popular at disco and [[gay bar|gay club]]s at the time.<ref name=clm/>\n\nUpon the release of the third film in 1982, [[Gramavision Records]] released an [[LP album]] of selected pieces of Manfredini's scores from the first three ''Friday the 13th'' films.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=84\u201394}} On January 13, 2012, La-La Land Records released a limited edition 6-CD boxset containing Manfredini's scores from the first six films.
