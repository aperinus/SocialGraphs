The resulting statues are collected and then transferred to their base. At the capital city of Jasper, the Council of Women orders Sylvain to investigate. On his journey, he encounters the Deformed, a race of mutant beings who were accidentally created via [[Genetic engineering|genetic experimentation]] by Gandahar's scientists. Despite their resentment, they are also threatened by the Men of Metal and offer to help Sylvain.\n\nSylvain later saves Airelle, a Gandaharian woman. Together they discover the Men of Metal's base, where the frozen Gandaharians are taken through a large portal and are seemingly assimilated into more Men of Metal. The two stow away on a nearby boat which heads towards the middle of the ocean where they encounter Metamorphis, a giant brain. Sylvain and Airelle are captured and confronted by Metamorphis, who tells them that although the Men of Metal believe that he is their leader, he did not create them nor order their attack. He states that he does not want to see Gandahar fall, and that he needs time to figure out the connection between him and the Men of Metal. He then returns Sylvain and Airelle to Jasper where they learn that Metamorphis, like the Deformed, was also an experiment by Gandaharian scientists. Due to his rapid growth and increasingly violent behavior, he was abandoned in the ocean. Sylvain is ordered to kill Metamorphis with a special syringe. Sylvain returns to Metamorphis, who maintains his innocence but reveals that the Men of Metal come from the future via the portal Sylvain saw earlier. He then urges Sylvain to kill him in a thousand years, as the syringe would have no effect on him now. A skeptical Sylvain agrees and Metamorphis puts him into stasis.\n\nA thousand years later, Sylvain awakens just as they had agreed. He comes across the Deformed, who explain the true nature behind the Men of Metal: Due to Metamorphis's now advanced age, his cells can no longer regenerate, which drove him to create the Men of Metal and order them to go back in time to capture the Gandaharians so he could absorb their cells to continue living, killing the Gandaharians in the process. The metal comes from Metamorphis's dead cells metallizing with time. The Deformed, however, were abandoned as they were considered undesirable. Sylvain and the Deformed then agree to work together. The Deformed fight off the Men of Metal and rescue the remaining Gandaharians while Sylvain goes to face Metamorphis alone. The Deformed destroy the reservoir supplying Metamorphis with new cells, distracting him long enough to let Sylvain inject the syringe into Metamorphis which kills him. Sylvain, along with the Deformed and the Gandaharians escape through the portal back to their time.\n\n==Cast==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Character\n!Original\n!English\n|-\n!Sylvain\n|Pierre-Marie Escourrou\n|[[John Shea]]\n|-\n!Airelle\n|Catherine Chevallier\n|[[Jennifer Grey]]\n|-\n!shapeshifter/Metamorphis\n|[[Georges Wilson]]\n|[[Christopher Plummer]]\n|-\n!Ambisextra\n|[[Anny Duperey]]\n|[[Glenn Close]]\n|-\n!Blaminhor/Blaminhoe\n|Jean-Pierre Ducos\n|[[Earl Hammond]]\n|-\n!Spokesman/Council Spokeswoman\n|Christine Paris\n|[[Sheila McCarthy]]\n|}\n\n===Additional Voices===\n*Original: Za\u00efra Benbadis (Recorded Voice), Claude Degliame (Recorded Voice), Olivier Cruveiller (Man-metal), Jean-Pierre Jorris (process), Dominique Maurin-Collignon (process), Jean-Jacques Scheffer (process), Jean Saudray (process), Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Witta (process), Philippe No\u00ebl (process), Philippe Duclos (process), Jo\u00ebl Barbouth (process), Michel Charrel (process), Roland Lacoste (process)\n*English: Alexander Marshall (Apod, The Metal Man), [[Paul Shaffer]] (Optiflow), [[Earle Hyman]] (Maxum), [[Teller (magician)|Raymond Joseph Teller]] (Octum), [[Penn Jillette]] (Chief of the Deformed), [[Earle Hyman]] (Chief of the Deformed), Dennis Predovic (The Head, The Metal Man), [[Bridget Fonda]] (The Head, Historian), Chip Bolcik (The Head, The Metal Man), Sheila McCarthy (The Head), [[David Johansen]] (Shayol), [[Terrence Mann]] (The Collective Voice), Kevin O'Rourke (The Metal Man), Ray Owens (The Metal Man), Jill Haworth (Announcer), [[Jennifer Grey]] (Airelle), Charles Busch (Gemnen) and [[Glenn Close]] as Ambisextra.\n\n==Production==\nThe animation was in colour and ran for 83 minutes.
