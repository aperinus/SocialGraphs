She wants all the details so she can clean him out in a divorce action. But she is impatient and kills Ernie, taking a chance to make his business partner, Dave ([[John Lithgow]]), think he did it. Ernie and Dave worked as butchers in the Army and when they got out they ran a butcher's shop together. Dave has always been in love with Sunny - now he is convinced he has killed Ernie by accidentally locking him in a freezer. Lester Atlas, the private detective, thinks he has pictures of Ernie's lover visiting him at the shop but has actually photographed Sunny on the night she killed him.\n\n==Criticism==\nThe film was reviewed, favourably, by the eminent critic [[Pauline Kael]] in her final collection of movie reviews, ''[[Movie Love]]''. \"[[Teri Garr]] plays her role with a savage, twinkling joy. Why doesn't her skill get more recognition? This small, disingenuous comedy has been buffed to shine like a jewel; the smoothness of it keeps you giggling.\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0098042|Out Cold}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|1015742_out_cold}}\n*{{amg title|36784|Out Cold}}\n\n{{Malcolm Mowbray}}\n\n[[Category:1989 films]]\n[[Category:1989 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Malcolm Mowbray]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Michel Colombier]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]\n\n\n{{1980s-comedy-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
