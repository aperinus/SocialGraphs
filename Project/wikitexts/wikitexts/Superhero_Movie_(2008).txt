Weiss]] and [[David Zucker (filmmaker)|David Zucker]], and starring [[Drake Bell]], [[Sara Paxton]], [[Christopher McDonald]], and [[Leslie Nielsen]]. It was originally titled ''Superhero!'' as a nod to one of the Zuckers's previous films, ''[[Airplane!]]'', in which Nielsen also starred.\n\nA [[Parody|spoof]] of the [[superhero film]] genre, primarily [[Sam Raimi]]'s ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' and [[Christopher Nolan]]'s ''[[Batman Begins]]'', as well as other modern-day comic book film adaptations, the film follows in the footsteps of the [[Scary Movie (series)|''Scary Movie'' series of comedies]], with which the film's poster shares a resemblance. It was also inspired by, and contains homages to some of [[Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker]]'s earlier spoof films such as ''[[Airplane!]]'' and ''[[The Naked Gun]]''.\n\nProduction began on September 17, 2007, in Los Angeles. It was released on March 28, 2008, in the United States to generally negative reviews from critics (but more positive than earlier entries such as ''[[Date Movie]]'' and ''[[Meet the Spartans]]''), but received a moderate box office success, grossing over $71 million worldwide on a $35 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nRick Riker ([[Drake Bell]]) is an unpopular student at Empire High School. He lives with his Uncle Albert ([[Leslie Nielsen]]) and Aunt Lucille ([[Marion Ross]]), and his best friend, Trey ([[Kevin Hart]]), who is also his confidante. Rick has a crush on Jill Johnson ([[Sara Paxton]]), but she is dating bully Lance Landers ([[Ryan Hansen]]). One day, Rick and his class go on a school field trip at an animal research lab run by terminally ill businessman Lou Landers ([[Christopher McDonald]]), who is Lance's uncle. During the trip, Rick accidentally saturates himself in animal-attraction liquid, which causes a group of animals to hump him. This also leads a chemically enhanced radioactive [[dragonfly]] to fly onto Rick's neck and bite him.\n\nMeanwhile, Lou creates a machine designed to heal illness; testing it on himself, he gains perfect health at the cost of needing to drain life energy from a victim per day. To avoid arrest for murder, Lou becomes the villain Hourglass. During a [[science fair]], Rick begins to experience strange physical traits which creates a number of mishaps, and later realizes that he has developed superpowers from the dragonfly bite. Rick reveals his secret to his uncle and Trey, and an argument starts between him and Albert. The next day, while visiting the bank with Lucille, Rick accidentally allows a bank robber to make off with stolen cash. The robber then shoots and injures Albert.\n\nRick is later met by [[Charles Xavier|Xavier]] ([[Tracy Morgan]]) who takes Rick to his school for mutants, where he meets [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Invisible Woman]], [[Barry Bonds]] and Mrs. Xavier, who convince Rick to become a [[superhero]]. At home, Rick creates a superhero costume and dubs himself The Dragonfly. As Dragonfly, Rick starts watching over the city and fighting crime, quickly becoming a [[Mass media|media]] sensation, despite being unable to fly. Later, Dragonfly attempts to stop Hourglass from robbing a warehouse full of \"ceryllium\" as part of his evil plan but fails, allowing Hourglass to escape.\n\nLater that night, Jill is attacked by thieves, but Dragonfly saves her and they share a kiss. Meanwhile, Landers plans to construct a machine that will kill people and give him enough life energy to make him immortal. Later that night, Landers and Lance have dinner with Rick's family and Jill, but Landers secretly learns of Rick's true identity when he notices the same injuries on Rick as on Dragonfly. Making up an awkward excuse, he and Lance leave. Landers returns minutes later as Hourglass and kills Aunt Lucille. Albert awakens from his coma, learning about her death indirectly from his moronic doctor. After a comic funeral, Jill meets Rick and offers to begin a relationship with him. However, Rick fears Hourglass will come for Jill if they were together, and therefore rejects Jill, leaving her hurt and furious.\n\nRick decides to end his superhero career, but knowing that Hourglass would head to an awards ceremony to kill hundreds of people, he gets Albert to take him there. At the ceremony, Rick is tricked by Landers into mistaking the [[Dalai Lama]] for Hourglass, and chaos ensues. Meanwhile, Jill discovers that Landers is Hourglass. When Hourglass clashes with Dragonfly on a rooftop, he tries to activate his machine, but Dragonfly manages to kill him with a bomb that had been comically stuck onto his genitals after being thrown by Hourglass, and finally avenging Aunt Lucille's death. Jill is thrown off the side of the building by the explosion, but Dragonfly manages to grow wings and save her. Jill learns that Rick is Dragonfly due to a family ring he wears being exposed through a hole in his glove and the two begin a relationship. After being thanked for saving the city, Rick flies away with Jill, but the two are unexpectedly rammed by a passing helicopter.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Drake Bell]] as [[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|Rick Riker / Dragonfly]]\n** Sam Cohen as Young Rick Riker\n* [[Sara Paxton]] as [[Mary Jane Watson (Sam Raimi film series)|Jill Johnson]]\n* [[Christopher McDonald]] as [[Green Goblin (Sam Raimi film series)|Lou Landers / Hourglass]]\n* [[Leslie Nielsen]] as [[Uncle Ben|Albert Riker]]\n* [[Kevin Hart]] as [[Harry Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|Trey]]\n* [[Marion Ross]] as [[Aunt May|Lucille Riker]]\n* [[Ryan Hansen]] as [[Flash Thompson|Lance Landers]]\n* [[Robert Joy]] as [[Stephen Hawking]]\n* [[Brent Spiner]] as  [[Mendel Stromm|Dr. Strom]]\n*[[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Dr. Whitby\n* [[Tracy Morgan]] as [[Charles Xavier (film series character)|Professor Xavier]]\n* [[Regina Hall]] as Mrs. Xavier\n* [[Pamela Anderson]] as [[Invisible Woman|The Invisible Girl]]\n* [[Simon Rex]] as [[Human Torch]]\n* [[Craig Bierko]] as [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] (scenes cut, credit only)\n* Richard Tillman as [[Wolverine (X-Men film series)|Wolverine]]\n* [[Robert Hays]] as [[Richard and Mary Parker|Blaine]] [[Thomas Wayne|Riker]]\n* [[Nicole Sullivan]] as [[Richard and Mary Parker|Julia]] [[Martha Wayne|Riker]]\n* [[Dan Castellaneta]] as Carlson\n* [[Keith David]] as Chief Karlin\n* Marisa Lauren as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]\n* [[Miles Fisher]] as [[Tom Cruise]]\n* [[Charlene Tilton]] as Mrs. Johnson\n* Sean Simms as [[Barry Bonds]]\n* Freddie Pierce as [[Tony Bennett]]\n* Howard Mungo as [[Nelson Mandela]]\n* [[Lil' Kim]] as Xavier's daughter\n* Cameron Ali Sims as Xavier's son\n* [[Marque Richardson]] as Xavier's oldest son (uncredited)\n* [[Kurt Fuller]] as Mr. Thompson\n* [[Aki Aleong]] as [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]]\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was initially slated for theatrical release on February 9, 2007, as ''Superhero!'' under the direction of [[David Zucker (filmmaker)|David Zucker]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Sarah Levinson-Rothman | title='Scary Movie 4' Sets Box Office Record | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | date=2006-04-16 }}</ref> However, it was delayed, and the film later began production on September 17, 2007, in New York, and the director's chair was shifted to [[Craig Mazin]], with Zucker being pushed back to being a producer.<ref name=spoof>{{cite news | author=Dave McNary | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117972335.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Dimension casts 'Super' spoof | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=2007-09-19 | access-date=2008-01-31 }}</ref><ref name=sendup>{{cite news | author=Gina Piccalo | title=Superheroes to get a sendup | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=2007-09-20 }}</ref> Though the film was produced in New York, the flyover scenes used as transitions in the film use footage of the business district in downtown [[Kansas City, Missouri]].\n\nZucker said the film primarily parodied ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[Batman Begins]]'', but it also spoofed ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four (film series)|Fantastic Four]]'', and ''[[Superman film series|Superman]]''.
