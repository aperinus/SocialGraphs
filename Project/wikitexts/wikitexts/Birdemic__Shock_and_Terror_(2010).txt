Inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'', ''Birdemic'' tells the story of a romance between the two main characters as their small town is attacked by birds. It also was inspired by the environmental documentary ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'', which led to the film having an environmental message.\n\nThe film was largely self-financed and was produced through Nguyen's Moviehead Pictures company for a budget of less than $10,000. The film has gained notoriety for its poor quality, with many critics citing it as one of the [[List of films considered the worst#Birdemic: Shock and Terror (2010)|worst films of all time]].<ref name=\"huffpo\" /><ref name=\"slate\" /> After a [[Limited release|limited theatrical release]], the film was picked up for distribution by [[Severin Films]] in 2010. A sequel, ''[[Birdemic 2: The Resurrection]]'', was released in 2013. The sequel received even poorer reviews. A second sequel is in development titled ''Birdemic 3: Sea Eagle.''\n\n==Plot==\nRod is a young [[software]] [[salesman]] living a successful life in [[Silicon Valley]]. He meets up with old classmate and aspiring [[fashion model]] Nathalie and begins dating her. Things go well for the couple, with Rod receiving a large bonus that he uses to start his own business, while Nathalie is chosen as a [[Victoria's Secret]] model. As they grow closer, the couple remains oblivious to signs of something going wrong around them, such as unexplained wildfires and the carcasses of diseased birds turning up on beaches.\n\nAfter having a romantic time and kissing in a motel, Rod and Nathalie wake up to find that their town is under attack from [[eagle]]s and [[vultures]]. The birds spit acid and explode into flames upon striking the ground (having become mutated and toxic due to [[global warming]]).<ref name=\"Birdemic DVD Commentary\">''Birdemic'' DVD Commentary</ref> Rod and Nathalie escape from the motel by joining up with an ex-[[marine (military)|Marine]] named Ramsey and his girlfriend Becky. As they leave town, they rescue two young children, Susan and Tony, whose parents have been killed by the birds.\n\nThe group proceeds to drive from one town to the next, fending off more bird attacks along the way and briefly meeting a scientist named Dr. Jones studying the phenomenon. Becky is killed by the birds. Ramsey tries to save a busload of tourists. As they leave the bus, Ramsey and the tourists are killed by acid that is dropped by the birds. Nathalie stops Rod from attempting to rescue Ramsey because she fears the birds will kill him, too.\n\nRod, Nathalie, and the kids continue to flee from the birds, driving into a forest where they briefly meet a \"[[environmentalist|tree hugger]]\" named Tom Hill, who talks to them about the dangers of global warming. After escaping a forest fire, the quartet ultimately settles on a small beach, where Rod fishes for dinner. As they prepare to eat, they are attacked by the birds, but then [[doves]] appear and all the birds leave in peace. The film ends as Rod, Nathalie and the kids watch the birds fly off into the horizon.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File: Alan Bagh and Whitney Moore.jpg|thumb|right|Bagh, left, and Moore at a screening of the film]]\n{{cast listing|\n* Alan Bagh as Rod\n* Whitney Moore as Nathalie\n* Adam Sessa as Ramsey\n* Catherine Batcha as Becky\n* Janae Caster as Susan\n* Colton Osborne as Tony\n* Rick Camp as Dr. Jones\n* Stephen Gustavson as TreeHugger/Tom Hill\n* Eric Swartz as Bill Stone/CEO \n* Patsy van Ettinger as Nathalie's Mother\n* Mona Lisa Moon as Mai\n* Danny Webber as Rick\n* Laura Cassidy as News Anchor\n* Gregor Martin as News Anchor (2)\n* Fraser Jarvie as Band Member\n* Shea Clark as Band Member (2)\n* Damien Carter as Nightclub Singer\n* Tricia Pettitt as Nightclub Dancer\n* Jake Pennington as Clark \n* [[James Nguyen]] as a restaurant customer (cameo)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Birdemic bus.jpg|thumb|right|A bus featured in one sequence]]\nNguyen was inspired to write the script for ''Birdemic: Shock and Terror'' while spending time relaxing in [[Half Moon Bay]], [[California]].<ref name=\"int2\">{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/19437/|title=Video Interview with 'Birdemic' Director Part 2, New York Premiere Announced!|last=Miska|first=Brad|date=May 11, 2010|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|access-date=June 17, 2010}}</ref> The majority of the film was shot in Half Moon Bay and the area surrounding the community.

''The Birds'' starred actress [[Tippi Hedren]], who appeared in Nguyen's earlier film ''Julie and Jack.'' ''Birdemic'' includes footage of that appearance, playing on a television.\n\nThe movie contains several anti-war statements. On the DVD commentary, the director explained that one early inspiration for the movie was the anti-war movie ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', and that at the end of the movie the birds stopped their attack because they wanted to have peace and to give humans a second chance to help the environment. He said that as production continued, he became more influenced by [[Al Gore]]'s movie ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' which is about global warming. The movie was one of several in an uptick of bird horror films inspired by Hitchcock's movie, beginning in 2007 with ''[[Kaw (film)|Kaw]]'' and continuing with ''[[Flu Bird Horror]]'' in 2008.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Animal Horror Cinema: Genre, History and Criticism|editor1-last=Gregersdotter|editor1-first=Katarina|editor2-last=H\u00f6glund|editor2-first=Johan|editor3-last=H\u00e5ll\u00e9n|editor3-first=Nicklas|chapter=A History of Animal Horror Cinema|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49639-3|page=29|last1=Gregersdotter|first1=Katarina|last3=H\u00f6glund|first3=Johan|last2=H\u00e5ll\u00e9n|first2=Nicklas|doi=10.1057/9781137496393_2|date=2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring the filming of ''Birdemic'', Nguyen instructed star Whitney Moore not to socialize with her costar Alan Bagh after filming. On the commentary, Moore said they did not get permits to film at specific locations, instead just showing up, and sometimes getting kicked out. She said that at one point, they were filming on a public jogging trail, and Nguyen started yelling at joggers who were getting in the shot. Moore told him not to yell at people who were not associated with the film, and he responded by refusing to talk to her for three weeks. He gave her direction using her costar Bagh as an intermediary.<ref name=\"Birdemic DVD Commentary\"/>\n\nIn a 2021 interview, Stephen Gustavson, who played the \"treehugger\" gives credence to the notion that permits were not obtained, mentioning that during the filming of his scene, Nguyen spotted a park ranger nearby and advised the cast and crew to pretend they were having a picnic.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fantasy Friendship Podcast |website = [[Spotify]]|url=https://open.spotify.com/episode/6onl9u1EKQ9hSZ2eyV4EB1?go=1&sp_cid=96f8aefe4293e509f4c9507bd0e57a7e&nd=1}}</ref>\n\nThe film was produced with a budget of $10,000, but the distributors have spent more on marketing than it cost to produce the film and purchase the rights.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite video|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8604858.stm|title=Is Birdemic worst film ever made?|date=April 6, 2010|access-date=November 26, 2010|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> There were not many crew members on the movie, and the actors performed many of the roles that would normally be performed by crew members.
