This film parodies the 1957 science-fiction film ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Man]]'', and credited as based on [[Richard Matheson]]'s 1956 [[novel]], ''[[The Shrinking Man]]''. The original music score was composed by [[Suzanne Ciani]].\n\nThe film was released in [[pan-and-scan]] on VHS by Universal on July 13, 1994. On November 4, 2009, an unmastered low-quality DVD release (manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media) in [[Widescreen display modes|16:9 anamorphic widescreen]] was offered under the Universal ''Vault Series'' banner. It was later released by [[Shout! Factory]] as a \"Collector's Edition\" [[Blu-ray]] on November 14, 2017, with an updated transfer, and includes interviews and a deleted scene with Edith Ann, who is also played by Lily Tomlin.<ref>[http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=21646 Shout Factory: Three O'Clock High and The Incredible Shrinking Woman Coming to Blu-ray\t- Blu-ray.com]</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nPat Kramer of Tasty Meadows is an ordinary suburban housewife and mother of two children. Her husband Vance is an advertising executive. After exposure to an experimental perfume and other chemicals from her husband's company, she begins to shrink, gradually at first, then rapidly.\n\nA few weeks pass and Pat has shrunk to the height of her children. Eventually, she becomes a celebrity of sorts, appearing on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'', and captures the hearts of the American people. Soon, she is less than a foot tall, making her like a doll and forcing her to move into a dollhouse.\n\nPat is kidnapped by a group of [[mad scientist]]s, who make it seem that she perished in the kitchen garbage disposal. They plan to shrink everyone in the world by performing experiments on her to learn her secret. With the help of a kind young lab custodian and a super-intelligent gorilla named Sydney, she escapes.\n\nSpeaking of her escape to a crowd of people, she continues to shrink, saying her goodbyes before becoming microscopic in size. Vanishing from sight, she is again presumed dead, but in fact she falls into a puddle of spilled household chemicals - which return her to her original size. After her homecoming celebrating her returning to a normal size she notices that her wedding ring is now too tight while her foot is splitting her shoe open, suggesting she might ''still'' be growing.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Lily Tomlin]] as Pat Kramer/Judith Beasley\n* [[Charles Grodin]] as Vance Kramer\n* [[Ned Beatty]] as Dan Beame\n* [[Henry Gibson]] as Dr. Eugene Nortz\n* [[Elizabeth Wilson]] as Dr. Ruth Ruth\n* [[Mark Blankfield]] as Rob\n* Maria Smith as Concepcion\n* [[Pamela Bellwood]] as Sandra Dyson\n* [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]] as Tom Keller\n* Nicholas Hormann as Logan Carver\n* [[Jim McMullan]] as Lyle Parks (as James McMullan)\n* Shelby Balik as Beth Kramer\n* Justin Dana as Jeff Kramer\n* [[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]] as Sydney (as Richard A.

Baker's career, especially his early fascination with gorillas and his work in three movies featuring them, is told in the TV documentary ''Gorillas: Primal Contact.''\n\nActor [[Dick Wilson]] plays a fussy supermarket manager - much like his famous [[Charmin|Charmin tissue]] TV commercial character: [[Mr. Whipple]].\n\nThe film's writer, Jane Wagner, is Tomlin's wife and frequent collaborator.\n\nThe film started principal photography in February 1979 with [[John Landis]] directing, but was suspended after a few days, with the reason stated as budget issues. Production resumed August 13, 1979, with Joel Schumacher replacing Landis.\n\nAccording to  Landis, on an episode of Shock Waves Podcast, he wanted a trailer in theaters \"one year before ''Shrinking Woman'' comes out\" featuring [[Alfred Hitchcock]] in silhouette. The trailer would have Hitchcock speaking to the camera: \"Good evening, work is underway here at Universal Studios in Hollywood on potentially the most important motion picture of all time - ''The Incredible Shrinking Woman'' starring Lily Tomlin.\" At this point, Hitchcock would uncup his hands from his desk, and a miniature-sized Tomlin would appear underneath.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/shock-waves/id1109880594|title=Shock Waves on Apple Podcasts|website=[[iTunes]]}}</ref>\n\nActress [[Julie Brown]] has noted that Tomlin, after seeing Brown perform live, gave her her first film role by casting her in this film, thus qualifying her to receive a [[Screen Actors Guild]] membership. Her role was ultimately reduced to several seconds of non-speaking screen time.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film opened to predominantly negative reviews from critics. On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 27% based on 11 reviews, with an average rating of 4.2/10.<ref>{{cite web|title=''The Incredible Shrinking Woman''|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_incredible_shrinking_woman|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=28 July 2022}}</ref>\n\nUpon release, ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} [[Vincent Canby]] called the film: \"an amiably funny variation on Jack Arnold's classic 1957 science-fiction film, ''The Incredible Shrinking Man,'' which had been based on Richard Matheson's novel ''The Shrinking Man,''\" and went on to write that the film was \"a low-key comedy that rambles from one comic idea to the next with the slightly uneasy manner of a nightclub comedian doing a new improvisation. It succeeds in bits and pieces that are separated by long patches that are more remarkable for their good will than for their wit.\" Regarding Jane Wagner's screenplay, he wrote: \"Miss Wagner has a great talent for the kind of monologues, sketches and oddball characters that made Miss Tomlin's ''Appearing Nitely'' so memorable on Broadway, but not for creating a sustained comic narrative.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B01EFDF153BF933A05752C0A967948260 | title=The Incredible Shrinking Woman (1981) | date=January 30, 1981 | last= Canby |first= Vincent|work= [[The New York Times]] | access-date=July 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''{{'}} [[Roger Ebert]] was more enthusiastic, calling it: \"a terrific movie for kids and teenagers. It's a melancholy fact of the times we live in that any movie of even moderate ambition is supposed to become a blockbuster - and that 'family movies', with few exceptions, are inane, innocent, and boring. But The ''Incredible Shrinking Woman'' is not inane, is sometimes wickedly knowing, and is only periodically boring.\" Ebert observed that the movie was: \"also funny in its visual approach, showing us a suburban world in which everything is done in hideously jolly colors and everybody, even the TV anchorman, wears peach blazers. America in this movie looks like a gigantic paint-color chart,\" but ultimately remarked that while the movie succeeds on several levels, it does so: \"without ever breaking through to become a really inspired comedy.\"<ref>{{cite web | date=January 1, 1981 | last= Ebert |first= Roger | author-link= Roger Ebert | url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-incredible-shrinking-woman-1981 | title=The Incredible Shrinking Woman | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | access-date= August 28, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of American films of 1981]]\n* [[List of films featuring miniature people]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0082558|The Incredible Shrinking Woman}}\n* {{Amg title|24722|The Incredible Shrinking Woman}}\n* {{TCMDb title|79183|The Incredible Shrinking Woman}}\n* {{Letterboxd film|the-incredible-shrinking-woman}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|incredible_shrinking_woman|The Incredible Shrinking Woman}}\n* {{Mojo title|incredibleshrinkingwoman}}\n\n{{Joel Schumacher}}\n{{Richard Matheson}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Incredible Shrinking Woman, The}}\n[[Category:1981 films]]\n[[Category:1980s science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Richard Matheson]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on science fiction novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Joel Schumacher]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jane Wagner]]\n[[Category:Films about size change]]\n[[Category:1981 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1981 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
