The film was directed by [[Steve Rash]].\n\n== Plot==\nThe [[New York Knicks]] are also-rans in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], their roster filled with players who either lack talent or are too distracted by off-the-court issues. Nonetheless, limousine driver and rabid fan Edwina \"Eddie\" Franklin attends every Knicks game in the [[nosebleed section]] of [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\nDuring halftime of a game, Eddie is one of three fans picked to win a chance to be the honorary assistant coach of the Knicks for the second half by sinking a [[free throw]], which she does. She quickly gets on the nerves of head coach John Bailey, whom she had [[heckler|heckled]] earlier.\n\nEddie is eventually charged with a [[technical foul]] for stepping onto the court during an argument between Bailey and a referee, and she is ejected from the Garden, to the fans' dismay. Eddie's popularity piques the interest of the new Knicks owner, \"Wild Bill\" Burgess. After he forces Bailey to quit, Burgess names Eddie the new head coach.\n\nThe decision is received with skepticism and derision. However, she eventually is able to connect with the players both off and on the court to earn their respect. Eddie is able to lead the Knicks into postseason contention; the winner of their game against the [[New Orleans Pelicans|Charlotte Hornets]], now coached by Bailey, will receive the final spot in the [[NBA playoffs]].\n\nThe night before the game, Burgess tells Eddie that if the Knicks win this game, he plans to sell the team to someone who intends to move the team to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. A conflicted Eddie must decide what to do when the Knicks take a one-point lead with just a few seconds to play. Realizing the consequences, she stops the game to announce Burgess's plan to the crowd at the Garden.\n\nFaced with the possible enormous backlash from the Knicks' fans, Burgess promises the crowd he won't sell the team or move them out of New York City. When play resumes, the Hornets have one last chance to win, but [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] commits a [[Personal foul (basketball)|charge]] on the game-winning layup, nullifying the basket and giving the Knicks the victory and the playoff berth.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Whoopi Goldberg]] as Edwina \"Eddie\" Franklin\n* [[Frank Langella]] as William \"Wild Bill\" Burgess\n* [[Dennis Farina]] as Coach John Bailey\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Carl Zimmer\n* [[Lisa Ann Walter]] as Claudine\n* [[John Benjamin Hickey]] as Joe Nader\n* [[John Salley]] as Nate Wilson\n* [[Mark Jackson (basketball)|Mark Jackson]] as Darren \"Preachor\" Taylor\n* [[Malik Sealy]] as Stacy Patton\n* [[Dwayne Schintzius]] as Ivan Radovadovitch\n* [[Rick Fox]] as Terry Hastings\n* [[Greg Ostertag]] as Joe Sparks\n* Vernel Singleton as Jamal Duncan\n* [[John DiMaggio]] as construction worker\n\nPlayers from several NBA teams played major roles, including [[Alex English]] as the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]' coach, [[Dwayne Schintzius]], [[Greg Ostertag]], and [[Rick Fox]].
