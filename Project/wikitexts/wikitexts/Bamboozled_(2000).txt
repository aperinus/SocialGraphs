It features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Damon Wayans]], [[Jada Pinkett Smith]], [[Savion Glover]], [[Tommy Davidson]], [[Michael Rapaport]] and [[Mos Def]].\n\nThe film was given a [[limited release]] by [[New Line Cinema]] during the fall of 2000 and was released on [[DVD]] the following year.<ref name=\"DVDBeaver\" /> Critical reception was mixed,<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\" /><ref name=\"Metacritic\" /> and the film was unsuccessful financially, becoming a [[box office bomb]].<ref name=\"Box Office Mojo\"/> Despite its initial reception, ''Bamboozled'' later achieved [[cult film]] status for its satirical look at stereotypical depictions of [[black people]] in both historical and contemporary American film and television productions.<ref name=\"RollingStone\" />\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=July 2021}}\nPierre Delacroix (real name Peerless Dothan) is an uptight, [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-educated African-American man in the employment of television network CNS. At work, he endures torment from his boss Thomas Dunwitty, a tactless, boorish white man. Not only does Dunwitty use [[African-American Vernacular English]] (AAVE) and the word \"[[nigger]]\" repeatedly in conversations, he also proudly proclaims that he is more black than Delacroix and that he can use \"nigger\" since he is married to a black woman and has two mixed-race children. Dunwitty frequently rejects Delacroix's scripts for series that portray black people in positive, intelligent scenarios, dismissing them as \"[[The Cosby Show|Cosby clones]]\".\n\nIn an effort to escape his contract through being fired, Delacroix develops a [[minstrel show]] with the help of his personal assistant Sloane Hopkins. ''Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show'' features black actors in [[blackface]], extremely racist jokes and puns, and offensively stereotyped [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]-animated cartoons. Delacroix and Hopkins recruit two impoverished homeless street performers, Manray and Womack, to star in the show. While Womack is horrified when Delacroix tells him details about the show, Manray sees it as his big chance to become rich and famous for his tap-dancing skills.\n\nTo Delacroix's horror, not only does Dunwitty enthusiastically endorse the show, it also becomes hugely successful. As soon as it premieres, Manray and Womack become big stars, while Delacroix, contrary to his original stated intent, defends the show as [[satire (film and television)|satire]]. Delacroix quickly embraces the fame and recognition he receives while Hopkins becomes ashamed of her association with it. Meanwhile, an underground, militant [[rap music|rap]] group called the [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau Maus]], led by Hopkins' older brother Julius, becomes increasingly angry at the show's content. Though they had earlier unsuccessfully auditioned for the program's live band position, the group plans to end the show using violence.\n\nWomack quits, fed up with the show and Manray's increasing ego. Manray and Hopkins grow closer, despite Delacroix's attempts to sabotage their relationship. Delacroix confronts Hopkins, and when she lashes back at him, he fires her. She then shows him a videotaped [[montage (filmmaking)|montage]] she created of racist footage culled from assorted media to shame Delacroix into stopping production of the show, but he refuses to watch it. After an argument with Delacroix, Manray realizes he is being exploited and defiantly announces that he will no longer wear blackface. He appears in front of the studio audience, who are all in blackface, and does his dance number in his regular clothing. The network executives immediately turn against Manray, and Dunwitty fires him.\n\nThe Mau Maus kidnap Manray and announce his public execution via live [[webcast]]. The authorities work feverishly to track down the source of the internet feed, but Manray is nevertheless assassinated while doing his famous tap dancing. At his office, Delacroix (now in blackface himself, mourning Manray's death) fantasizes that the various black-themed antique collectibles in his office are staring him down and coming to life; in a rage, he destroys many of the items. The police kill all the members of the Mau Maus except for One-Sixteenth Blak, a white member who demands to die with the others.\n\nFurious, Hopkins confronts Delacroix at gunpoint and demands that he play her tape. As he does so, Hopkins reminds him of the lives that were ruined because of his actions. During a struggle over the gun, Delacroix is shot in the stomach. Hopkins flees while proclaiming that it was Delacroix's own fault that he got shot. Delacroix, holding the gun in his hands to make his wound appear self-inflicted, watches the tape as he lies dying on the floor. The film concludes with a full reveal of the tape's contents; a long montage of racially insensitive and demeaning clips of African-American characters from [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] films of the first half of the 20th century.<ref>Some of the films used in the sequence are ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'', ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]'', ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'', ''[[Judge Priest]], ''[[Ub Iwerks]]' cartoon ''[[Little Black Sambo]]'', [[Walter Lantz]]'s cartoon ''[[Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat]]'', the ''[[Screen Songs]]'' short ''Jingle Jangle Jungle'', the [[Bugs Bunny]] [[Merrie Melodies]] short ''[[All This and Rabbit Stew]]'', and, from the [[Hal Roach]] comedy ''School's Out'', ''[[Our Gang]]'' kids [[Allen \"Farina\" Hoskins]] and [[Matthew \"Stymie\" Beard]].</ref> Afterwards, Manray is shown doing his last ''Mantan'' sequence on stage.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Damon Wayans]] as Pierre \"Peerless Dothan\" Delacroix\n* [[Savion Glover]] as Manray \"Mantan\"\n* [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] as Sloan Hopkins\n* [[Tommy Davidson]] as Womack \"Sleep 'n Eat\"\n* [[Michael Rapaport]] as Thomas Dunwitty\n* [[Mos Def]] as Julius \"Big Blak Afrika\" Hopkins\n* [[Thomas Jefferson Byrd]] as \"Honeycutt\"\n* [[Paul Mooney (comedian)|Paul Mooney]] as \"Junebug\"\n* [[Craig Grant]] as \"Hard Blak\"\n* Gano Grills as \"Double Blak\"\n* [[Canibus]] as \"Mo Blak\"\n* [[Charli Baltimore]] as \"Smooth Blak\"\n* [[MC Serch]] as \"One-Sixteenth Blak\"\n* [[Kim Director]] as Starlet\n* [[The Roots]] as The Alabama Porch Monkeys\n* Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] as Himself\n\n==Production==\nMost of the film was shot on [[Mini DV]] [[digital video]], using the [[Sony]] VX 1000 camera, and later converted to film format.<ref name=\"LeeCommentary\" /> This kept the budget limited to $10 million and allowed the use of multiple cameras to simultaneously capture masters, two-shots and close-ups to save time.<ref name=\"LeeCommentary\" /> The ''Mantan: New Millenium Minstrel Show'' sequences, and their sponsor ads, were shot on [[16 mm film|Super 16]] film stock.<ref name=\"LeeCommentary\">[[Spike Lee|Lee, Spike]] (2001).
