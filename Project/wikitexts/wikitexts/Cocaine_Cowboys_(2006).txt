The film explores the rise of [[cocaine]] dealer [[Jon Roberts]], described by prosecutors as \"The [[Medellin Cartel]]'s American representative\". The film chronicles his role in the [[Miami drug war]] (the resulting crime epidemic that swept the American city of [[Miami, Florida]], in the 1970s and 1980s). The producers of ''Cocaine Cowboys'' use interviews with [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcers]], [[journalist]]s, [[lawyer]]s, former [[illegal drug trade|drug smugglers]], and [[gang]] members to provide a first-hand perspective of the Miami drug war.\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Cocaine Cowboys'' chronicles the development of the [[illegal drug trade]] in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] during the 1970s and 1980s with interviews of both law enforcement and [[organized crime]] leaders, in addition to news footage from the era. The film reveals that in the 1960s and early 1970s, [[marijuana]] was the primary import drug into the region. During the 1970s, marijuana imports were replaced by the much more lucrative [[cocaine]] imports; as more cocaine was smuggled into the United States, the price dropped, allowing it to turn \"blue collar\" and become accessible to a wider market.\n\nDrug smugglers reveal several of the different methods used to smuggle the drug into Florida. The primary methods of transport were aircraft or boats. The drug smugglers also reveal the complexity of their smuggling methods. The logistics involved included the purchase and financing of legitimate businesses to provide cover for illegal operations, the use of sophisticated electronic homing devices, and other elaborate transportation schemes.\n\nThe film also addresses the difficulty importers sometimes had storing all the money they made, as a result of which they set up a relationship with [[Manuel Noriega|Noriega]] in Panama and also bought up entire neighborhoods of houses, putting money into infrastructure as well as investing in side projects such as race horses.\n\nThe distribution networks were also highly elaborate, and many people were involved locally and nationally in the consumption of the imported cocaine. Importers reveal that condominiums were purchased near particular ocean waterways to provide a monitoring post for [[U.S. Coast Guard]] and local police patrol boats, and high-tech radio equipment was used to monitor the radio frequencies of federal, state, and local authorities in order to warn incoming boats and airplanes.\n\nThe film reveals that much of the economic growth which took place in Miami during this period was a benefit of the drug trade. As members of the drug trade made immense amounts of money, this money flowed in large amounts into legitimate businesses. Consequently, drug money indirectly financed the construction of many of the modern high-rise buildings in southern Florida. Later, when law enforcement pressure drove many major players out of the picture, numerous high-end stores and businesses closed because of plummeting sales.\n\nAlso documented in the film is the gangland violence associated with the trade. The interviewees in the film argue that [[Griselda Blanco]], an infamous crime family matriarch, played a major role in the history of the drug trade in Miami and other cities across America. It was the lawless and corrupt atmosphere, primarily from Blanco's operations, that led to the gangsters being dubbed the \"Cocaine Cowboys\".\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in April 2006, and distribution rights to the film in English speaking territories were licensed to [[Magnolia Pictures]]. The film opened in U.S. theaters with a limited release on October 27, 2006. Czech-American musician [[Jan Hammer]] of ''[[Miami Vice]]'' fame composed and performed the film's original score.\n\n==Related media==\nThe film began appearing on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] on December 7, 2007.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sho.com/site/schedules/product_page.do?seriesid=0&episodeid=130875 |title=Showtime \u2013 Movies \u2013 Cocaine Cowboys \u2013 Main<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204042330/http://www.sho.com/site/schedules/product_page.do?episodeid=130875&seriesid=0 |archive-date=2007-12-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nA revised and extended version of the film, titled ''Cocaine Cowboys: Reloaded'', was released on DVD in April 2014.<ref>{{Citation|last=Corben|first=Billy|title=Cocaine Cowboys: Reloaded|date=2014-07-08|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3845960/|accessdate=2017-01-05}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Cocaine Cowboys 2]]''\n*''[[Cocaine Cowboys: The Kings of Miami]]''\n*[[Mariel boatlift]] \n*[[Barry Seal]]\n*[[War on drugs]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite news|author=Catsoulis, Jeannette|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?res=9401E0DF153FF934A15753C1A9609C8B63 |title=Film in Review; Cocaine Cowboys|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date= October 27, 2006|accessdate= November 13, 2006}}\n*{{cite news|author=Goldstein, Gregg|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002802718 |title=Magnolia Lines Up 'Cocaine' Rights|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date= July 10, 2006|accessdate= September 13, 2006}}\n* {{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601811123,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208132912/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601811123,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 8, 2005 |title=South Florida: Trouble in Paradise|author=Kelly, James |author2=Diederich, Bernard  |author3=McWhirter, William |location=Miami|date=November 23, 1981|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |volume= 118 |number=21}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20110808083631/http://miamiasis.com/paradise-lost/ Alternative link]\n* {{cite news|url=https://www.amazon.com/Newsweek-January-MIAMI-AMERICAS-CASABLANCA/dp/B0053NW0K2 |title=Miami America's Casablanca \u2013 Israel's War at Home Confronting a New Arab Challenge|author= Kirk, Malcolm (Photojournalist)|date=January 25, 1988|journal=[[Newsweek]]|volume= CXI|number= 4}}\n*{{cite news|author=Hill, Logan|url=http://nymag.com/movies/listings/rv_54120.htm |title=Critic's Pick: Cocaine Cowboys|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date= May 4, 2006|accessdate= November 13, 2006}}\n*{{cite news|author=Korten, Tristam|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/art/media/2005-10-06/2-2.pdf|title=Big Story, Big Screen: Two Miami Documentary Flimmakers Capture a Time and Place in Cocaine Cowboys|newspaper=[[Miami New Times]]|date=October 10, 2005|accessdate=November 13, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514135856/http://www.miaminewtimes.com/art/media/2005-10-06/2-2.pdf|archive-date=May 14, 2006|url-status=dead}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://www.cocainecowboys.com/}}\n*{{Amg movie|348185|Cocaine Cowboys}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=0380268|title=Cocaine Cowboys}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=3845960|title=Cocaine Cowboys: Reloaded}}\n*{{rotten tomatoes|10007598-cocaine_cowboys}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100822181934/http://www.whentheshipcomesin.com/cocaine-cowboys-2006 ''Cocaine Cowboys''] an extended synopsis of the film\n\n[[Category:2006 documentary films]]\n[[Category:2006 films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:Cocaine in the United States]]\n[[Category:Crime in Florida]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about cities in the United States]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about Florida]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about organized crime in the United States]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about the illegal drug trade]]\n[[Category:Films about cocaine]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Miami]]\n[[Category:History of Miami]]\n[[Category:Magnolia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Miami Beach, Florida]]\n[[Category:Works about Colombian drug cartels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Billy Corben]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
