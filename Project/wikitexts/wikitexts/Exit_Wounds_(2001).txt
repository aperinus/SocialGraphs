The film is based on the book of the same name by John Westermann. The book takes place on [[Long Island]], while the film is set in [[Detroit]]. Steven Seagal plays Orin Boyd, a police detective notorious for pushing the limits of the law in his quest for justice.\n\nIt is the second of three films directed by [[Andrzej Bartkowiak]] and produced by [[Joel Silver]] that focus on [[martial arts]] based action in an urban setting with a [[hip-hop]] soundtrack and featuring many of the same cast. The film received mixed reviews from critics.<ref name=\"metacritic\" /> It earned $19 million in its opening weekend, and went on to gross a worldwide total of $79.9 million against a budget of $33 million. ''Exit Wounds'' was the final film under Steven Seagal's exclusive contract with [[Warner Bros.]]\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- [[WP:FILMPLOT]] Plot section should be 400-700 words -->\n[[Detroit Police Department]]'s detective Orin Boyd ([[Steven Seagal]]) is a cop in Detroit's 21st precinct, who saves the Vice President of the United States ([[Christopher Lawford]]) from a right-wing Michigan militant group trying to kill him. As Boyd saved the Vice President's life via disobeying orders and killing all the militants, captain Frank Daniels ([[Bruce McGill]]) transfers Boyd to the 15th precinct \u2014 Detroit's worst precinct.\n\nBoyd's new captain, former internal affairs officer Annette Mulcahy ([[Jill Hennessy]]), knows of his reputation, and she tells him that she will not tolerate it. Annette sends Boyd to an anger management class where he meets Henry Wayne ([[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]]), the high-strung host of a local talk show called ''Detroit AM''. Boyd comes across local drug dealer Latrell Walker ([[Earl \"DMX\" Simmons]]) and his fast-talking sidekick T.K. Johnson ([[Anthony Anderson]]) doing a shady deal with a man named Matt Montini ([[David Vadim]]). After a brief fight, Boyd discovers that Montini has been working undercover trying to nail Walker and Boyd ruined the sting, and that does not sit well with Montini's musclebound partner Useldinger (Matthew G. Taylor).\n\nSergeant Lewis Strutt ([[Michael Jai White]]) steps in to cool things down when Boyd gets in a fight with Useldinger. After Boyd stumbles upon the theft of $5,000,000 worth of heroin from evidence storage, Boyd and new partner George Clark ([[Isaiah Washington]]) begin focusing their efforts on Walker and T.K. Intrigued by what little they have on Walker, they investigate why he has been visiting Shaun Rollins ([[Drag-On|Mel Jason \"Drag-On\" Smalls]]). Henry discovers is that Walker is not a drug dealer. Walker is a computer expert and billionaire whose real name is Leon Rollins \u2014 he is Shaun Rollins' brother. Boyd confronts Leon, who explains that a group of corrupt cops needed a fall guy for a deal gone bad and pinned it on Shaun. It is further revealed that Strutt is the leader of the group, which also includes Montini and Useldinger. Leon and his friend Trish ([[Eva Mendes]]) have been videotaping the activities of Strutt's gang, hoping that it might help prove Shaun's innocence and get him out of jail.\n\nBoyd meets Mulcahy at a parking lot and to inform her what he has uncovered. Montini, Useldinger, and some other men try to kill Boyd and Annette. Mulcahy is killed in the chase and Boyd escapes. Boyd calls Frank and tells him that Strutt will be having a meeting at a warehouse in about an hour, to sell the heroin that was stolen. Strutt plans to try to sell it to Leon and T. K., not knowing that Leon is working against him. Frank promises that he will be there with some backup.\n\nBoyd and Daniels show up, but Strutt tells Frank to keep Boyd under control. Boyd realizes that it is Frank who is behind everything. Clark blows open the door and barges in with backup, including police chief Hinges ([[Bill Duke]]). Useldinger shoots Boyd and as he is about to shoot him again, George shoots Useldinger dead. Chief Hinges kills Frank by shooting him four times with a shotgun. After a fight with Boyd, Strutt grabs a case full of money and runs up to the roof, where a helicopter is waiting. Montini gets the upper hand in his fight with Leon after he damages Leon's vision with indigo fabric dye. Leon manages to stab Montini in the leg with a piece of broken glass, before killing him by having his neck impaled on a clothes rack. As the helicopter ladder is dragging Boyd across the roof with Strutt hanging on to the ladder, Boyd hooks the ladder to the roof; Strutt falls and is impaled on a metal pipe.\n\nAt dawn, Leon gives Hinges the videotape that proves the corruption, hoping that the tape will help prove Shaun's innocence. Hinges does not believe the courts will care about the tape, so Hinges had Shaun released from county jail about an hour before. Boyd decides to stay with the 15th precinct with George as his partner, and T.K. becomes Henry's television co-host.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Steven Seagal]] as Detective Orin Boyd\n* [[DMX]] as Leon Rollins / Latrell Walker\n* [[Isaiah Washington]] as Detective George Clark\n* [[Jill Hennessy]] as Commander Annette Mulcahy\n* [[Anthony Anderson]] as T.K.
