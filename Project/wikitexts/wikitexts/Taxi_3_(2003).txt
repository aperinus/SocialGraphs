It is the third installment in the [[Taxi (film series)|''Taxi'' film series]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Peugeot_406_Taxi_003.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Peugeot 406]]]]\n\nA group of thieves calling themselves the Santa Claus gang are wreaking havoc, using Santa Claus costumes to commit heists, and the Marseille police are, as usual, unable to keep up. Superintendent Gibert (played by [[Bernard Farcy]]) is distracted by a Chinese journalist ([[Bai Ling]]) writing a story on his squad, and is unable to stop the robbers.\n\nDetective Emilien's wife, Petra, has just announced that she's pregnant and taxi driver Daniel ([[Samy Naceri]]) is in the midst of a relationship crisis. His long suffering girlfriend Lilly has walked out on him after finding him customising his taxi at four o'clock in the morning, and complaining that their house has become a mere garage and how Daniel stopped paying attention to her.\n\nAfter a string of mistakes in which the thieves outsmart the police time and time again, the journalist is kidnapped. It is revealed that the journalist is the leader of the Santa Claus gang. The police go in search, but Emilien is captured after another botched attempt to arrest them. The journalist sets a trap; she leaves Emilien tied to a chair in an old warehouse, directly in the path of a giant ball which will crush him five minutes later.\n\nAt the last moment, Daniel rushes in with his taxi and rescues him. They track the gang to their hideout in the Swiss mountains, where the journalist and her accomplices are arrested by a crack team of Alpine troops. Gibert lands in an ice-bound lake after leaping from an aircraft with them. Petra gives birth, Daniel proposes to Lilly and a Gibert is seen being pushed around in a wheelchair covered in ice.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Samy Naceri]] as Daniel Morales \n* [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Diefenthal]] as \u00c9milien Coutant-Kerbalec\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Lilly Bertineau\n* [[Bernard Farcy]] as the Commissaire G\u00e9rard Gibert \n* [[Edouard Montoute]] as Alain \n* [[Emma Wiklund]] as Petra \n* [[Bai Ling]] as Qiu \n* [[Jean-Christophe Bouvet]] as the General Edmond Bertineau \n* Patrice Abbou as Rachid \n* Claude Sese as Planton\n* Alain David as the Minister \n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] had an uncredited [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] at the beginning of the film as a passenger to the airport.
