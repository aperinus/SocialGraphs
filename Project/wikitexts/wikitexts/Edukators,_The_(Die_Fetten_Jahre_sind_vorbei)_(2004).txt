A co-production between Germany and Austria, it stars [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]], [[Stipe Erceg]], and [[Julia Jentsch]] as three young, anti-capitalist Berlin activists involved in a love triangle. The friends, calling themselves \"the Edukators\",{{efn|\"Edukators\" is a made-up word used in the English dub. In the German version of the film, the three call themselves the ''Erziehungsberechtigten'', which roughly translates as \"The Guardians.\"}} invade upper-class houses, rearrange the furniture, and leave notes identifying themselves. Weingartner, a former activist, wrote the film based on his experiences and chose to use nonviolent characters. The film, shot in Berlin and Austria with digital hand-held cameras, was made on a low budget which Weingartner said kept the focus on the acting.\n\nFirst shown at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] on 17 May 2004 and released in its home countries later that year, ''The Edukators'' was praised by critics and audiences. It grossed more than US$8&nbsp;million worldwide and received a number of awards and nominations. It did, however, receive criticism mainly for its political statements and also for its long running time. It has become a [[cult film]], part of a \"German New Wave\", and the inspiration for real-life actions and a 2013 stage adaptation in Brazil.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in 2004, the film revolves around three young [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] activists in [[Berlin]]'s city centre: Jule ([[Julia Jentsch]]), her boyfriend Peter ([[Stipe Erceg]]) and his best friend Jan ([[Daniel Br\u00fchl]]). Jule is a waitress struggling to pay off a \u20ac100,000 debt she incurred a year ago when she crashed into a [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class]] belonging to a wealthy businessman named Hardenberg ([[Burghart Klau\u00dfner]]). After her eviction for non-payment of rent, she moves in with Peter and Jan, who are often out all night. While Peter is in [[Barcelona]], Jan tells Jule that he and Peter spend their nights \"educating\" upper-class people by breaking into their houses, moving furniture around and leaving notes saying ''\"die fetten Jahre sind vorbei\"'' (\"the days of plenty are over\") or ''\"Sie haben zu viel Geld\"'' (\"you have too much money\").\n\nAfter hearing this, Jule convinces the reluctant Jan to break into Hardenberg's home in the affluent Berlin suburb of [[Zehlendorf (Berlin)|Zehlendorf]] while he is away on business. During the break-in, the thrill of the moment entices them to kiss before Jan leaves Jule alone for a few minutes; he does not want to destroy his friendship with Peter. As she wanders around outside Jule accidentally sets off the house's floodlights, and they quickly leave.\n\nWhen Peter returns the next day, Jan and Jule do not tell him about their activities the night before. Jule realises that her mobile phone is gone, and she and Jan leave later that night to look for it in the house. After she finds it, Hardenberg walks in the door and struggles with Jule when he recognises her. Hearing them, Jan comes downstairs and knocks Hardenberg unconscious with a [[flashlight]]. Not knowing what to do, they call Peter and he comes to their aid.\n\nThe three cannot decide what to do with Hardenberg and take him to a remote, rarely used cabin belonging to Jule's uncle in the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrolean]] Austrian [[Alps]] near [[Jenbach]], overlooking [[Achensee]]. As they try to decide how to deal with their hostage, they learn that Hardenberg was a radical himself during the 1960s. A leader of the [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund|Socialist German Student Union]], he was a good friend of [[Rudi Dutschke]] before marrying, getting a good job and abandoning his ideals.\n\nAs the story progresses, political ideology and the characters' relationships become the main issues. Peter and Jan temporarily fall out over Jan's developing romance with Jule, and Hardenberg seems to regain some of his former self.\n\nThe trio finally decides that kidnapping Hardenberg was wrong and take him back to his house to let him go. As they prepare to leave, Hardenberg gives Jule a letter forgiving her debt and promising not to involve the police. The film ends with Peter, Jan and Jule asleep in the same bed as a group of heavily armed police (''[[Spezialeinsatzkommando]]''){{efn|''Spezialeinsatzkommando'' are special police forces that are essentially the German equivalent of American [[SWAT]] teams.}} gather outside their flat and knock on the door. Jule wakes up when she hears a knock, and the police force their way into the almost-empty flat. Apparently in Barcelona, Jule opens the door to a hotel maid who wishes to clean their room. In the Berlin apartment, the police find a note: ''\"Manche Menschen \u00e4ndern sich nie\"'' (\"some people never change\"). In the original German version, the Edukators set off in Hardenberg's boat in the Mediterranean, presumably to disrupt the island signal towers supplying most television programming to Western Europe.{{efn|Earlier in the film Jan proposes disrupting the towers to Peter and Jule, as he believes that Europe's youth watches too much television, which keeps them from engaging in revolutionary activities.}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and characters===\n[[File:Hans Weingartner.jpg|thumb|alt=Dark-haired, bearded, casually dressed man|Director Hans Weingartner based the film on his past as a political activist.]]\nAccording to Weingartner, ''The Edukators'' was influenced by his past as a political activist: \"There's some of me in the film\".<ref name=\"cannes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/fr/theDailyArticle/42910.html |title=Press Conference: \"Die Fetten Jahre sind Vorbei\" (\"The Edukators\") |date=17 May 2004 |publisher=[[Cannes Film Festival]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102224928/http://www.festival-cannes.com/fr/theDailyArticle/42910.html |url-status=dead |archive-date= 2 November 2014}}</ref> He considers it an autobiographical film, with Br\u00fchl playing Weingartner.<ref name=\"cineman\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cineman.ch/fr/movie/2004/DieFettenJahreSindVorbei/interview.html?interview_id=136 |title=Hans Weingartner: Hello, Germany! |last=Achour |first=Bernard |date=2004 |publisher=Cineman |language=French |access-date=3 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206104024/http://www.cineman.ch/fr/interview/weingartner-hans/136/ |archive-date= 6 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> It describes the last 10 years of his life, an attempt to find a political movement satisfying his ideals.<ref name=\"smh\" /> It also reflects his frustration over the lack of political ideals among his generation and the effect of advertising and media images.<ref name=\"abc\" /> About this, he stated, \"We don't know where to put our revolutionary energy and we don't know how to fight the system because we can't grab it, we don't know how to attack it,\" he said. \"The system has become so invulnerable because it sells revolution to us.\"<ref name=\"abc\" />\n\nThe director opted for nonviolence because violence \"only makes the system stronger\", citing the [[Baader-Meinhof]] gang which \"practically killed the Left movement in Germany&nbsp;... because they gave the police an excuse to really arm up and create a more totalitarian system.\"<ref name=\"theage\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Film/Carry-on-the-Revolution/2005/05/05/1115092620944.html |title=Carry on the Revolution |date=8 May 2005 |last=Bunbury |first=Stephanie |work=[[The Age]]  |access-date=2 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111234855/http://www.theage.com.au/news/Film/Carry-on-the-Revolution/2005/05/05/1115092620944.html |archive-date= 11 November 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Instead, Weingartner gave his characters \"poetic resistance.\"<ref name=\"pn\" />\n\nAlthough Br\u00fchl thought the film \"very realistic\", he was dissatisfied with his character's authenticity.<ref name=\"theage\" /> The actor felt \"attached\" to Jan, admiring his \"courage to want to change the way things are going, to act to defend his beliefs\",<ref name=\"cannes\" /> but thought it was \"very utopian and naive, that they take so much risk to break into some rich man's house to move things around.\"<ref name=\"theage\" />\n\nThe authenticity of the love triangle was \"very important\" to Weingartner, who was once part of such a relationship.<ref name=\"theage\" /> Although the actors were uncertain at first that Peter could forgive Jan and Jule's betrayal, Weingartner uses the situation to explore his concept of friendship: \"Friendship means more to him than bourgeois moral values.
