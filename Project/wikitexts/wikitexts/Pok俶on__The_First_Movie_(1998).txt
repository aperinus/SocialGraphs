It is the first theatrical release in the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' franchise.\n\nThe film was first released in Japan on July 18, 1998. On July 8, 1999, an {{nihongo foot|extended version|\u5b8c\u5168\u7248|kanzenban|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} of the film aired on Japanese television. In addition to an added prologue, the updated version included new animation and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] graphics.<ref name=\"dogasu\">{{Cite web |title=Mewtwo Strikes Back: The Kanzenban |url=https://dogasu.bulbagarden.net/movies/pm_mewtwo/mewtwo_strikes_back_kanzenban.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170721104510/http://dogasu.bulbagarden.net/movies/pm_mewtwo/mewtwo_strikes_back_kanzenban.html |archive-date=July 21, 2017 |access-date=September 29, 2017}}</ref> The film primarily consists of three segments: ''Pikachu's Vacation'', a 21-minute feature focusing on the series mascot [[Pikachu]]; ''Origin of Mewtwo'', the 10-minute prologue added to the extended version of the film; and ''Mewtwo Strikes Back'', the main 75-minute film feature. Overseas, the prologue can only be seen as a bonus short in DVD versions of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: Mewtwo Returns]]''. The events of the film take place during the first season of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: Indigo League]]''. The English-language adaptation was released in North America on November 12, 1999, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Bros.]]\n\nIn Japan, the film received positive reviews, with praise directed at the film's emotional impact and exploration of ethical topics such as cloning, [[genetic modification]] and existentialism. However, the English-language version received generally negative reviews from film critics, with much of the criticism pointed at the poor voice acting and its inclusion of an anti-violence message despite it being a ''Pok\u00e9mon'' film. Further retrospective criticism of the English-language version has been targeted against the removal of most of the ethical topics, such as part of Mewtwo's origin story. Despite the reviews, it was a box office success worldwide, topping the box office charts in its opening weekend, and eventually grossing over {{US$|172 million|long=no}} at the worldwide box office. It also sold 10{{nbsp}}million [[home video]] units in the United States, including 4.2{{nbsp}}million [[VHS]] sales that earned {{US$|58.8 million|long=no}} in 2000.\n\nDuring the end credits of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon the Movie: The Power of Us]]'' (2018), it was announced that a full CGI [[remake]] was set to release on the following year. It was released as ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: Mewtwo Strikes Back\u2014Evolution|Pok\u00e9mon: Mewtwo Strikes Back \u2014 Evolution]]'' in July 2019.\n\n== Plot ==\n=== ''Pikachu's Vacation'' ===\nThe Pok\u00e9mon of [[Ash Ketchum]], [[Misty (Pok\u00e9mon)|Misty]], and [[Brock (Pok\u00e9mon)|Brock]] are sent to spend a day at a [[theme park]] built for Pok\u00e9mon. [[Pikachu]], [[Togepi]], [[Psyduck]], [[Bulbasaur]], and [[Squirtle]] cross paths with a group of bullies consisting of a Raichu, Cubone, Marill, and Snubbull. The two groups compete against each other, but it leads to Ash's [[Charizard]] getting its head stuck in a pipe. Pikachu, his friends, and the bullies work together and successfully free Charizard and rebuild the park, spending the rest of the day playing before parting ways when their trainers return.\n\n=== ''Mewtwo Strikes Back'' ===\nScientist Dr. Fuji is hired by Giovanni, leader of [[Team Rocket (anime)|Team Rocket]], to utilize his expertise in [[cloning]] in order to create a [[supersoldier|living weapon]] based on an eyelash from [[mythical Pok\u00e9mon]] [[Mew (Pok\u00e9mon)|Mew]]. Fuji is revealed to be allying with Giovanni as a means to fund his side project: the resurrection of his deceased daughter Amber. In a laboratory, the weapon eventually gains sentience and is named [[Mewtwo]]. Mewtwo befriends the salvaged consciousness of Amber, named Ambertwo, as well as the clones of other Pok\u00e9mon in the laboratory. However, Mewtwo is left deeply traumatized after Ambertwo and the rest of the clones decompose and die. To stabilize him, Fuji tranquilizes Mewtwo, causing him to [[amnesia|forget]] the time he spent with his friends.\n\nAfter Mewtwo fully matures and awakens from a long slumber in a laboratory on New Island, he learns of his origin as Mew's clone from Dr. Fuji. Infuriated that Fuji and his colleagues see him as nothing more than an experiment, he unleashes his incredibly strong [[list of psychic abilities|psychic abilities]] and telekinetically destroys the laboratory, killing Fuji and the rest of the scientists. Giovanni, witnessing the carnage afar, approaches and convinces Mewtwo to work with him to further develop and perfect his mental abilities. However, after Mewtwo learns of his purpose to be a weapon for Giovanni's benefit, he escapes back to New Island where he plots revenge against humanity and Pok\u00e9mon alike.\n\nAfter Mewtwo rebuilds the laboratory and establishes a base there, he invites several trainers with hologram messages to battle the world's greatest Pok\u00e9mon trainer at New Island. Ash, Misty, and Brock receive a message and accept the invitation, but when they arrive at the port city, Old Shore Wharf, Mewtwo creates a storm, causing the boats on the wharf to be closed off for safety. As a result, Ash's group is picked up by [[Team Rocket (anime)#Team Rocket trio|Team Rocket]] disguised as Vikings on a boat. After the storm sinks their vessel in the middle of the ocean, Ash and his friends use their Pok\u00e9mon instead to reach New Island.\n\nEscorted into the island's palace by the woman who appeared on the hologram, Ash and the other trainers who were able to reach the island encounter Mewtwo. The woman is revealed to be a brainwashed [[List of Pokemon anime characters#Recurring characters|Nurse Joy]] after she is released from Mewtwo's mind control. Mewtwo challenges the trainers using cloned Pok\u00e9mon coincidentally modeled after the deceased friends from his childhood. Meanwhile, Team Rocket also reach New Island and explores its inner sanctum with a Mew innocuously following them. After Mewtwo's clones effortlessly defeat the challengers' Pok\u00e9mon, he confiscates them and expands his clone army. Ash chases after his captured Pikachu down the cloning lab, where Team Rocket's [[Meowth]] is also cloned. Ash destroys the cloning machine, frees the captured Pok\u00e9mon, and leads them to confront Mewtwo and his clones. Mew then reveals itself and Mewtwo challenges it to prove his superiority.\n\nAll of the Pok\u00e9mon originals battle their clones save for a defiant Pikachu and Meowth, who makes peace with his clone after realizing the senselessness of their fighting. Horrified at the pain and anguish felt on both sides of the battle, Ash puts himself in between a psychic blast caused by Mewtwo and Mew's fighting, leading Ash becoming [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrified]]. Pikachu tries to revive Ash with his electricity but fails. However, the tears of the Pok\u00e9mon can heal and revive Ash. Moved by Ash's sacrifice, Mewtwo realizes that he should not have to be judged by his origins but rather by his choices in life. Departing with Mew and the clones, Mewtwo turns back time to just before the trainers leave Old Shore Wharf, and erases everyone's memories of the event.\n\nBack in Old Shore Wharf, the now-restored Nurse Joy has returned to reopen the Pok\u00e9mon Center to shelter the trainers. The storm outside clears up, Ash spots Mew flying through the clouds and tells his friends of how he saw another [[Ho-Oh|legendary Pok\u00e9mon]] the day he left Pallet Town. Meanwhile, Team Rocket find themselves stranded on New Island, unable to remember how they got there, but enjoy their time nonetheless.\n\nAfter the credits, a brief scene shows Mew flying towards the mountains.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{main|List of characters in the Pok\u00e9mon anime series{{!}}List of characters in the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime series}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Character !! rowspan=\"2\" | Japanese voice actor !! rowspan=\"2\" | English voice actor\n|-\n!Japanese name\n!English name\n|-\n|[[Ash Ketchum|Satoshi]]\n|Ash Ketchum\n|[[Rika Matsumoto]]\n| [[Veronica Taylor]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pikachu\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[Ikue \u014ctani]]\n|-\n|[[Misty (Pok\u00e9mon)|Kasumi]]\n|Misty\n|[[Mayumi Iizuka]]\n| [[Rachael Lillis]]\n|-\n|[[Brock (Pok\u00e9mon)|Takeshi]]\n|Brock\n|[[Y\u016bji Ueda]]\n| [[Eric Stuart]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[Togepi]]\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[Satomi K\u014drogi]]\n|-\n|Musashi\n|Jessie\n|[[Megumi Hayashibara]]\n| Rachael Lillis\n|-\n|Kojir\u014d\n|James\n|[[Shin-ichiro Miki|Shin'ichir\u014d Miki]]\n| Eric Stuart\n|-\n|[[Meowth|Nyarth]]\n|Meowth\n|Inuko Inuyama\n| [[Maddie Blaustein]]\n|-\n|Umio\n|Fergus\n|[[Wataru Takagi]]\n| [[James Carter Cathcart|Jimmy Zoppi]]\n|-\n|Sorao\n|Corey\n|[[T\u014dru Furuya]]\n| [[Ted Lewis (voice actor)|Ted Lewis]]\n|-\n|Sweet\n|Neesha\n|[[Aiko Sato (actress)|Aiko Sat\u014d]]\n|[[Amy Birnbaum]]\n|-\n|Voyager\n|Miranda\n|[[Sachiko Kobayashi]]\n|[[Lisa Ortiz]]\n|-\n| Raymond \n|Pirate|| Raymond Johnson || Maddie Blaustein\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | [[Mewtwo]]|| [[Masachika Ichimura]]<br />[[Fujiko Takimoto]] {{small|(young; radio drama)}}<br />[[Showtaro Morikubo]] {{small|(young; anime)}} || [[Jay Goede|Philip Bartlett]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | [[Mew (Pok\u00e9mon)|Mew]]|| colspan=\"2\" | [[K\u014dichi Yamadera]]\n|-\n|Sakaki\n|Giovanni\n|[[Hirotaka Suzuoki]]\n| Ted Lewis\n|-\n|Junsar\n|Officer Jenny\n|[[Chinami Nishimura]]\n| Lee Quick\n|-\n|Joy\n|Nurse Joy\n|[[Ayako Shiraishi]]\n| [[Megan Hollingshead]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Dr. Fuji || [[Y\u014dsuke Akimoto]] || Philip Bartlett\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Narrator || [[Unsh\u014d Ishizuka]] || [[Rodger Parsons]]\n|}\n\n=== Characters exclusive to ''Pikachu's Vacation'' ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Character !! rowspan=\"2\" | Japanese voice actor !! rowspan=\"2\" | English voice actor\n|-\n!Japanese name\n!English name\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Raichu\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[Urara Takano]]\n|-\n|Bull\n|Snubbull\n|[[Naoki Tatsuta]]\n| Jimmy Zoppi\n|-\n|Mariru\n|Marill\n|[[Mika Kanai]]\n| Kayzie Rogers\n|-\n|[[Cubone|Karakara]]\n|Cubone\n|[[Chiyako Shibahara]]\n| Michael J.
