The screenplay by Wong and [[Lawrence Block]] is based on a Chinese-language short film written and directed by Wong. ''My Blueberry Nights'' stars [[Norah Jones]] (in her acting debut), [[Jude Law]], [[David Strathairn]], [[Rachel Weisz]], and [[Natalie Portman]].\n\nThe cinematographer of this film was [[Darius Khondji]]. [[Christopher Doyle]] was Wong's cinematographer for his last seven features before ''My Blueberry Nights'', starting from ''[[Days of Being Wild]]'' (1990).\n\n==Plot==\nJeremy, an [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]] from [[Manchester]], owns a small New York City caf\u00e9. It becomes a haven for Elizabeth, as he provides her with clues which soon reveal that her boyfriend is cheating on her. Devastated, she leaves, but returns for solace and to share stories.\n\nJeremy explains his bowl of keys, and the story behind each, while she gluttonously eats his blueberry pie until she falls asleep. He tries to steal a kiss while Elizabeth sleeps, and she pretends to continue sleeping. But after the kiss she subtly smiles, but he doesn't see it. Elizabeth leaves Jeremy's caf\u00e9 and he puts the key to her and her ex's in the key bowl.\n\nElizabeth, now calling herself Lizzie, eventually drifts to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where she takes two jobs, waitress by day and barmaid by night, to earn enough money to finance the purchase of a car. She regularly sends postcards to Jeremy, taking a liking to him, without revealing where she lives or works and, although he tries to locate her by calling all the restaurants in the area, he fails to find her. Later on, he decides to send out postcards to any restaurants she may be at to try to find her.\n\nOne of Lizzie's regulars at both jobs is local police officer Arnie Copeland, an alcoholic who cannot accept his wife Sue Lynne has left him. She flaunts her debauchery by openly socializing with a younger man. He shows Lizzie his many attempts at getting sober have not worked, with a pocket full of [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] sobriety tokens.\n\nOne night off duty in Lizzie's bar, Arnie drunkenly threatens Sue Lynne with his gun if she leaves. Later on, he drives drunk, crashing into a pole and dies. Lizzie comforts Sue Lynne at the crash site, also where she had met him, suggesting he may have committed suicide. Before both women say goodbye to the town, Sue Lynne gives her Arnie's tab money, admitting she had made a mistake and she misses him.\n\nHeading west, Elizabeth \u2013 now Beth \u2013 gets another server job at a [[casino]] in a small town in [[Nevada]]. Here she meets Leslie, an inveterate [[poker]] player who has lost all her money. Beth lends her her $2200 in exchange for the money back, plus a third of her winnings or her car, a new [[Jaguar XK]], if she loses. When she loses, she fulfills her promise by giving Beth her Jaguar, but asks for a lift to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] to borrow money from her father, whom she has not seen in a long time.\n\nEn route, a call comes from a Vegas hospital informs Leslie her father has been admitted and is dying. She believes the call is a ruse to lure her back, but upon arrival she discovers he actually died the previous night. Leslie announces she's keeping the car, which she had stolen from her father. He had sent her the title and registration despite their estrangement. She confesses she actually won the poker game and subsequently helps Beth negotiate the purchase of her dream car.\n\nElizabeth returns to [[Manhattan]] and the caf\u00e9, where Jeremy has had a stool at the counter reserved for her ever since she left. As she eats a slice of blueberry pie, Elizabeth realizes her feelings for him are reciprocated. She 'passes out' on the counter after spending the night in conversation. Jeremy again steals a kiss while she is asleep, but now she returns the kiss as the film ends.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Norah Jones]] as Elizabeth (Lizzie/Beth)\n* [[Jude Law]] as Jeremy\n* [[David Strathairn]] as Arnie Copeland\n* [[Rachel Weisz]] as Sue Lynne Copeland\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as Leslie\n* [[Cat Power|Chan Marshall]] as Katya\n* John Malloy<!-- http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1685181/ --> as Diner Manager\n* Demetrius Butler as Male Customer\n* [[Frankie Faison]] as Travis\n* [[Adriane Lenox]] as Sandy\n* [[Benjamin Kanes]] as Randy\n* Michael Hartnett as Sunglasses\n* Michael May as Aloha\n* Chad Davis as Boyfriend\n* Katya Blumenberg as Girlfriend\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe idea for ''My Blueberry Nights'' originated from an [[anthology film]] that Wong planned to make under the title ''Three Stories About Food''; one of the film's chapters was ultimately released as its own film, ''[[In the Mood for Love]]'' (2000), while ''My Blueberry Nights'' originated from another short film titled ''In the Mood for Love 2001'', which had only been screened once, at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2001. Wong expanded the idea into a road movie that would take place in other locations besides New York, as filming entirely in the state would have been too expensive. Wong chose to make the film in 2005, after the postponement of another film.<ref name=NYT/>\n\n===Pre-production===\nCrew members went on three [[location scouting]] trips across the United States. [[Darius Khondji]], the film's [[cinematographer]], accompanied the crew on two trips, while Wong accompanied them for one; both of them took extensive photographs of diners, highways, and motels during their trips. [[Ely, Nevada]] was discovered by Wong while traveling along [[U.S. Route 50]], and was chosen as a filming location.<ref name=NYT/> Ely's [[Hotel Nevada and Gambling Hall]], as well as its Liberty Club bar, were scouted as possible filming locations.<ref name=HotelNV/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thirteen.org/reel13/blog/a-scouting-life/marlboro-man-at-the-liberty-club/|title= Marlboro Man at the Liberty Club|last= Hutchins|first= Sam|date= March 18, 2010|website= Thirteen.org|access-date=December 9, 2016}}</ref> [[New Orleans]] was also considered as a filming location, but ultimately was not chosen because of logistical reasons; [[Memphis, Tennessee]] was chosen instead.<ref name=NYT/>\n\nIn ''Making My Blueberry Nights'', a bonus on the DVD release of the film, Wong reveals his first choice for Elizabeth was singer [[Norah Jones]] despite her lack of prior acting experience.

[[Jude Law]] called it \"a living story that's still being decided.\"<ref name=NYT/>\n\nIn August 2006, filming took place at the Palacinka caf\u00e9 on Grand Street in [[SoHo, Manhattan]].

It's extraordinary how he'll take a moment and replay it and slice it up.\"<ref name=NYT/>\n\nFilming was completed in seven weeks. Wong returned to Hong Kong in September 2006, with most of the film finished. [[The Weinstein Company]] acquired the American distribution rights in November 2006, while the film was being edited by Wong and William Chang. Wong said he would probably return to the United States to conclude filming in the winter, but stated that he would not make a decision about additional filming until he had a first cut.

But at 90 minutes, it's short enough to be carried along on the drama of its individual scenes and the strength of its performances . . . The nice thing about Wong is that, like a good gambler, he knows when to bet the farm and when to hold back. Most of the time, he plays it straight, and other times he will speed up the action into a kind of blur, to indicate time passing; or he'll fade out and back into the same shot, as though to indicate renewed focus. Everything he does re-creates a state of mind. It's such a relief to realize he's doing everything for a reason and not to show off.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/04/18/DD46105VIB.DTL|title=Movie review: Wong's passionate 'Blueberry'|date=April 18, 2008}}</ref>\n\nMeghan Keane of the ''[[New York Sun]]'' said the film \"keenly displays Wong Kar Wai's aptitude for relationship drama and showcasing the female form, but the Chinese director's American debut often makes the earnest miscalculation of a dubbed foreign film . . . [I]n translating his fascination with the distances between two people into American vernacular, Mr. Wong betrays an unfamiliarity with his subject matter that often undermines his story . . . Sadly, [his] interpretation of American lives and landscapes has an alien quality to it. He fetishizes the American countryside, drowns his characters' sorrows in whiskey, and makes plot-oriented decisions based on aesthetics rather than continuity or logic. The image of beautiful women in oversize sunglasses leaning against convertibles is not an accurate depiction of Americana \u2013 but it doesn't make for a bad visual.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/on-the-road-with-a-translator/74160/|title=On the Road, With a Translator \u2013 The New York Sun|website=nysun.com}}</ref>\n\nIn Hong Kong, critical reception was generally mixed.
