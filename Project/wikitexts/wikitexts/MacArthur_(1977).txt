It is recounted in [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] as MacArthur visits [[West Point]] in 1962.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gregory Peck]] as [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]]\n* [[Ed Flanders]] as President [[Harry S. Truman]]\n* [[Dan O'Herlihy]] as President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]\n* [[Ivan Bonar]] as Lieutenant General [[Richard K. Sutherland]]\n* [[Ward Costello]] as [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[George Marshall|George C. Marshall]]\n* [[Nicolas Coster]] as Colonel Sidney Huff\n* [[Marj Dusay]] as Mrs. [[Jean MacArthur]]\n* [[Art Fleming]] as  [[W. Averell Harriman]]\n* [[Russell Johnson]] as [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]] [[Ernest J. King]]\n* [[Sandy Kenyon]] as Lieutenant General [[Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV|Jonathan M. Wainwright]]\n* [[Robert Mandan]] as Representative Martin\n* [[Allan Miller]] as Colonel [[LeGrande A. Diller]]\n* [[Dick O'Neill]] as Major General [[Courtney Whitney]]\n* [[G. D. Spradlin]] as Major General [[Robert L. Eichelberger]]\n* [[Addison Powell]] as [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]] [[Chester W. Nimitz]]\n* [[Garry Walberg]] as Lieutenant General [[Walton Walker]]\n* [[James Shigeta]] (''[[deleted scene]]s'') as [[Tomoyuki Yamashita|General Tomoyuki Yamashita]]\n\n==Production==\nGregory Peck said, \"I admit that I was not terribly happy with the script they gave me, or with the production they gave me which was mostly on the back lot of Universal. I thought they shortchanged the production.\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTOHrl8MNVI Gregory Peck Interview with Jimmy Carter] on [[YouTube]]</ref>\n\n==Historical inaccuracies==\n* In a meeting in [[Pearl Harbor]] between President Roosevelt, Admiral Nimitz, and MacArthur to discuss East Asian strategy, MacArthur points to Lingayen Gulf in Western Luzon, calling it Leyte Gulf and referring to it as the site of his re-entry to the Philippines. The [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] and the [[Battle of Leyte]], which included MacArthur's first return to Philippine soil on 20 October 1944, were in the Visayas, in [[Central Philippines]]. The [[Invasion of Lingayen Gulf]], with MacArthur making a similarly-dramatic landing in the main island of Luzon, occurred on January 9, 1945.\n* On the ship's stateroom wall of the Roosevelt, Nimitz, and MacArthur meeting on Pearl Harbor is a painting of the {{Sclass|Baltimore|heavy cruiser}} {{USS|Los Angeles|CA-135|6}}. However, it was commissioned only on 22 July 1945 and so was not used for World War II. However, it won five battle stars during the Korean War.\n* The uniform of the Soviet Lieutenant General Kuzma N. Derevyanko is erroneously presented with the shoulder boards of a Soviet senior lieutenant instead of a lieutenant general.<ref>https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/+AlexanderViduetsky/albums/6019713833874765057 {{Dead link|date=August 2022}}</ref>\n* The [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Japanese surrender of World War II]] scene aboard {{USS|Missouri|BB-63}} shows the battleship's 40&nbsp;mm quad guns covered (mothballed) during the movie.\n* When MacArthur and his aides are planning the [[Battle of Inchon|U.N. landing at Inchon]] in 1950, they review a map of the Korean peninsula which shows the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|current armistice line]] dividing the two Koreas.  That line would not be established until 1953.  Their map should have been showing the original line at the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]].\n\n==Reception==\n''MacArthur'' received mixed reviews, it currently holds a 63% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{Rotten Tomatoes|macarthur|MacArthur}}</ref>\n\nThe film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in the following lists:\n* 2003: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains]]:\n** [[Douglas MacArthur|General Douglas MacArthur]] \u2013 Nominated Hero<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/handv400.pdf |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains Nominees |access-date=2016-08-06}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Inchon (film)|Inchon]]'', another film featuring MacArthur .\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0076342|MacArthur}}\n* {{AFI film|55892|MacArthur}}\n* {{TCMDb title|420354|MacArthur}}\n* {{Letterboxd film|macarthur}}\n* {{AllMovie title|30579|MacArthur}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|macarthur|MacArthur}}\n\n{{Joseph Sargent}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:MacArthur}}\n[[Category:1977 films]]\n[[Category:1970s biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s war films]]\n[[Category:American biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:American war films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about military leaders]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Jerry Goldsmith]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Joseph Sargent]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1942]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1943]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1944]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1945]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1946]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1947]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1948]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1949]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1950]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1951]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1952]]\n[[Category:Films set in Japan]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Korean War films]]\n[[Category:Pacific War films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Matthew Robbins]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:World War II films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films about Douglas MacArthur]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Franklin D.
