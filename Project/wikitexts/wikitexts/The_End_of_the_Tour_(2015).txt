The film stars [[Jason Segel]] and [[Jesse Eisenberg]], was written by [[Donald Margulies]], and was directed by [[James Ponsoldt]]. Based on [[David Lipsky]]'s best-selling memoir ''[[Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself]]'', screenwriter Margulies first read the book in 2011, and sent it to Ponsoldt, a former student of his, who took on the job of director. Filming took place in early 2014 in [[Michigan]], with scenes also shot at the [[Mall of America]]. [[Danny Elfman]] provided the score, with the soundtrack featuring songs by musicians like [[R.E.M.]] and [[Brian Eno]], whose inclusion was based on the kind of music Wallace and Lipsky listened to.\n\nThe film debuted at the [[List of films at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival|2015 Sundance Film Festival]], and was theatrically released on July 31, 2015, by [[A24]] to critical acclaim, particularly for the performance of Segel. He received Best Actor nominations from various awards groups, including the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead]].\n\n==Plot==\nWriter [[David Lipsky]] is dismayed to hear about the [[suicide]] of novelist [[David Foster Wallace]] in 2008. He had interviewed the author over a period of days twelve years earlier, following the publication of Wallace's novel ''[[Infinite Jest]]'', which received critical praise and became an international bestseller, a touchstone for numerous readers. He listens to the recordings he made during their time together.\n\nThe film returns to the period shortly after the book's release. Although initially skeptical of the high praise Wallace's book is receiving, Lipsky \u2013 a writer having only marginal success \u2013 is awestruck after reading it. He persuades his editor at ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine to give him an assignment to interview Wallace during his book tour.\n\nThe journalist travels to meet Wallace at his home on the outskirts of [[Bloomington-Normal, Illinois]] (near [[Illinois State University]] where the author teaches writing). Lipsky finds the young author unassuming and amiable, but indifferent to being interviewed. Wallace permits Lipsky to tape-record their conversations, with the proviso that Lipsky won't use any direct quotes which Wallace asks to have taken \"off the record\" five minutes later. Wallace opens up to Lipsky on a variety of subjects, ranging from dogs to television to fame and self-identity, but remains somewhat guarded. He tacitly admits to [[alcoholism]], but offers few details of his experience. Lipsky's mention of Wallace's brief voluntary institutionalization under a suicide watch causes some friction between them.\n\nAs their conversation continues late into the night, Wallace invites Lipsky to stay in his unused \"guest room\", rather than a motel. The room is dominated by stacks of his books. They resume the interview in the morning. Lipsky also accompanies Wallace for a few days to [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul]], where Wallace has the final appearance of his book tour. There they meet two women friends of Wallace: Betsy, whom he knew in graduate school, and Julie, a literary critic; the men spend time with the women later that night and the next day at the [[Mall of America]]. Although Wallace and Lipsky generally get along well, Wallace becomes angry when he sees Lipsky flirting with Betsy.\n\nAfter their return to Wallace's home, tension increases when Lipsky asks the author about rumors of past [[heroin]] abuse. Wallace denies it, accusing Lipsky of looking for a stereotypical angle from which to write his article. As their time comes to an end, the two spend a morning together, mainly as new friends rather than as journalist and subject. Lipsky summons the nerve to give Wallace a copy of his own novel, and they agree to stay in touch.\n\nThe closing passage is set fourteen years later, when Lipsky is on his own book tour. He reads from his memoir, ''[[Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself]]'' (2010), based on their 1996 encounter. He recounts the road trip he had with Wallace, reflecting on ideas the two had discussed and how their conversations made Lipsky less lonely.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jason Segel]] as [[David Foster Wallace]]\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as [[David Lipsky]]\n* [[Ron Livingston]] as Bob Levin\n* [[Anna Chlumsky]] as Sarah\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Patty Gunderson\n* [[Mickey Sumner]] as Betsy\n* [[Mamie Gummer]] as Julie\n* [[Becky Ann Baker]] as Bookstore manager\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:James Ponsoldt at the premiere of Sorry for Your Loss at Toronto International Film Festival - Edited.png|thumb|right|170px|[[James Ponsoldt]] was sent the screenplay by screenwriter [[Donald Margulies]], who was also Ponsoldt's former professor at [[Yale University]].]]\nLipsky's 2010 memoir ''[[Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself]]'' was a ''New York Times'' bestseller and an [[NPR]] Best Book of the Year.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Syme |first=Rachel |date=2010-12-21 |title=Weird And Wonderful Books: 2010's Hidden Gems |language=en |work=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/07/15/131915812/the-weird-and-the-wonderful-2010s-hidden-gems |access-date=2022-10-14}}</ref> Lipsky also received the [[National Magazine Award]] in 2009 for writing about David Foster Wallace.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mokoto |first=Rich |date=June 27, 2009 |title=Book Expected on David Foster Wallace |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/27/books/27arts-ANOTHERBOOKE_BRF.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127171007/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E7DB1638F934A15755C0A96F9C8B63 |archive-date=January 27, 2018 |access-date=February 18, 2017 |website=The New York Times}}</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's [[Lev Grossman]] wrote, \"the transcripts of their brilliant conversations read like a two-man [[Tom Stoppard]] play,\"<ref>{{cite news |author=Grossman, Lev |date=April 16, 2010 |title=Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref> and NPR's Michael Schaub called the book \"crushingly poignant&nbsp;... startlingly sad yet deeply funny.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Schaub |first=Michael |date=May 4, 2010 |title=A Not-So-Brief Interview With David Foster Wallace |work=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/2010/05/04/126483112/a-not-so-brief-interview-with-david-foster-wallace |url-status=live |access-date=2010-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914012540/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126483112 |archive-date=September 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, [[Pulitzer Prize]]\u2013winning playwright Donald Margulies read the memoir. \"Here was a story of two men circling each other,\" Margulies told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news |author=Zeitchik, Steven |date=July 22, 2015 |title=How 'End of the Tour' became a very David Foster Wallace kind of film |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-tour-david-foster-wallace-20150726-story.html |access-date=2022-10-14}}</ref> \"It was all there.\" He wrote a screenplay based on Lipsky's book. A few lines were additionally inspired by Wallace's posthumous novel [[The Pale King]].\nMargulies included material that Lipsky shared with him about time with Wallace off-tape and which he had not included in his memoir. Margulies pointed out, \n<blockquote>\"What Lipsky shared with me is that moment that some people have accused me of creating. As being too Hollywood. [Laughs]. When in fact it was something that Lipsky didn\u2019t include in his book because he felt that it got in the way of Wallace\u2019s voice. Because that was really what he was trying to convey in that book... That moment that occurs between the two guys in Julie\u2019s kitchen, I wouldn\u2019t have known if David Lipsky hadn\u2019t shared that with me. Not to sound too coarse about it, but it provided me with my third act. Because it\u2019s a turn that occurs. A schism that occurs that changes the tenor of what follows. Dramatically speaking, I felt that that was absolutely necessary. And serendipitous that such a thing actually occurred, and that David Lipsky was generous enough to share it with me, and gave me permission to include it in the film. So there were things that I pulled to it that were not in the book. But certainly not anything that didn\u2019t happen.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Mintz |first=Daniel H. |date=August 27, 2015 |title=The End of the Tour: A Road Trip with David Foster Wallace |url=https://www.creativescreenwriting.com/the-end-of-the-tour-a-road-trip-with-david-foster-wallace/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910224453/https://www.creativescreenwriting.com/the-end-of-the-tour-a-road-trip-with-david-foster-wallace/ |archive-date=September 10, 2015 |access-date=August 28, 2015 |website=Creative Screenwriting}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMargulies sent the completed script to [[James Ponsoldt]], his former student at Yale University and a [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] Award-winning director.
