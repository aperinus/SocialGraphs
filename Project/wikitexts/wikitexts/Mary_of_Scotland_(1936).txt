While it is true that Bothwell was well known as a philanderer, his last marriage to Mary was genuine. Regarding Mary's historical status, the false imprisonment by Elizabeth I and Anglo Protestant intrigue in Scotland did undermine her claim to the throne of Scotland and the throne of England, making her a direct threat to Elizabeth I.\n\nAt the beginning of the movie, Mary is described as the legitimate heir of [[King Henry VII of England]], when in fact she was the heir of [[King James V of Scotland]].\n\n== Reception ==\n[[File:Hepburn mary of scotland.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Hepburn in a publicity still from film]]\nContemporary reviews were generally positive.
