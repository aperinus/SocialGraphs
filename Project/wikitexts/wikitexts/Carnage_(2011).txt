Reilly]].\nIn this [[comedy of errors]], two sets of parents try to resolve a situation in a civilised manner as their idiosyncrasies rise to the surface.\n\n''Carnage'' premiered at the [[2011 Venice International Film Festival]] on 1 September 2011, where it competed for the [[Golden Lion]]. It was theatrically released on 18 November 2011. The film received positive reviews, with critics praising the performances of Foster and Winslet and Polanski's direction.\nAt the [[69th Golden Globe Awards]], Foster and Winslet received nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]]. As of 2022, it is Polanski's last film to be shot in English until his upcoming film ''[[The Palace (2022 film)|The Palace]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen two grade-school boys get into a fight in the park that results in one boy, Zachary Cowan, hitting the other, Ethan Longstreet, in the face with a stick, their parents meet in a [[Brooklyn]] apartment to discuss the matter. Zachary's parents, Alan ([[Christoph Waltz]]) and Nancy Cowan ([[Kate Winslet]]), visit the home of Michael ([[John C. Reilly]]) and Penelope Longstreet ([[Jodie Foster]]), Ethan's parents. Their meeting is initially intended to be short, but due to various circumstances, the conversation continues to draw out.\nIn fact, Alan and Nancy begin to leave the apartment on two occasions, but are drawn back in to further discussion.\n\nAt first, the couples are friendly to each other, but their respective comments start to hurt feelings, making everyone argue with one another. Apart from fighting amongst themselves, the couples blame each other about who is responsible for the fight between their sons. Nancy calls the Longstreets \"superficially fair-minded\" and Penelope and Michael complain about Alan's arrogant and dull attitude. Everyone also gets irritated with Alan when he accepts endless business phone calls on his [[BlackBerry]], interrupting the discussion, and showing he has more interest in his business problems than the matter at hand. Michael also receives many phone calls from his ailing mother, to his frustration.\n\nNancy accuses Michael of being a murderer because he, annoyed by the constant noise it made during the night, had earlier turned his daughter Courtney's pet hamster loose in the street. Penelope becomes emotional about the hamster and with everyone arguing with each other. Other issues include a risky drug Alan is working to defend and Michael's mother has been prescribed, and the question of idealism and responsibility that is part of Penelope's current work.\n\nMichael offers everyone a glass of fine scotch. Penelope claims she doesn't \"get drunk\" and Nancy drinks way too many and finally stops Alan's phone calls by dropping his cellphone in Penelope's flower vase full of tulips and water. Penelope and Nancy both laugh uproariously while Michael and Alan try to blow-dry the BlackBerry.\n\nThe conversation continues to decay into personal attacks and opinionated statements and, eventually, epithets are uttered. Penelope is ranting, calling Nancy's son a 'snitch', and Nancy's true colors are revealed when she destroys the tulips and drunkenly and vulgarly states she is glad that her son beat up Penelope's and Michael's son. The couples realize the conversation is going nowhere. Alan's BlackBerry, lying on the coffee table, vibrates, and all four stare at it.\n\nThe film cuts to the hamster, alive and well in the park, where Ethan and Zachary are reconciling on their own.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Penelope Longstreet\n* [[Kate Winslet]] as Nancy Cowan\n* [[Christoph Waltz]] as Alan Cowan\n* [[John C. Reilly]] as Michael Longstreet\n* Elvis Polanski as Zachary Cowan\n* Eliot Berger as Ethan Longstreet\n* [[Julie Adams]] as Alan\u2019s secretary\n* [[Roman Polanski]] as a neighbor (uncredited [[cameo appearance|cameo]])\n\n==Production==\nAlthough set in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York State|New York]], the film was shot in [[Paris]], because of Polanski's [[Fugitive|fugitive status]]. The opening and closing scenes, ostensibly filmed in [[Brooklyn Bridge Park]], were shot in France against a green screen. Polanski's son Elvis, seen only in [[long shot]]s in the opening and closing scenes, portrays the Cowans' son. Actress [[Julie Adams]] (famous for ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'') voices Alan Cowan's secretary on the phone, and was a dialect coach for Waltz.<ref>End credits.</ref>\n\nThe apartment, in which almost the whole film takes place, was designed in a sound studio on the outskirts of Paris. Production designer [[Dean Tavoularis]] placed a priority on making the set look authentically American, having numerous products and appliances shipped from the US, and renting American ironmongery for the doors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/ad/set-design/2012/carnage-movie-set-design-article |work=Architectural Digest |title=On the set of ''Carnage'' |author=Stephen Wallis |date=2012 |access-date=2014-06-20 |publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/2300-207_162-10009262.html|work=[[CBS News]]|title=\"Carnage\" premieres at Venice Film Festival|date=2011-09-01}}</ref> The film was released in the United States on 16 December 2011 by [[Sony Pictures Classics]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/sony-pictures-classics-to-distribute-polanskis-carnage |title=Sony Pictures Classics to Distribute Polanski's 'Carnage' |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=14 April 2011 |access-date=16 April 2011 |author=Itzkoff, D.}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n''Carnage'' received generally positive reviews from critics.
