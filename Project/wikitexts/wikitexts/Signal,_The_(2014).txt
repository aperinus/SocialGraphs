The film stars [[Brenton Thwaites]] and [[Laurence Fishburne]]. It premiered at the [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]], and was theatrically released in the United States on June 13, 2014.<ref name=\"release\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nThree [[MIT]] students \u2013 Jonah, Nic, and Haley \u2013 are on a road trip to move Haley to California, a decision that stresses Nic's relationship with Haley. Nic walks with [[forearm crutches]], and the possibility of  [[muscular dystrophy]], [[multiple sclerosis]], or some other degenerative disease is implied but never specified. Haley feels Nic is distancing himself from her and Nic explains he does not want his disability to hold her back. During their stay in a hotel, Nic and Jonah discover that a [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] named NOMAD, who nearly got them expelled for breaking into MIT servers, has found their location and is taunting them with strange and ominous e-mails. They track NOMAD to an abandoned house in the middle of [[Nevada]] and decide to go after him. After finding nothing in the house, Nic and Jonah hear Haley scream and run outside, only to see her pulled into the sky before disappearing into a white light themselves.\n\nNic, now with the number 2.3.5.41 tattooed on his arm, wakes up in a strange and sterile underground research facility where he is questioned by Dr. Wallace Damon, the head of the \"transition group\" in charge of helping Nic to cope with his strange situation. Damon tells Nic what they encountered near the house was an EBE: an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] biological entity. Nic remains in a state of disbelief. Dr. Damon then shows him footage from Nic's own video camera and pauses where an alien face can be seen peering from behind a tree. Nic is taken to his room where he hears Jonah talking to him through a small vent in the wall, saying \"(his) body feels weird.\" Nic also notices that his legs, previously weak but functional, are now completely numb. When Dr. Damon questions him again, Nic tries to get answers about Haley's condition (who is in a coma at the time), but is unsuccessful. Following an unexplained experiment on a cow in another part of the facility, a security alarm goes off and Nic, along with other personnel, finds large dents with scorch marks running across the walls and no sign of Jonah. Nic asks Damon where Jonah went but Damon tells him that Jonah was never recovered from the house. Increasingly agitated, Nic tries to break Haley out but is intercepted. After being restrained, he is shocked to discover that his legs have been amputated and replaced by prostheses made from alien technology. Nic then uses these super-powered limbs to break Haley and himself out of the facility, only to discover they are in the middle of a vast barren desert.\n\nAfter hitching a ride with an old lady who seems sweet yet oddly troubled, Nic and Haley hijack an 18-wheeler truck to try to find a way around the seemingly endless canyon that extends around the facility and surrounding area. At a visitors center, they come across Jonah disguised as one of the facility workers dressed in a white [[hazmat suit]]. Jonah reveals that he too had limbs taken from him, as his forearms and hands have been replaced with the same alien technology as Nic's legs. Jonah speculates that they are in [[Area 51]] (because they both have the same tattooed number, which adds up to 51), and that this is all a test. After Nic discovers indications of alien technology also implanted in Haley's spine, the trio drive up to a military checkpoint. Jonah then tries to hack into their computer system, only to be stopped by a hail of gunfire from the facility personnel, which causes damage to his eyeglasses and ruins his ability to see the computer correctly. Nic and Jonah hug as the fatally wounded Jonah prepares for his final stand that will allow Nic and Haley to escape. Jonah uses his remaining strength and prosthetic alien arms to subdue the group of soldiers. However, Nic and Haley's escape is short-lived; as they approach the only bridge that would take them over the canyon to the outside world, they run into Damon and his military men, who blow out the truck's tires. Haley is evacuated by helicopter beyond the canyon and, knowing that Nic has mastered the use of his legs, Damon tells Nic \"you can't reach her.\" After hearing a loud horn coming from the sky, Nic realizes that Damon is NOMAD (Damon spelled backwards). Damon then explains that it was Nic who came looking for ''him'', that this was his fault, and adding that Nic is \"the perfect integration of human will and alien technology. Our finest achievement.\" Agitated and emotionally compromised, Nic's bionic legs enable him to sprint at [[supersonic speed]] across the bridge where he hits an invisible barrier and breaks through.\n\nNic finds himself inside what appears to be a different, larger exterior facility. Housed within it, through the broken barrier, can be seen 'Area 51\", the Earth-like world with the canyon city.  Looking in through the hole towards the bridge, he sees Damon walk up and remove his helmet to reveal that he is actually a robotic alien, with merely a human-like face. Nic turns back around, and through the glass sees stars and [[outer space]].  He realizes he is not in a government facility, but is actually on an immense alien [[spacecraft]] numbered 2.3.5.41 (matching the numerical tattoo on his arm) that is about to dock at their home world (signaled by the horn).  A final zoom-out view reveals the whole ship, with a parabolic sun shield on the top and a large alien city, complete with skyscrapers, pointing away from the alien sun. In the distance, another similar city ship can be seen.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Brenton Thwaites]] as Nic Eastman<ref name=\"Laurence\" />\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Dr. Wallace Damon<ref name=\"Laurence\" />\n* [[Olivia Cooke]] as Haley Peterson<ref name=\"abq\" />\n* [[Beau Knapp]] as Jonah Breck\n* [[Lin Shaye]] as Mirabelle<ref name=\"abq\" />\n* Robert Longstreet as James\n* Jeffrey Grover as Gil, Gas Station Clerk <ref>[https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3327021/signal-massive-hit-1990s/ Why \u2018The Signal\u2019 Would Have Been a Massive Hit In the 1990s]</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nThe filmmakers have stated that they wrote the film primarily as an exploration of the conflict between [[reason|logic]] and [[emotion]].

Because let's face it, if you're dealing in science alone, emotions are a waste of time because they just block you down. So that was one of our big questions. We got these kids from MIT. This kid has everything going for him... and then he's struck down with this muscular dystrophy and now his whole life is different. And he's trying to deal with it... only to realize later it's his emotions that make him human, to be who he is.

The so-called \"Signal\" is that [[Interior locution|internal gnawing fire]] of a human's [[Unconscious mind|inner voice]] that can [[Nous|tell what is true]] if listened for, and that [[Human self-reflection|makes humans human]]. Eubank explained the meaning of the film's title by saying the \"Signal\" is a \"waiting for something, listening for something, having an open heart... there's levels of what the 'Signal' really is.\"<ref name=\"rocchi\">{{cite podcast|url=http://www.jamesrocchi.com/2014/06/the-lunch-with-director-william-eubank-of-the-signal/ |title=The Lunch with Director William Eubank of 'The Signal' |website=JamesRocchi.com |publisher=The Lunch Podcast |host=James Rocchi |date=June 20, 2014 |time=38:00 |access-date=June 21, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn the film, the character Nic finally listens and hears \"The Signal\", and in a fiery burst discovers his true feeling, [[love]]. Having found his emotions, Nic chooses to follow a course of action based on love. Eubank discussed this in saying the critical part of the film is \"to watch [Nic] arc out, to decide 'You know what, I\u2019ve been trying to think logically about this the whole time... and [have] always been trying to run away from my emotions, here's a situation that says logically I shouldn't do this or I'm at great risk if I do this, so logically I should do nothing.'

Mr. Eubank plays with our minds, and Nic's, for a while.\" Rapold judges that \"the story evolves into a kind of poor man's ''X-Men'',\" though \"the grandiosity of the film's setups partly fits in with the guys' sense of righteous-geek drama, and you wouldn't be surprised to see Mr. Eubank directing a bigger-budget movie down the road...\"<ref>{{cite news |last= Rapold |first= Nicolas |title= Hackers Take a Road Trip, With a Sci-Fi Detour: ''The Signal'' Features Geeks Wandering Into a Nightmare |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= June 12, 2014 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/13/movies/the-signal-features-geeks-wandering-into-a-nightmare.html |page= C8 |access-date= June 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\nMichael O'Sullivan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' gave the film a one-and-a-half star rating and a half-scathing review: \"Two of the major plot turns in ''The Signal''\u2014a good-looking sci-fi thriller with more fashion sense than brains\u2014hinge on misdirection involving simple arithmetic and spelling. I won't spoil the fun by elaborating further, but when each moment arrives, it's cheapened by the implicit insult to the audience's intelligence. The twists feel less like jolts of genuine surprise than like being had by a third-grader with a good knock-knock joke.\" O'Sullivan adds, \"I'll say one thing: The general state of confusion fostered by the head-scratching plot is a surprisingly effective way of maintaining continued engagement with it\u2014if by 'engagement' you mean 'This better lead somewhere.' Oh, it does. It's just a less than wholly satisfying destination, despite some fun detours. (Veteran character actress [[Lin Shaye|Lin Shay]], in a nutty little cameo, is one such pleasure.)\"<ref>{{cite news |last= O'Sullivan |first= Michael |title= ''The Signal'' movie review |newspaper= [[The Washington Post]] |date= June 12, 2014 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/the-signal-movie-review/2014/06/11/028df584-f18d-11e3-914c-1fbd0614e2d4_story.html |access-date= June 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast, ''[[USA Today]]'' wrote, \"Had Stanley Kubrick and David Lynch made a movie together, it might have looked something like ''The Signal''. Visually stunning, emotionally stunted and weird as all get-out, this sci-fi tale (**1/2 stars out of four, rated PG-13...) isn't worthy of the canon of either master of disturbing imagery. But ''Signal'' thinks big, takes chances and has enough arresting scenes to stand apart from the science fiction films of late... ''Signal'' is so determined to remain mysterious\u2014and pack a visual punch at the movie's climax\u2014that it withholds too much... Instead, ''Signal'' aims to get you thinking.

The less audiences know going in, the more intrigued they'll be by the story's not entirely predictable twists and turns.\" He writes that when \"the film pulls its flashiest twist, which turns Nic into something like the Six Billion Dollar Teen,\" \"it's also the clear highlight of a film more interested in surface flash than in narrative coherence or character depth.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last= Berkshire |first= Geoff |title= Sundance Film Review: ''The Signal'' |journal= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date= January 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== See also==\n* [[Alien abduction]]\n* [[Dark City (1998 film)|''Dark City'' (1998 film)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|2910814|The Signal}}\n* {{AllRovi movie|592485|The Signal}}\n* {{Mojo title|signal2014|The Signal}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=The Signal}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|the_signal_2014|The Signal}}\n* {{YouTube|id=Y-g5vpC-_XQ|title=The Signal}}\n\n{{William Eubank}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Signal, The (2014 film)}}\n[[Category:2014 films]]\n[[Category:2010s science fiction thriller films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction thriller films]]\n[[Category:Techno-thriller films]]\n[[Category:Alien abduction films]]\n[[Category:Films about computing]]\n[[Category:Films about virtual reality]]\n[[Category:Films about disability in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films about couples]]\n[[Category:Films about friendship]]\n[[Category:Entertainment One films]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2015]]\n[[Category:Films set in Nevada]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Ohio]]\n[[Category:Focus Features films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by William Eubank]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]"}]}}}}
