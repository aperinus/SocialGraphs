The original screenplay was written by [[Bruce A. Evans]] and Raynold Gideon, with [[Dean Riesner]] making uncredited re-writes.\n\nThe film received positive reviews but faltered in its initial box office debut.<ref name=\"hollywood reporter\">{{cite web | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/starman-review-1984-movie-953938 | title='Starman': THR's 1984 Review | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Duane | last=Byrge | date=14 December 2016 | accessdate=6 March 2021 | archive-date=16 January 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210116153234/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/starman-review-1984-movie-953938 | url-status=live }}</ref> Bridges was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his role.

The probe is intercepted by an alien planet which then sends a small scout vessel to establish [[first contact (science fiction)|first contact]] with Earth. Instead of greeting the alien craft, the U.S. government shoots it down. Crashing in [[Chequamegon Bay]], [[Wisconsin]], the lone alien occupant, looking like a floating ball of glowing energy, finds the home of recently widowed Jenny Hayden. The alien uses a lock of hair from her deceased husband, Scott, to clone a body for himself as Jenny watches in terror. The alien \"Starman\" has seven small silver spheres with him which provide energy to perform miraculous feats. He uses the first to send a message to his people stating that Earth is hostile and his [[spacecraft]] has been destroyed. He arranges to rendezvous with them in three days' time. He then uses the second sphere to create a holographic map of the United States, coercing Jenny into taking him to the rendezvous in [[Arizona]].\n\nInitially hostile to and frightened of him, Jenny attempts escape. Having a very basic understanding of the English language from the ''Voyager 2'' disk, the Starman learns to communicate with Jenny and assures her that he means no harm. He explains that if he does not reach the rendezvous point, Arizona's [[Meteor Crater|Barringer Crater]], in three days, he will die. Sympathetic but still wary, Jenny teaches him how to drive a car and use [[credit card]]s so he can continue the journey alone. When he resurrects a dead [[deer]], she is deeply moved and decides to stay with him. The authorities pursue the pair across the country. A police officer shoots and critically wounds Jenny. To escape, the Starman crashes their car into a [[Gas carrier|gas tanker]] and uses another sphere to protect them from the explosion. They take refuge in a mobile home that is being towed. He uses another silver sphere to heal Jenny. After being assured that Jenny will recover, he proceeds to hitchhike toward Arizona without her but Jenny manages to catch up to him while he and his driver are stopped at a [[roadblock]]. Reunited, they hitchhike together, resuming their journey towards the crater.\n\nLater, while stowing away on a railroad [[boxcar]], they have sex. The Starman tells Jenny, \"I gave you a baby tonight.\" Jenny explains that she is infertile and cannot have children but he assures her that she is pregnant. He explains that the baby will be the son of her dead husband, because he (Starman) is a clone of Scott. As a child also of Starman, their son will possess all of the Starman's knowledge and will grow up to be a teacher. Starman offers to stop the pregnancy if she wishes but Jenny joyfully embraces him, accepting the gift. They accidentally travel too far on the train and arrive in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Jenny loses her wallet. The Starman uses one of their last [[quarter (United States coin)|quarters]] in a slot machine, which he manipulates to win the $500,000 jackpot. They buy a new car to complete their journey to Arizona.\n\n[[National Security Agency]] director George Fox learns that the Starman's flight trajectory, prior to being shot down, was to the Barringer Crater and arranges to have the Army capture the Starman, dead or alive. [[SETI]] scientist Mark Shermin, another government official involved in the case, criticizes Fox's heavy-handed approach and reminds him that the Starman was invited to Earth. Appalled to learn that Fox is planning to [[vivisection|vivisect]] the alien, Shermin then resolves to help the Starman escape rather than let Fox capture him.\n\nJenny and the slowly dying Starman reach the crater as Army helicopters pursue them. Just as they are surrounded, a large, spherical spaceship appears and descends into the crater. Light surrounds the couple and the Starman is fully healed immediately. As he prepares to leave, he tells Jenny he will never see her again. Jenny asks him to take her with him but he says she would die on his world. He then gives her his last silver sphere, telling her that their son will know what to do with it. Jenny watches as the ship departs.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Scott Hayden / Star Man\n* [[Karen Allen]] as Jenny Hayden\n* [[Charles Martin Smith]] as Mark Shermin\n* [[Richard Jaeckel]] as George Fox\n* [[Robert Phalen]] as Major Bell\n* Tony Edwards as Sergeant Lemon\n* John Walter Davis as Brad Heinmuller\n* [[Ted White (stuntman)|Ted White]] as Deer Hunter\n* [[Dirk Blocker]] as Cop #1\n* [[M.

The original script by [[Bruce A. Evans]] and Raynold Gideon was purchased by the studio at the urging of executive producer [[Michael Douglas]], shortly before it optioned Steven Spielberg's ''Night Skies''. Screenwriter [[Dean Riesner]] came onto the project in late 1981 after director [[Mark Rydell]] left the project due to artistic differences with Douglas. Riesner worked on seven rewrites of ''Starman'' with six different directors, but did not receive screen credit because, according to him, \"the Writers Guild, in their infinite wisdom, decided I didn't contribute 50 percent of the screenplay.\" Other uncredited writers who worked on the script were [[Edward Zwick]] and [[Diane Thomas]]. Columbia abandoned ''Night Skies'', with a similar plot to ''Starman,'' on the grounds that it is a more Disney-like story aimed at children, whereas ''Starman'' was for a more mature audience. ''Night Skies'' was eventually retitled ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'',<ref name=ChicagoTribune>{{cite news|title= 'Starman' stirs up a storm from sci-fi fans and experts|work= [[Chicago Tribune]]|date= January 18, 1985|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-01-18/entertainment/8501040368_1_starman-rewrite-dean-riesner|access-date= 2010-11-18|archive-date= 2011-08-07|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110807121251/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-01-18/entertainment/8501040368_1_starman-rewrite-dean-riesner|url-status= live}}</ref> which became the highest-grossing film of its time,<ref>{{cite web|last=Dirks|first=Tim|title=Top Films of All-Time: Part 1&nbsp;\u2013 Box-Office Blockbusters|publisher=[[Filmsite.org]]|url=http://www.filmsite.org/greatfilmssummary.html|access-date=2012-03-04|archive-date=2013-10-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014123530/http://www.filmsite.org/greatfilmssummary.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial&nbsp;\u2014 Weekend Box Office| publisher = [[Box Office Mojo]]| url = https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&id=et.htm| access-date = 2007-04-18| archive-date = 2013-09-21| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130921144022/http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&id=et.htm| url-status = live}}</ref> upon which Riesner commented, \"Goes to show how wrong you can be in this business.\"\n\nAccording to Riesner, producers at Columbia were concerned at the initial box office returns for ''E.T.'', because ''Starman'' (while Riesner was working its second rewrite) was too similar. [[Adrian Lyne]] had briefly worked on the project before departing to direct ''[[Flashdance]]'' for Paramount. He was replaced by [[John Badham]], who then left to direct ''[[WarGames]]'' as soon as he saw ''E.T.'', and concurred that the two projects were too similar. Riesner was charged with keeping ''Starman'' essentially the same while making it distinct from ''E.T'', and would work with three subsequent directors: [[Tony Scott]], [[Peter Hyams]], and [[John Carpenter]]. Whereas Scott was more interested in style than narrative drive and wanted to cast [[Philip Anglim]], and Hyams pushed for a more conventional science fiction approach, Carpenter, who was eager to shed his image as a maker of exploitative thrillers, wished to emphasize the cross-country rapport that develops between the two leads, as in ''[[The Defiant Ones (film)|The Defiant Ones]]'', ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', and ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' over special effects. Riesner dropped the \"heavy political implications\" from the script to comply with this.<ref name=ChicagoTribune/>\n\nParts of the film were shot in [[Monument Valley, Utah]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n=== Box office ===\n''Starman'' grossed $2.9 million in its opening weekend, debuting at number 6.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=starman.htm |title=Box Office Information for ''Starman'' |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=August 5, 2010 |archive-date=February 11, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211080230/http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=starman.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> It was released the same week as [[David Lynch]]'s film ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]'' and one week after the release of [[Peter Hyams]]'s film ''[[2010 (film)|2010: The Year We Make Contact]]''.
