A [[sequel|follow-up]] to its popular predecessor, ''[[A Better Tomorrow]]'', the film stars returning cast members [[Chow Yun-fat]], [[Ti Lung]] and [[Leslie Cheung]] alongside new cast member [[Dean Shek]]. The film was released in Hong Kong on 17 December 1987.\n\nDue to the popularity of Chow's break-out performance in the previous instalment, he was cast in a new character as the twin brother of \"Mark\", who was killed in the previous film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/screen/Six-Sequels-That-Resurrect-a-Character-or-Actor-Who-Died-in-a-Previous--------------------Installment-42988767.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20141110072022/http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/screen/Six-Sequels-That-Resurrect-a-Character-or-Actor-Who-Died-in-a-Previous--------------------Installment-42988767.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 November 2014|title=Six Sequels That Resurrect a Character or Actor Who Died in a Previous Installment|work=[[Philadelphia Weekly]]}}</ref> ''A Better Tomorrow 2'' is known for its over the top violence, exaggerated blood and gore, and body counts nearing the hundreds.\n\nFilm director John Woo and producer [[Tsui Hark]] had disagreements over the focus of this film. Tsui felt that the film should focus more on Dean Shek's character. This led to the film being edited by both Tsui and Woo. Their disagreements would lead to a split after this film, with Hark directing ''[[A Better Tomorrow 3]]'' and Woo moving on to create ''[[The Killer (1989 film)|The Killer]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=John Woo's Bullet in the Head|last=Williams|first=Tony|publisher=[[Hong Kong University Press]]|year=2009|isbn=9789622099685|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hgoKvQm4QgwC&pg=PA14}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[A Better Tomorrow|Several years after his arrest]], Sung Tse-ho is offered early parole by the police in exchange for spying on his former boss and mentor, Lung Sei, who is suspected of heading a counterfeiting operation. Inspector Wu, the leader of the task force, wants to mark his retirement with the capture of a high profile criminal like Lung.\n\nThough Ho initially declines because of his loyalty to Lung, he eventually changes his mind when he discovers that his younger brother, Kit, who is expecting a child along with his pregnant wife Jackie, is working undercover on the same case. While working the case, the two brothers meet and agree to work together.\n\nAfter being framed for murder, Lung seeks Ho's help, who is able to help him escape to New York. However, Lung suffers a [[psychotic break]] and is institutionalized after receiving news of his daughter's murder and witnessing the death of a friend.\n\nMeanwhile, Ho learns that his deceased friend Mark Lee has a long-lost twin brother, Ken, a former gang member who left Hong Kong as a teenager to travel across America, eventually opening a restaurant in New York City. Ho then locates Ken and enlists his assistance in freeing Lung.\n\nTargeted by both assassins attempting to kill Lung as well as American mobsters looking to extort Ken, Ken and a catatonic Lung take refuge in an apartment building where Ken arms himself. During a shoot-out with their attackers, Ken and Lung find themselves cornered; seeing Ken in trouble snaps Lung out of his stupor, and he kills the last of their pursuers.\n\nThe two return to Hong Kong and regroup with Ho and Kit. The group discovers that one of Lung's employees, Ko Ying-pui, is responsible for attempt on Lung's life and has since taken over the organization in Lung's absence. Lung decides that he would rather destroy his organization with his own hands than let it fall into dishonor and ruin, and the group starts planning to act against Ko.\n\nAfter scouting out Ko's mansion alone, Kit is fatally wounded, but is rescued by Ken, who attempts to rush him to the hospital. Knowing that he will not make it however, Kit persuades Ken to stop at a phone booth to call Jackie, where he manages to name his newborn child Sung Ho-yin (\"the Spirit of Righteousness\") before succumbing to his wounds.\n\nAfter attending Kit's funeral, Ho, Ken, and Lung take revenge on Ko by attacking his mansion during a meeting with a counterfeiting client. The three manage to kill Ko and several of his men following an intense shootout, but are all critically wounded in the process. Following the shootout, the three men sit down in the mansion and are surrounded by the police forces led by Inspector Wu. Upon seeing the condition of the men, Wu orders his men to stand down, while Ho remarks against Inspector Wu's retirement, as there is \"much work left for [him] to do.\"\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Dean Shek]] as Lung Sei\n*[[Chow Yun-fat]] as Ken \"Gor\" Lee\n*[[Ti Lung]] as Sung Tse-ho\n*[[Leslie Cheung]] as Sung Tse-kit\n*[[Emily Chu]] as Jackie Sung (Tse-kit's wife)\n*[[Kwan Shan]] as Ko Ying-pui (The main antagonist)\n*[[Kenneth Tsang]] as Ken (The taxi manager from the first film)\n*[[Shing Fui-On]] as Ko's partner\n*Lam Chung as Ko's partner\n*[[Ng Man-tat]] as Mr Wong (during the early stage of his film career)\n*Peter Wang as Sam (Lung's priest friend in New York)\n*Lung Ming-yan as Chong (Ko's cold blooded hitman)\n*Louis Roth as Protection Money Collector\n*[[Regina Kent]] as Peggy Lung (Lung's daughter)\n*Ken Boyle as New York Counterfeit Buyer\n*Lau Siu-ming as Chief Inspector Wu\n*Mike Abbott as Assassin\n*Cindy Lau as Ken's restaurant staff\n*Steve Mak as Ko's thug\n\n<ref>[http://hkmdb.com/db/movies/view.mhtml?id=6980&display_set=eng A Better Tomorrow 2 at HKMDB]</ref>\n<ref>[http://chinesemov.com/1987/A%20Better%20Tomorrow%20II.html A Better Tomorrow 2 at chinesemov.com]</ref>\n\n==Music==\n===Theme song===\n;\"Will Rush Toward Future Day\" (\u5954\u5411\u672a\u4f86\u65e5\u5b50)\n:*Lyrics: [[Wong Jim]]\n:*Composition and Arrangement: [[Joseph Koo]]\n:*Performance: [[Leslie Cheung]]\n\n===Music cues===\nThis film contains music cues from other films:\n*\"Birdy's Flight (From 'Not One of Us')\"\n**Composer: [[Peter Gabriel]]\n**From: ''[[Birdy (film)|Birdy]]'' (1984)\n*\"Leo Gets It\"\n**Composer: Gary Chang\n**From: ''[[52 Pick-Up]]'' (1987)\n*\"The Set-Up\"\n**Composer: [[Jerry Goldsmith]]\n**From: ''[[Extreme Prejudice (film)|Extreme Prejudice]]'' (1987)\n\n==Release==\nThe film was theatrically released in Hong Kong on 17 December 1987.
