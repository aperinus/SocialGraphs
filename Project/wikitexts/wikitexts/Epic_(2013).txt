Hart]], Daniel Shere, Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember; and directed by [[Chris Wedge]], the director of the animated movies ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'' (2002) and ''[[Robots (2005 film)|Robots]]'' (2005). The film features the voices of [[Colin Farrell]], [[Josh Hutcherson]], [[Amanda Seyfried]], [[Christoph Waltz]], [[Aziz Ansari]], [[Chris O'Dowd]], [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], [[Jason Sudeikis]], [[Steven Tyler]], and [[Beyonc\u00e9|Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles]].\n\nAfter teenager Mary Katherine gets shrunk and teleported to a tiny woodland kingdom inhabited by talking slugs, flower people and tiny soldiers called Leafmen, she is swept up in a wild adventure between good and evil and, alongside her new friends, must fight to protect the world she never knew existed.\n\n''Epic'' was released on May 24, 2013, by [[20th Century Fox]]. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $268 million against its $93 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n\nAfter her mother dies, 17-year-old Mary Katherine, or M.K., moves in with her eccentric [[scientist]] father Professor Bomba, who has spent his life searching for tiny humanoid soldiers called Leafmen in [[Sherman, Connecticut]]. They protect the forest near where Bomba lives from wicked creatures called Boggans and their malevolent leader Mandrake. Bomba\u2019s determination to find proof of his theories irritates his daughter as she believes it\u2019s nonsense, like her mother did, but Bomba assures her he\u2019ll find proof.\n\nMeanwhile, an independent young Leafman named Nod decides to quit, much to the ire of the no-nonsense leader Ronin, who promised Nod\u2019s late father he\u2019d look out for his son.\n\nThe benevolent fairy queen of the forest, Queen Tara, must choose an heir to her throne and goes out to a field of leaf pods on board her flying barge and escorted by the Royal guards, arriving at the field guarded by a laid-back [[slug]] named Mub and a wannabe Leafman [[snail]] named Grub. Immediately after she chooses a pod, the Boggans attack. Tara flees the area with the pod, and though flying Leafmen bodyguards do their best to protect her, they are soon overwhelmed by the sheer number of Boggans. Unable to reach the barge and the safety of the Guards, while being chased, Ronin arrives for her and the pair fly off on his [[hummingbird]] mount. They are then attacked by Mandrake and his son Dagda. Dagda is killed by Ronin, but not until after he shoots Tara.\n\nMeanwhile, M.K. decides to leave after having an argument with Bomba about his research. Before she can leave, Bomba's dog Ozzy runs into the woods. While looking for Ozzy, M.K. sees Tara falling. Dying, Tara gives her the pod and uses her magic to shrink her. She tells M.K. to take the pod to Nim Galuu, a [[glowworm]] wizard, before she dies, and M.K. joins Ronin and the Leafmen, along with Mub and Grub. Ronin discovers that Nod has entered a race against other creatures and bugs on [[bird]]s. Nod goes back on a deal with a short-tempered [[American toad|toad]] [[gangster]] named Bufo to [[Match fixing|throw the race]]. Before Bufo and his two henchmen can feed Nod to a snake, Ronin intervenes and orders them to leave. A reluctant Nod joins him, M.K., Mub, and Grub after hearing about Queen Tara's death, which Bufo overhears.\n\nRonin, Nod, M.K., Mub, and Grub eventually track down Nim Galuu. He then leads them down to the library, where M.K. discovers Tara's brief message before shrinking her, and a message that will get her back to normal size. When Ronin leaves, Nod takes M.K. on a [[deer]] ride and they begin to fall for each other. Meanwhile, Mandrake, grieving over his son's death, has the Boggans bring Bufo to him, finding out the location of the pod. Mandrake goes to Nim Galuu's place to steal the pod, which, if it blooms in darkness, will birth a dark prince who will help Mandrake destroy the forest. He takes the pod and kidnaps Mub and Grub. Ronin scolds Nod for not being there to protect the pod. To get into Boggan territory undiscovered, M.K., Nod, and Ronin set out to Bomba's house to get some disguises, where M.K. learns that the Leafmen have deliberately been leading Bomba off their trail. Bomba sees that he has visitors and captures M.K., fainting when he sees her. M.K. marks the location of Moonhaven on a map Bomba has made of the forest before rejoining Nod and Ronin.\n\nWhen they reach the Boggan land Ronin distracts the Boggans while M.K. and Nod rescue Mub, Grub, and the pod. Mandrake discovers them and orders the Boggans to stop them. M.K., Nod, Mub, and Grub escape alive, but Ronin sacrifices himself to ensure their escape. Before the [[full moon]] can sprout the pod at Moonhaven, Mandrake's [[bat]]s block the light, causing the pod to begin sprouting in darkness. The Leafmen set out to fight the Boggans; M.K. tries to get help from her father by visiting his various cameras he had set in the forest. However, upon regaining consciousness, Bomba believes that he didn't really see M.K. and that he has been insane all these years, and shuts down all his cameras. He changes his mind when he sees the red push-pin that M.K. had put on his map.\n\nBomba is overjoyed to see that he has been right and he follows M.K. to Moonhaven. M.K. uses Bomba\u2019s [[iPod]] to make bat sounds, luring Mandrake's bats away. Meanwhile, Mub and Nim Galuu try to stop Mandrake from reaching the pod, but are unsuccessful. Just then, Ronin appears, bearing scars and bruises from the Boggans. Mandrake manages to outdo him, but is defended by Nod, who finally realizes the importance of teamwork. Before Mandrake can obtain his victory, the pod blooms in moonlight, as Mandrake falls into the burl of a nearby tree.\n\nThe chosen heir is the flower child who helped save Tara earlier in the film. Grub becomes a Leafman, Nod and Ronin reconcile, and Nod and M.K. kiss before M.K. is returned to her original size.\n\nAfter reuniting with Bomba and becoming his assistant, the human family still keep regular contact with their small friends as they continue the research of their world.\n\n==Voice cast==\n*[[Colin Farrell]] as Ronin, a seasoned Leafman warrior, leader of the Leafmen, Nod's guardian and teacher, and a friend of Nod's late father.<ref name=\"Deadline1\">{{cite web |last=Fleming |first=Mike |date=May 31, 2012 |title=Beyonce, Colin Farrell, Josh Hutcherson, Amanda Seyfried, Steven Tyler Lead Voice Cast For Fox Animated Film 'Epic' |url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/05/beyonce-colin-farrell-josh-hutcherson-amanda-seyfried-steven-tyler-lead-voice-cast-for-fox-animated-film-epic |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601215554/http://www.deadline.com/2012/05/beyonce-colin-farrell-josh-hutcherson-amanda-seyfried-steven-tyler-lead-voice-cast-for-fox-animated-film-epic/ |archive-date=June 1, 2012 |access-date=May 31, 2012 |website=Deadline Hollywood}}</ref>\n*[[Josh Hutcherson]] as Nod, a rookie Leafman warrior, Ronin's student, and M.K.'s love interest and boyfriend.<ref name=\"Deadline1\" />\n*[[Amanda Seyfried]] as Mary Katherine \"M.K.\" Bomba, Professor Bomba's 17-year-old daughter.<ref name=\"Deadline1\" /><ref name=\"Philstar\" /> She is named after [[William Joyce (writer)|William Joyce]]'s late daughter.<ref name=\"ASImmersed\">{{cite web |last=Desowitz |first=Bill |date=May 16, 2013 |title=Immersed in Movies: Chris Wedge Gets 'Epic' |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/animationscoop/immersed-in-movies-chris-wedge-gets-epic |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108053642/http://blogs.indiewire.com/animationscoop/immersed-in-movies-chris-wedge-gets-epic |archive-date=November 8, 2014 |access-date=June 18, 2013 |publisher=Animation Scoop}}</ref>\n* [[Christoph Waltz]] as Mandrake, the cruel and snide owner of the Boggans.<ref name=\"USATodaySneak\">{{cite news|last=Wloszczyna|first=Susan|title=Sneak peek: 'Epic' action in a small world|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2012/11/18/epic-animated-movie-chris-wedge-josh-hutcherson/1701189/|access-date=November 21, 2012|newspaper=USA Today|date=November 18, 2012|archive-date=November 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120201957/http://usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2012/11/18/epic-animated-movie-chris-wedge-josh-hutcherson/1701189/|url-status=live}}</ref> Waltz also voiced Mandrake in the German dub of the film since German is his native language.<ref>[http://www.alumniportal-deutschland.org/en/germany/culture/article/christoph-waltz-actor.html] {{dead link|date=November 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Trumbore|first1=Dave|title=EPIC Behind-the-Scenes Preview with Director Chris Wedge Reveals a Battle Between Life and Decay in a Magical Hidden World Right Beneath Our Noses|url=https://collider.com/epic-preview-blue-sky-animation/|publisher=Collider.com|access-date=October 5, 2014|date=March 21, 2013|quote=...Mandrake (Christoph Waltz, who will also be voicing the German version of his character).|archive-date=October 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006144403/http://collider.com/epic-preview-blue-sky-animation/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Aziz Ansari]] as Mub, a [[slug]], Grub's best friend and caretaker of the pods.<ref name=\"Deadline1\" /><ref name=\"USATodaySneak\" />\n* [[Chris O'Dowd]] as Grub, a [[snail]], Mub's best friend and fellow caretaker of the pods.<ref name=\"USATodaySneak\" />\n* [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]] as Bufo, a [[American toad|toad]] who works as a [[Match fixing|race fixer]] and a [[Businessperson|businessman]].<ref name=\"Deadline1\" />\n* [[Jason Sudeikis]] as Professor Radcliffe Bomba,<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Wedge, Chris (Director) | date=May 24, 2013 | title=Epic | medium=Motion picture | location=United States | publisher=20th Century Fox |time=1:37:11}}</ref> M.K.'s father and a [[scientist]].<ref name=\"Deadline1\" /><ref name=\"USATodaySneak\" />\n* [[Steven Tyler]] as Nim Galuu, a [[Glowworm]], a [[showman]] and keeper of magic scrolls that tell what has occurred during the times, in a tree.<ref name=\"Deadline1\" />\n* [[Beyonc\u00e9|Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles]] as Queen Tara, the [[Mother Nature]]-like queen of the forest and Ronin's childhood love.<ref name=\"Deadline1\" />\n* [[Blake Anderson]] as Dagda, Mandrake's son and the Boggan's general officer.

When Pixar tried to close the rights for the film and start development, Fox changed their mind, and the film returned to Fox. The film was officially greenlit in 2009, under the title ''Leaf Men''.<ref name=\"Variety1\" /> In May 2012, Fox announced the final title for the film (''Epic'') 3D-CGI its first cast details, and a plot.<ref name=\"Deadline1\" /> According to Wedge, he was not satisfied with the renaming, which was decided by the marketing department. He also expressed dissatisfaction with subtitles given to the film in some non-English countries, including the French subtitle, ''The Battle of the Secret Kingdom''.<ref>{{cite web|title=(INTERVIEW) A PROPOS D'EPIC AVEC CHRIS WEDGE|url=http://www.focusonanimation.com/interview-propos-depic-chris-wedge-18393/|access-date=October 8, 2013|publisher=Focus on Animation|date=October 8, 2013|author=Nbu|language=fr|archive-date=October 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016201253/http://www.focusonanimation.com/interview-propos-depic-chris-wedge-18393/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the film is based on and borrows many characters from Joyce's book, its plot has been significantly changed. Wedge explained: \"[W]hile Bill wrote a wonderful book, it is a quaint story. We wanted to make a gigantic action-adventure movie.\" To address online speculations about whether the film is similar to other films, like ''[[FernGully: The Last Rainforest]]'' or ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', Wedge said: \"I hate to associate it with other movies. It is adventure on the scale of ''[[Star Wars]]''. And it does immerse the audience completely in a world like ''Avatar''.
