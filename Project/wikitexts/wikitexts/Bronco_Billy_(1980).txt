It was directed by Eastwood and written by Dennis Hackin.\n\n==Plot==\nBronco Billy McCoy (Clint Eastwood) is a stuntman performing in front of a meager crowd in \"Bronco Billy's Wild West Show\", a rundown traveling [[circus]] reminiscent of [[Buffalo Bill's Wild West]], of which he is the owner and operator. For the show's finale, a blindfolded Bronco Billy shoots balloons around a female assistant on a revolving wooden disc, and for the last balloon, he throws a knife. However, his assistant moves her leg and is cut, which spurs her to quit. Due to low ticket sales, Billy has been unable to pay his employees for six months.\n\nThe show moves on to a new town and Bronco Billy goes to [[city hall]] to get a permit. He bumps into Antoinette Lily (Sondra Locke) and John Arlington ([[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]]), who are there to be married. Antoinette despises her future husband, but has to marry before she is thirty in order to inherit a large fortune. Their car breaks down at the motel opposite the Wild West Show. The next morning, Arlington steals all her money and their repaired car. She is left to fend for herself and asks Billy McCoy for help.\n\nBronco Billy talks Antoinette into becoming his new assistant, \"Miss Lily,\" though she only agrees to do one show. Her first performance is unusually successful, although Miss Lily irritates Billy by not sticking to the script.\n\nAntoinette discovers that Arlington has been arrested for her murder (framed by Antoinette's stepmother and her scheming lawyer friend, who stand to gain her inheritance). Seizing the chance to get even with Arlington, Antoinette rejoins the Wild West Show.\n\nAntoinette learns that none of Billy's performers are actually [[cowboy]]s. Billy's crew are largely ex-[[convict]]s, [[alcoholic]]s, or both. Bronco Billy was a shoe salesman from New Jersey who shot his wife for sleeping with his best friend. Nevertheless, Miss Lily begins to warm to the troupe.\n\nTwo of the show's performers announce that they are going to have a baby. The crew goes to a bar to celebrate. One gets arrested by police who discover that he is a [[deserter]] from the [[US Army|Army]]. Bronco Billy uses the show's meager savings to bribe the sheriff into letting the man go, swallowing his pride and enduring the sheriff's verbal humiliations for his friend's sake.\n\nOne night the circus tent burns down. Everyone blames Miss Lily for their bad luck, but Bronco Billy defends her and proposes that they rob a train. They try to do this in the standard Western way (riding alongside and jumping on), but a modern train proves to be resistant to such an approach and they give up.\n\nNext, the troupe travels to a [[mental institution]] at which they have previously performed ''[[pro bono]]''. The head of the institution, who is obsessed with the Wild West, agrees to provide them with accommodation and to supply a new tent, with the [[Incarceration|inmate]]s helping to sew one out of [[American flag]]s. Miss Lily and Bronco Billy spend the night together. By chance, one inmate turns out to be Arlington (who had been paid by a crooked lawyer to confess to being mentally disturbed when he \"murdered\" Antoinette). When he sees her, he raises a fuss and gets released. Bronco Billy and the show depart without Miss Lily.\n\nAntoinette returns to her luxurious lifestyle, but she is bored and misses Billy, who drowns his loneliness with alcohol. When Bronco Billy is about to introduce Lefty as his assistant, Miss Lily appears. The show, now a raving success, runs smoothly and Bronco Billy ends it with a positive message for the children in the audience.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Billy \"Bronco Billy\" McCoy\n* [[Sondra Locke]] as Antoinette Lily\n* [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]] as John Arlington\n* [[Scatman Crothers]] as \"Doc\" Lynch\n* [[Bill McKinney]] as \"Lefty\" LeBow\n* [[Sam Bottoms]] as Leonard James\n* [[Dan Vadis]] as Chief Big Eagle\n* Sierra Pecheur as Lorraine Running Water\n* [[Walt Barnes|Walter Barnes]] as Sheriff Dix\n* [[Woodrow Parfrey]] as Dr. Canterbury\n* [[Beverlee McKinsey]] as Irene Lily\n* [[Doug McGrath]] as Lieutenant Wiecker\n* [[Hank Worden]] as Station Mechanic\n* Tessa Richarde as Miss Mitzy\n* [[William Prince (actor)|William Prince]] as Edgar Lipton\n\n==Production==\nEastwood received [[Dennis E.
