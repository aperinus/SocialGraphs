The film stars [[Sean Maguire]], [[Carmen Electra]] and [[Kevin Sorbo]].\n\n''Meet the Spartans'' opened at {{abbr|No.|Number}}&nbsp;1 in the United States. Despite receiving extremely negative reviews and appearing on several [[List of films considered the worst#Meet the Spartans (2008)|lists of the worst films ever made]], it was a box-office success, grossing $84 million on a budget of $30 million.<ref name=\"mojo\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Gerousia|A Spartan elder]] [[Sparta#Birth and death|inspects three babies]]. The first, an ugly, talking baby ogre (''[[Shrek the Third]]''), is abandoned to die for its deformity; while [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Angelina Jolie]] adopt the second, who is Vietnamese. The third, [[Leonidas I|Leonidas]], is accepted as a Spartan for his already-present muscular physique and is prepared for kinghood through brutal training. An adult Leonidas is cast out into the wild, survives the harsh winter, and hunts down a [[Gangsta rap|gangsta]] [[penguin]] (''[[Happy Feet]]''). Returning a king for his inauguration wearing a penguin skin hat, Leonidas sees [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Margo]] erotically dancing and asks her to marry him, to which she responds by giving him the combination to her armor-plated [[chastity belt]].\n\nYears later, Leonidas is [[Child abuse|training]] his son when Captain informs him that a Persian messenger has arrived. Accompanied by the Spartan politician Traitoro, the messenger presents Persian King [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]' demands for Sparta's submission. After growing angry with both the messenger's disrespect and finding him making out with his wife, Leonidas kicks him into a pit. Despite Traitoro's advice that the messenger's guards are now needed to convey the actual message, Leonidas kicks them in as well, along with [[Britney Spears]] and [[Kevin Federline]], [[Sanjaya Malakar]], [[Ryan Seacrest]], and the [[American Idol]] [[Simon Cowell|ju]][[Randy Jackson|dg]][[Paula Abdul|es]]. Resolving to face the [[Persia]]ns, Leonidas visits the prophets and gives them medicines such as [[Neutrogena]] as their price for their consultation. They advise him that he should consult the [[Oracle]] for any advice. The Oracle [[Ugly Betty]] reveals that Leonidas will die should he go to war.\n\nAfter deciding while spending the night with his wife, Leonidas meets the soldiers assembled for his departure to [[Thermopylae]], and finds that only thirteen were accepted in the army due to stringent requirements. Among them are Captain, his son Sonio, and a slightly unfit Spartan named Dilio. Once at the Hot Gates, they encounter a deformed [[Paris Hilton]], who tells Leonidas and the Captain about a secret goat path above the Hot Gates that Xerxes could use to outflank the Spartans. When she asks to be made a Spartan soldier, Leonidas rejects her as unqualified because she cannot use a spear correctly. Leonidas and his platoon soon face off with Xerxes' messenger and his Immortals, beating them in a [[Stomp the Yard|dance contest]] before driving them off a cliff. Xerxes, impressed, personally approaches Leonidas and attempts to [[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|bribe him]] with a trip to the [[Palms Hotel and Casino]]. Leonidas declines, and the Spartans face the [[Persia]]n army in a \"[[Mother insult|Yo Momma]]\" fight, which the Spartans win, but Dilio has his eyes scratched out and wanders away.\n\nDeciding to betray the Spartans, Hilton tells Xerxes where the goat path is in return for various gifts and for having her deformed hump removed. Xerxes meets the twelve remaining Spartans and the war begins. Meanwhile, back in Sparta, Queen Margo has several confrontations with Traitoro, as he is the vital vote in sending more troops to assist her husband. Following her address to the council, Traitoro publicly betrays the Queen, who then battles him in a parody of ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' and defeats him using a [[Black & Decker DustBuster|dust buster]]. With Traitoro's deceit exposed, the council is united with the queen.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], the Persians introduce their secret weapons, [[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|Ghost Rider]] and [[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]], who kills Sonio with a decapitating uppercut. Captain avenges him with Botox poisoning before being struck down by Xerxes. Leonidas pursues Xerxes and plays ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]''. Managing to find the \"Transformer Cube\", Xerxes uses it in a car to become [[Megatron|Xerxestron]] and shows off his powers to access the \"[[Chris Crocker#\"Leave Britney Alone!\"|Leave Britney Alone!]]\" video on [[YouTube]]. However, Xerxestron accidentally trips on his extension cord and falls on Leonidas and the surviving Spartans, killing them. The blind Dilio eventually returns to Sparta to inform Queen Margo of Leonidas's death. A year later, Dilio leads a larger Spartan force to defeat the Persians, but the blind warrior ends up going the wrong way. They end up in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], where they knock [[Lindsay Lohan]] down as she is leaving [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]] again.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sean Maguire]] as [[Leonidas I|King Leonidas]]\n** [[Zachary Dylan Smith]] as young Leonidas\n* [[Kevin Sorbo]] as Captain\n* [[Carmen Electra]] as [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Queen Margo]]\n* [[Ken Davitian]] as [[Xerxes I|King Xerxes]]\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Councilman Traitoro\n* [[Travis Van Winkle]] as Sonio\n* [[Jareb Dauplaise]] as [[Aristodemus of Sparta|Dilio]]\n* [[Nicole Parker]] as [[Paris Hilton]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]], [[Paula Abdul]]\n* [[Ike Barinholtz]] as [[Le Chiffre]], Prophet, [[Dane Cook]]\n* Hunter Clary as [[Pleistarchus|Leo Jr.]]\n* [[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]] as Messenger\n* [[Method Man]] as Persian Emissary\n* Andy Basargian as [[Brad Pitt]]\n* Tiffany Claus as [[Angelina Jolie]]\n* [[Nick Steele (actor)|Nick Steele]] as [[Kevin Federline]]\n* [[Tony Yalda]] as [[Sanjaya Malakar]]\n* Christopher Lett as [[Randy Jackson]]\n* [[Jim Piddock]] as Loyalist, [[Simon Cowell]]\n* [[Nate Haden]] as [[Ryan Seacrest]]\n* [[Crista Flanagan]] as Oracle/[[Betty Suarez|Ugly Betty]], Spartan Woman\n* [[Robin Atkin Downes]] (''uncredited'') as Narrator\n* Thomas McKenna as [[Tom Cruise]]\n* Jesse Lewis IV as Ms. Jay Alexander\n* Jenny Costa as [[Tyra Banks]]\n* Belinda Waymouth as [[Twiggy]]\n* [[Dean Cochran]] as [[Rocky Balboa]], [[John Rambo|Rambo]]\n* [[Emily Wilson (actress)|Emily Wilson]] as [[Lindsay Lohan]]\n* [[John Di Domenico]] as [[Donald Trump]]\n* Jim Nieb as [[George W.
