It is produced by [[K/O Paper Products|Kurtzman/Orci Productions]], [[Mandeville Films]] and [[Touchstone Pictures]] for [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], and stars [[Sandra Bullock]] and [[Ryan Reynolds]] with [[Malin \u00c5kerman]], [[Craig T. Nelson]], [[Mary Steenburgen]] and [[Betty White]] in supporting roles. The plot centers on a Canadian executive who learns that she may face [[deportation]] from the U.S. because her [[travel visa|visa]] renewal application was denied. Determined to retain her position as [[editor-in-chief]] of a publishing house, she convinces her assistant to temporarily act as her fianc\u00e9.\n\nDevelopment began in 2005, when Chiarelli wrote the script. Principal filming occurred over a period of two months from March to May 2008. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who criticized its screenplay but praised the chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds. It was a box office success, grossing over $317 million worldwide on its $40 million budget. Bullock was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]].\n\n==Plot==\nMargaret Tate is a Canadian executive editor-in-chief of a New York book publishing company. Due to her pushy personality, she is disliked by her employees. Margaret learns from her superior Chairman Bergen that her visa renewal application has been denied due to visa term violation and she faces deportation back to Canada. Not wanting to lose her position and life in New York, she blackmails her much abused assistant Andrew Paxton into marrying her so she can get a [[green card]]. She reminds Andrew that if she is deported, the work he put in as her assistant will be lost, which will set back his dream to become an editor.\n\nU.S. [[immigration consultant|immigration agent]] Gilbertson informs them that he suspects they are committing fraud to avoid Margaret's deportation. Gilbertson tells them that they will be asked questions about each other separately. If their answers do not match, Margaret will be deported to Canada permanently and Andrew will be convicted of a [[felony]] punishable by a $250,000 fine and five years in prison. Andrew insists that Margaret make him an editor after their marriage and publish the book he has been recommending to her. Margaret is forced to agree.\n\nThe couple travels to [[Sitka, Alaska]], Andrew's hometown, to meet his family. Margaret meets Andrew's mother Grace and grandmother Annie, known as \"Gammy\". During the trip to the family home, Margaret notices that nearly every shop in town carries the name Paxton and learns that Andrew's family is in fact very wealthy. During a welcome home party, Andrew confronts his father Joe, who is angry about Andrew dating the boss he has so long disliked and believes he is using her to get ahead in his career. After their argument, Andrew announces the engagement to everyone. Margaret also meets Gertrude, Andrew's ex-girlfriend. At the party, they invent the story of how Andrew proposed to Margaret.\n\nThe next day, Grace and Annie take Margaret to a local bar as part of her bachelorette party to watch a strip dance by locally famous but over-the-hill exotic dancer Ramone. Stepping away from the show, Margaret learns from Gertrude that Andrew wanted to become an editor and make his own life and that Andrew had proposed to Gertrude. However, Gertrude refused because she did not want to leave Sitka for New York. Margaret also learns of the conflict between Andrew and Joe. That night, Margaret asks Andrew about his relationship with his father, but Andrew refuses to talk. Instead, Margaret opens up to him.\n\nThe next day, the family convinces them to marry while they're in Sitka. Margaret realizes how close and real Andrew's family is, and this moves her deeply especially because of the deception. She gets on Andrew's boat, and speeds away with him. She admits she has been alone since she was sixteen years old after her parents died, and had forgotten what it felt like to have a family. She lets go of the helm and stumbles to the back of the boat. Andrew makes a sharp turn to avoid hitting a buoy and Margaret falls out of the boat. Andrew quickly turns the boat around and saves her because she cannot swim. Meanwhile, suspicious Gilbertson has turned up in Sitka ready to charge Andrew with fraud. At the wedding, Margaret stops the ceremony by confessing the truth to the guests and Gilbertson. Gilbertson informs her she has 24 hours to leave for Canada.\n\nMargaret returns to the Paxton home to pack her things. Andrew rushes to their room only to find Margaret has already left, leaving his book manuscript with a note of praise and a promise to publish it. Gertrude attempts to comfort Andrew and asks if he is going to go after her. As he rushes out to find Margaret, another argument arises between him and Joe. Annie suddenly shows symptoms of a heart attack, causing her and the family to be airlifted to the hospital and convinces them to reconcile before she \"passes away\". After she succeeds in getting things moving again, she admits to faking the heart attack as it was the only means to get their attention, and tells the pilot to head to the airport in hopes of catching up to Margaret.\n\nAndrew's parents realize he really loves Margaret. He returns to New York and tells Margaret he loves her in front of the entire office staff. After they kiss, they go to Gilbertson and inform him that they are again engaged but for real this time. Gilbertson questions Andrew\u2019s family and friends which proves it.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Margaret Tate, a pushy editor-in-chief at a major New York City book publisher. \n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Andrew Paxton, Margaret's assistant whose ultimate career goal is to become an editor.\n* [[Malin \u00c5kerman]] as Gertrude, Andrew's ex-girlfriend.\n* [[Craig T.
