Soon, Anna meets and falls in love with Leo (Neeson), an Irish sculptor who helps her to find true passion and fulfillment. He is a nice guy, and has a stable relationship with Anna. Molly is soon exposed to their sexual relationship. One day, Molly sees Leo naked in the bathroom. She points at his private part and asks what it is. He tells her and she asks if she can touch it. He says okay and she puts her little hand on it for a second. However, children being children, Molly talks to Brian about her experience with Leo. Brian accused Leo of sexually molesting Molly and sues Anna for custody of their daughter. Then, Leo starts facing charges of child molestation, and Anna learns that she may lose custody of Molly to Brian. Leo finally clears himself out after explaining the mistake, that he thought it was in keeping with Anna's parenting, since she had bathed with Molly and was very open with her. A counselor agrees that Leo should have known better but he believes that Molly hasn't been abused and is a very well adjusted and happy child, particularly with Anna and Leo. In the end the judge gives custody to Brian and Anna's relationship with Leo ends. She does not fight for her child although an appeal was an option. She only sees Molly on alternate weekends and holidays. One of her loves was taken away and the other she pushed away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as Anna Dunlop\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as Leo Cutter\n* [[Jason Robards]] as W. O.
