It is based on the [[The Great Santini (novel)|1976 novel of the same name]] by [[Pat Conroy]]. The film stars [[Robert Duvall]], [[Blythe Danner]], and [[Michael O'Keefe]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nA [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] officer whose success as an [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantom]] military aviator contrasts with his shortcomings as a husband and father. The film, set in 1962, before widespread American involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], explores the high price of heroism and self-sacrifice.\n\n==Plot==\nA warrior without a war, Lt. Col. Wilbur \"Bull\" Meechum, a pilot also known as \"the Great Santini\" to his fellow Marines, moves his family to the military base town of [[Beaufort, South Carolina]], in peacetime 1962. His wife Lillian is loyal and docile, tolerant of Meechum's temper and drinking. Their teenaged children, Ben and Mary Anne, are accustomed to his stern discipline and behave accordingly, while adapting to their new town and school.\n\nBen's talent at basketball earns him a spot on the school team, and he becomes a dominant player on the court. During one-on-one games with Meechum at home, though, Meechum refuses to let Ben win, using unnecessarily rough physical tactics and humiliating insults and berating the rest of the family when they try to interfere. When Ben finally wins a game, Meechum unleashes a torrent of verbal abuse while bouncing the ball off his head. Later that night, Ben finds Meechum practicing basketball alone in the driveway; Lillian urges Ben not to be angry at him and explains that he is proud of Ben but struggling with a loss of control over things he used to master so easily. During a school game, Meechum orders Ben to strike back against a rival player who has committed a foul on him. Ben tackles the player and breaks his arm, getting himself ejected from the game and dismissed from the team.\n\nBen befriends a young black man, Toomer Smalls, who is being harassed by bully Red Pettus. Toomer uses a beehive to get revenge on Red, but Red accidentally shoots him. Ignoring Meechum's orders, Ben leaves the house to help Toomer, but he arrives too late and Toomer dies. Meechum is angry for Ben's disobedience, but another Marine tells him that Ben showed courage by choosing to help his friend.\n\nStill unable or unwilling to appreciate Ben's sensitive nature, Meechum accepts one last aerial mission from which he does not return. His engines failing, he chooses to crash his plane into the sea rather than ejecting and letting the aircraft crash into a nearby town. The family leaves Beaufort after his funeral. Ben assumes Meechum's role as the leader of the household, as Bull had intended.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast: first four per tombstone opening credits order, remaining per closing \"Co-Starring\" order, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{castlist|\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Lieutenant Colonel Wilbur \"Bull\" P.

Carlino also directed the film. The title character, Lt. Col. Wilbur \"Bull\" Meechum, aka \"The Great Santini\", was based on Conroy's father.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skygod.com/quotes/greatsantini.html |title=Colonel Don Conroy's Eulogy| first= Pat |last= Conroy|date=May 1998|access-date=14 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=santini|title=His Winning Season| first= Wright |last= Thompson|publisher= ESPN |access-date=14 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citadel.edu/root/conroy|title=I wear the ring |first= Pat |last= Conroy |year= 2001 |work= Commencement Speech, Class of 2001| place= [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]], Charleston, South Carolina| access-date=14 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe story, for the most part, follows the book. The movie's major divergence is the absence of Ben Meechum's Jewish best friend Sammy. The spelling of the family's surname was also changed from Meecham to Meechum. Also changed is Meechum's aircraft; in the book, he flies and commands a squadron of [[F-8 Crusader]]s, while in the film the fighters shown are [[F-4 Phantom II]]s.\n\nMuch of the film was shot on location in [[Beaufort, South Carolina]]. Tidalholm, the 19th-century house used for the Meechum residence, later was used in ''[[The Big Chill (film)|The Big Chill]]'' (1983).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/search/title?locations=Tidalholm%20Mansion%20-%201%20Laurens%20Street,%20Beaufort,%20South%20Carolina,%20USA&ref_=ttloc_loc_1|title=Most Popular Titles With Location Matching 'Tidalholm Mansion \u2013 1 Laurens Street, Beaufort, South Carolina, USA'|work=imdb.com|access-date=December 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot in a 1.85:1 [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] but was only produced in that ratio in the LaserDisc format. Both the VHS and DVD releases are in 1.33:1, also known as [[4:3|full screen]] or [[pan & scan]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} To date the film has not had a release in the Blu-ray format.\n\n===Herman Raucher misattribution===\n[[Herman Raucher]] is often credited as a ghostwriter for the feature film.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0712029/ | title= Herman Raucher| website= IMDB.com| publisher= Internet Movie Database}}</ref> However, Raucher did no work on the film; the misconception arises from the fact that, in the 1980s, Raucher was hired to write a television pilot based on the movie; he only wrote \"a couple of pieces,\" he explained.<ref name= Redisc>{{cite web| url= http://www.cinedump.com/interviews/2016/9/13/hermanraucher |interviewer= Preston Fassel| title= Rediscovering Herman Raucher| first= Herman | last= Raucher| author-link= Herman Raucher| website= Cinedump.com| date= 13 September 2016|access-date= 30 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nRaucher has stated that, into the 2000s, he continued to receive fan mail for ''Santini'' and that the volume of letters he received was surpassed only by those for ''[[Summer of '42]]''.<ref name= Redisc />\n\n==Release==\n[[Warner Bros.]] executives were concerned that the film's plot and lack of bankable actors would make it difficult to market. It made its world premiere in Beaufort in August 1979 and was soon released in North Carolina and South Carolina to empty cinemas. Believing the film's title, which implied it was about circus stunts, was the problem, it was tested with other titles: as ''Sons and Heroes'' in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], as ''Reaching Out'' in [[Rockford, Illinois]], and ''The Ace'' in [[Peoria, Illinois]]. As it tested better in Peoria, ''The Ace'' stuck. Even with its new title, the film performed poorly. [[Orion Pictures]] pulled the film and sold cable rights to [[HBO]] along with the airline rights to recoup its losses.<ref name=\"tini\" />\n\nProducer Charles A. Pratt still had faith in the film and raised enough money (some from Orion) to release ''The Great Santini'' in New York City under its original title. It received positive reviews, and business was steady. Two weeks later, it debuted on HBO, and audiences stopped coming. Orion executive [[Mike Medavoy]] blamed the film's box-office failure to a lack of a traditional release: screening it first in New York and expanding markets due to word-of-mouth.<ref name=\"tini\">{{cite book| last1= Medavoy| first1= Mike |author-link1=Mike Medavoy | last2= Young| first2= Josh |year= 2002| title= You're Only as Good as Your Next One: 100 Great Films, 100 Good Films, and 100 for Which I Should Be Shot| pages= 105\u2013107| place= [[New York City]]| publisher= [[Atria Books]]}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film was well received by critics.
