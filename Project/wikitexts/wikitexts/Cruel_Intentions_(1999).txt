Kathryn promises Mrs. Caldwell that she will look out for the na\u00efve Cecile. When Kathryn's stepbrother Sebastian Valmont enters the room, Mrs. Caldwell reacts to him coldly and leaves with Cecile.\n\nKathryn tells Sebastian that she intends to use Cecile to take revenge on her ex-lover Court Reynolds, who dumped her for Cecile. Kathryn enlists Sebastian, a notorious womanizer, to seduce Cecile, thereby spoiling her in Court's eyes. Sebastian refuses because he is planning to seduce Annette Hargrove, the headmaster's virgin daughter, who has published an essay in support of chastity until marriage. After some negotiation, they agree on a wager: if Sebastian fails to seduce Annette, Kathryn gets Sebastian's vintage [[Jaguar XK140]]; if he succeeds, Kathryn will have sex with him.\n\nSebastian's first attempt to seduce Annette fails, as she is apparently already aware of his reputation. Sebastian initially suspects Greg, Annette\u2019s friend from Kansas who is a popular football player and closeted homosexual. Sebastian convinces Greg to put in a good word about him to Annette, blackmailing him with a photo of him and another gay student in bed. Sebastian also finds out that Mrs. Caldwell was the one who warned Annette about Sebastian. Sebastian finally agrees to corrupt Cecile as revenge. Meanwhile, Cecile confides in Kathryn about her romance with her older music teacher, Ronald Clifford. Kathryn reveals this to Mrs. Caldwell, who orders Cecile to end the relationship, but only because Ronald is black. Sebastian lures Cecile to his house by claiming he has a letter to her from Ronald. He then gets Cecile drunk and blackmails her into allowing him to perform oral sex on her. The next day, Cecile confides in Kathryn, who advises her to be as promiscuous as possible to learn how to please Ronald.\n\nSebastian begins to truly fall in love with Annette, who returns his feelings but is still hesitant. Sebastian calls her a hypocrite for resisting the chance for true love despite claiming that she was waiting for it. Annette finally relents, but Sebastian, confused about his own feelings, now refuses her. Annette flees to the estate of her friend's parents. Sebastian finds her and professes his feelings, and they make love.\n\nKathryn offers herself to Sebastian after he wins the 'bet', but he rejects her, now only wanting Annette. Sebastian informs Kathryn that he was planning to tell Annette the truth, but a jealous and enraged Kathryn warns him that doing so will destroy both his and Annette's reputations. Sebastian lies to Annette, claiming that she was just a conquest and that he has no real feelings for her. Devastated, Annette tells him to leave. Sebastian informs Kathryn that he has broken up with Annette and now wants his reward for winning the bet. Kathryn reveals that he, not Annette, was the true target of her scheme and that she manipulated him into abandoning Annette for her own amusement. She then dismisses him, telling him that she doesn't sleep with \"losers\".\n\nSebastian tries to contact Annette to confess the truth and beg for a second chance, but she refuses to see him. He gives her his journal, in which he has detailed Kathryn's manipulative schemes, their bet, and his true feelings for Annette. Seeking revenge, Kathryn calls Ronald, claiming that Sebastian hit her and slept with Cecile. Ronald violently confronts Sebastian, and the ensuing fight migrates to the middle of the street. Annette tries to intervene but is thrown into traffic. Sebastian pushes her to safety but ends up getting hit by a taxi. Sebastian and Annette confess their love for each other before he dies. Ronald witnesses this and leaves angry once he finds out from Annette that Kathryn used him.\n\nAt Sebastian's funeral, Kathryn delivers a eulogy, which people start leaving midway through. Kathryn rushes outside to find Cecile handing out copies of Sebastian's journal. As the details of her manipulations and drug abuse are made public, Kathryn's reputation is finally destroyed. Feeling guilt over his role in causing Sebastian's death, Ronald writes a detailed confession of how she lied to him about Cecile not being a virgin and her claims about Sebastian hitting her in order to have him killed. It is implied that the disapproving headmaster will expel her from the school, especially after finding cocaine hidden in the cross of her rosary, and likely she will be arrested for the murder of Sebastian. In the final scene, Annette drives away in Sebastian's car with his journal at her side, recalling their fondest moments together.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as [[Kathryn Merteuil]], based on the Marquise de Merteuil\n* [[Ryan Phillippe]] as Sebastian Valmont, based on the Vicomte de Valmont\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Annette Hargrove, based on Madame de Tourvel\n* [[Selma Blair]] as Cecile Caldwell, based on C\u00e9cile Volanges\n* [[Louise Fletcher]] as Helen Rosemond, based on Madame de Rosemonde\n* [[Joshua Jackson]] as Blaine Tuttle\n* [[Eric Mabius]] as Greg McConnell\n* [[Sean Patrick Thomas]] as Ronald Clifford, based on the Chevalier Danceny\n* [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as Dr. Regina Greenbaum (Kurtz notably portrayed Madame de Volanges in the 1988 film version of ''[[Dangerous Liaisons]]'')\n* [[Christine Baranski]] as Bunny Caldwell, based on Madame de Volanges\n* [[Alaina Reed Hall]] as Nurse\n* [[Deborah Offner]] as Mrs. Michalak\n* [[Tara Reid]] as Marci Greenbaum\n* [[Hiep Thi Le]] as Mai-Lee\n* [[Herta Ware]] as Mrs. Sugarman\n* [[Drew Snyder]] as Headmaster Hargrove\n* [[Charlie O'Connell]] as Court Reynolds, based on the Comte de Gercourt\n* [[Fred Norris]] as Meter Maid\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Old Westbury Gardens 10.JPG|thumb|Old Westbury Gardens was one of the filming locations.]]\nOne of the filming locations was [[Old Westbury Gardens]] in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]], New York, as well as the [[Harry F.
