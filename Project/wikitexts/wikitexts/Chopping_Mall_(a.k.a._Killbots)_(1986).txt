It focuses on three high-tech security [[robot]]s turning maniacal and killing teenage employees inside a shopping mall after dark.\n\nThe film was test-screened under the title ''Killbots'' by its distributor, [[New Concorde|Concorde Pictures]]. After it performed poorly with test audiences, the film was re-titled ''Chopping Mall'', and approximately 19 minutes were excised.\n\nIn the years since its release, ''Chopping Mall'' has gone on to develop a [[cult following]], and been subject to [[film criticism]] for its perceived themes of [[consumerism|human consumption]] and excess during the [[Reagan Era]] in the United States.\n\n==Plot==\nPark Plaza Mall has just installed a state-of-the-art security system, including shutters across all exits and three high-tech [[robot]]s programmed to disable and apprehend thieves using tasers and tranquilizer guns. Allison and Suzie, co-workers at a pizzeria in the mall, join their respective boyfriends, Greg and Ferdy\u2014along with their other friends, couples Rick and Linda, and Mike and Leslie\u2014for an after-hours party in a furniture store where Mike, Greg, and Ferdy work. Once the mall closes for the night, the couples begin to have sex, drink, and party inside the furniture store.\n\nOutside, a lightning storm strikes the mall several times and damages the computer controlling Protectors 1, 2 and 3, which malfunction and kill the technicians and a janitor before starting their routine patrol. When Mike goes to purchase [[cigarettes]] for Leslie at a vending machine, Protector 1 attacks him and slashes his throat. Leslie goes to find him, she is chased by Protector 1, which beams a laser at her, causing her head to explode. The others witness Leslie's murder, and barricade themselves in a stock room. The women attempt to escape through an air vent, but Suzie panics and they exit the vent system into an automotive shop, arming themselves with gasoline and flares. Meanwhile, the men break into a sporting-goods store to arm themselves with firearms. Reunited, the group use a propane tank to seemingly destroy Protector 1. While the men set up the elevator as a booby trap, the killbots ambush the women and ignite Suzie by shooting her gasoline can, burning her alive. Greg unsuccessfully shoots them before Rick drags him away.\n\nThe teenagers regroup and rig the elevator trap on Protector 2, destroying it. They then hide in the restaurant where Allison works. Inside, Greg confronts Allison and Linda about leaving the air ducts and exhibits rage due to Suzie's death, pulling his gun on Ferdy when he intercedes on Allison and Linda's behalf. Rick tries to calm him down, and Ferdy suggests destroying the killbots' main control center in hopes of shutting them all down. The group agrees and heads to the control center on the third floor. The robot throws Greg over the railing and he falls to his death.\n\nOn the run, the four remaining survivors, Allison, Ferdy, Rick, and Linda also find the first robot recovered after its earlier defeat. They take refuge inside a department store and set up mannequins to confuse Protector 1 and Protector 3. Their plan works as they fire at the dummies and one of them blinds itself with its own reflected laser. However, the blind Protector 3 kills Linda and an enraged Rick rams a golf cart into it. A bolt of electricity kills him, but his attempts successfully destroy the robot.\n\nProtector 1 is marked as the final robot cornering Allison, Ferdy rescues her and shoots it point-blank, damaging its laser just before he falls unconscious. Despite an injured leg, Allison escapes into Ellis Paint Company and sets up a trap by mixing paint and chemicals. She lures Protector 1 inside, where it gets stuck for failing to find traction on the spilled paint and thinners. She tosses a flare into the store, igniting the chemicals and finally destroys Protector 1. As daylight appears, Allison leaves the store and Ferdy awakens. The two remain the only survivors.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, a fourth, unknown Protector says its catchphrase \"Have a nice day\" one last time.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Kelli Maroney]] as Allison Parks\n* [[Tony O'Dell]] as Ferdy Meisel\n* [[Russell Todd]] as Rick Stanton\n* Karrie Emerson as Linda Stanton\n* [[Barbara Crampton]] as Suzie Lynn\n* Nick Segal as Greg Williams\n* [[Suzee Slater]] as Leslie Todd\n* [[John Terlesky]] as Mike Brennan\n* [[Paul Bartel]] as Paul Bland\n* [[Mary Woronov]] as Mary Bland\n* [[Angela Aames]] as Miss Vanders\n* [[Dick Miller]] as Walter Paisley\n* Paul Coufos as Dr. Stan Simon\n* Arthur Roberts as Mr. Todd \n* [[Gerrit Graham]] as Nessler, The Technician\n* [[Angus Scrimm|Lawrence Guy]] as Dr. Carrington\n* Toni Naples as Lead Bathing Beauty\n* [[Mel Welles]] as Cook\n* [[Jim Wynorski]] as Killbots (voice)\n* [[Rodney Eastman]] as Shoplifter (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Analysis==\nFilm scholar Craig Ian Mann compares the film favorably to [[George A.

We both very much wanted to make him happy.\"<ref name=\"steve\"/> He says, \"the specter of Roger loomed large for the first couple of days\", but after the second or third night, Corman said they were doing a \"very fine job\". \"So there was a collective sigh of relief on our part that we were making Roger happy, and that\u2019s what really mattered,\" says Mitchell.<ref name=\"steve\"/>\n\nWynorski says that Bartel and Woronov ad-libbed the bulk of their parts.<ref name=\"gore\"/>\n\nMitchell estimates [[Principal photography|filming]] took 20 days at the Galleria and two days at Corman's studios.<ref name=\"steve\"/>\n\n==Release==\n[[New Concorde|Concorde Pictures]] gave the film a regional [[test market]] release under the title ''Killbots'' on March 21, 1986.<ref name=afi>{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/57584|work=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]]|title=Chopping Mall|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|access-date=August 20, 2022}} {{small|Note: Toggle between \"History\", \"Details\", and other tabs for full scope of source.}}</ref> After it fared poorly with audiences, the film was truncated and re-titled ''Chopping Mall'', under which it was theatrically released in [[Pittsburgh]] on September 5, 1986, and in New York City on November 14, 1986.<ref name=afi/>\n\n===Alternative versions===\nAt least two different versions of the film exist. The TV cut has some extra footage, such as a small homage to ''[[Attack of the Crab Monsters]]'', extended scenes of Ferdy and Allison watching TV, some aerial shots, and an extension of one of the Ferdy/Allison scenes. No official source offers this version.\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on [[VHS]] in the United States by the Vestron sublabel Lightning Video in 1987. [[Lionsgate]] released the film twice on [[DVD]], once in 2004 (with special features including a featurette, commentary, still gallery, and trailer) and in 2012 as part of an 8-horror film DVD set. It was released for the first time on [[Blu-ray]] on September 27, 2016 as part of Lionsgate's new [[Vestron Video]] Collector's Series line.\n\nWynorski later said, the film \"did okay when it was released in theaters.
