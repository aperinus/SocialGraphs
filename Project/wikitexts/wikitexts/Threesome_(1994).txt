The university thought that Alex was a man (based on her name) and thus the three students are forced to live with each other until the university can move Alex to a female residence hall.\n\nAlex falls in love and tries unsuccessfully to seduce Eddy (who is gay); Eddy falls in love with Stuart; Stuart is in love with Alex.  The trio become good friends and scare off anyone who tries to seduce the other.  Eventually Alex, Stuart and Eddy agree to have an actual [[threesome]] that seems to destroy the friendship, and raises the possibility that Alex might have become pregnant.\n\nAfter the threesome, they start to drift apart. Three weeks later the semester ends; Alex moves to an apartment and Eddy gets a single dorm. Eddy (the film's narrator) eventually finds a boyfriend, Stuart finds happiness in a monogamous relationship with a woman and Alex remains single. While they now only see each other for lunch occasionally, they do not seem to regret the friendship they had while in college.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Josh Charles]] as Eddy\n* [[Lara Flynn Boyle]] as Alex\n* [[Stephen Baldwin]] as Stuart\n* [[Alexis Arquette]] as Dick\n* [[Martha Gehman]] as Renay\n* [[Mark Arnold (actor)|Mark Arnold]] as Larry\n* [[Michele Matheson]] as Kristen\n* [[Joanne Baron]] as Curt Woman\n\n==Reception==\nUpon release, the film received negative reviews. The review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 28% of critics gave ''Threesome'' positive reviews, based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 4.41/10. The site's consensus reads, \"''Threesome''{{'}}s titillating title belies a dreadfully dull drama whose attractive stars are handily outmatched by a shallow script\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/threesome/ |title=Threesome Movie Reviews, Pictures \u2013 Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=2008-08-10 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>  [[Peter Travers]]' review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine reads, \"We're supposed to get all teary when kinkiness threatens to break up a friendship that was hard to swallow in the first place. There's lots of glossy cinematography, courtesy of [[Alexander Gruszynski]], as the three lovers wander the campus separately, looking contemplative. Now there's a laugh. Eddy, a film student, actually makes reference to [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois classic, ''[[Jules et Jim|Jules and Jim]]''.
