In [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia]], the Joker brutally assaults Jason, in an abandoned warehouse with a crowbar. Jason is locked in the warehouse with a bomb, which explodes and kills him before Batman arrives.\n\nFive years later in [[Gotham City]], a mysterious vigilante called [[Red Hood]] assembles a meeting of the city's most prominent drug dealers. He announces a takeover of their drug trade, taking only 40 percent of the profit while offering them protection from both [[Black Mask (character)|Black Mask]] and Batman - under punishment of death to anyone caught dealing drugs to children.\n\nBatman stops an attempted theft of a shipment belonging to Black Mask, which is the advanced android [[Amazo]]. Batman destroys Amazo with the help of Jason's predecessor [[Dick Grayson]] a.k.a. [[Nightwing]] and discovers the thieves are working for Red Hood who then kills them. He chases Red Hood to Ace Chemicals, where an explosion destroys the facility. Batman and Nightwing interrogate the Joker at [[Arkham Asylum]] about Red Hood, but he denies involvement.\n\n[[File:Jason Todd (Batman-Under the Red Hood).png|thumb|left|[[Jason Todd]] as Red Hood (left) and as Robin (center and right)]]\n\nBlack Mask puts a hit on Red Hood for Amazo's destruction. Batman and Nightwing prevent Red Hood from hijacking Black Mask's next weapon shipment. They chase Red Hood to a train station, where he escapes after detonating a bomb, which injures Nightwing. Batman and Nightwing realize Red Hood is trained and has knowledge of Batman's tactics and gears. A review of audio footage of the chase reveals Red Hood knows Batman's secret identity.\n\nBatman recalls Jason performing the same maneuvers as Robin and that Jason grew more violent and bloodthirsty as he aged, with Batman having to stop him many times from nearly killing criminals. The Fearsome Hand of Four lure out Red Hood and nearly overpower him until Batman helps incapacitate three of them and Red Hood kills the fourth, horrifying Batman. Red Hood explains he is doing what Batman will not: killing criminals who are not afraid.\n\nBatman analyzes a blood sample of Red Hood drawn from the battle and it matches Jason's. After discovering Jason's corpse is fake, Batman confronts Ra's al Ghul and demands to know the truth. Ra's explains that he felt responsible for Jason's death and, as a peace offering, he swapped Jason's body for a fake and revived him in the [[Lazarus Pit]]. Following his resurrection, Jason was driven insane and escaped.\n\nAfter surviving an assassination attempt by Red Hood, Black Mask sets the Joker free, tasking him with killing Red Hood. However, Joker instead abducts Black Mask and the drug dealers and plans to set them on fire; Red Hood appears and reveals his real target all along has been the Joker. Batman saves the hostages and Red Hood takes the Joker. Red Hood brutally beats the Joker in revenge for his own murder and confronts Batman.\n\nDuring the fight, Red Hood removes his helmet, confirming he is Jason. Their fight makes its way to the dilapidated building where Jason is keeping the Joker and ends with Jason holding Batman at gunpoint. Though he has forgiven Batman for not saving him, Jason is upset and angry that Joker is still alive after killing him. Batman admits he has thought constantly about torturing and killing the Joker but will not, fearing he will not stop if he kills even once.\n\nJason tosses Batman a gun and gives him an ultimatum\u2014he will execute the Joker unless Batman shoots him. Batman refuses and drops the gun, causing Jason to shoot at him. Batman throws a batarang, which jams Jason's pistol. When Jason pulls the trigger again, the gun is destroyed and his right hand gets mangled. Defeated, Jason sets off a time bomb and Batman subdues the Joker before attempting to save Jason.\n\nThe bomb explodes; Batman and the Joker survive but Jason is gone. The Joker is returned to Arkham and Black Mask is arrested for his involvement in the Joker's escape. At the Batcave, Alfred offers to remove the glass case display of Jason's Robin costume after everything that has happened, but Bruce refuses, claiming it doesn't change anything.\n\nA final flashback shows Jason's first day as Robin, which he cheerfully declares is the best day of his life.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Do not add voice actors without official sources or they will be removed -->\n{{castlist|\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]\n* [[Jensen Ackles]] as [[Jason Todd]] / [[Red Hood]]<ref name=\"FullCast\">{{Cite web |last= Harvey |first= James|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php/news.php?action=fullnews&id=791|title=Complete Cast And Crew, Features Details For \"Batman: Under The Red Hood\"|publisher=worldsfinestonline.com|date=July 9, 2010|access-date=July 11, 2010}}</ref>\n** Alexander Martella as young Jason Todd<ref name=\"FullCast\" />\n** [[Vincent Martella]] as teen Jason Todd / [[Robin (character)|Robin]]<ref name=\"TWF1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php/news.php?action=fullnews&id=695 |title=The World's Finest - New Cast Details For Upcoming \"Batman: Under The Red Hood\" |publisher=Worldsfinestonline.com |date=March 11, 2010 |access-date=December 29, 2010}}</ref>\n* [[John DiMaggio]] as [[Joker (character)|Joker]]<ref name=\"FullCast\" />\n* [[Neil Patrick Harris]] as [[Dick Grayson]] / [[Nightwing]]<ref name=\"FullCast\" />\n* [[Jason Isaacs]] as [[Ra's al Ghul]]<ref name=\"FullCast\" />\n* [[Wade Williams]] as [[Black Mask (character)|Roman Sionis / Black Mask]]<ref name=\"TWF2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php/news.php?action=fullnews&id=704 |title=The World's Finest - New Cast Details For Upcoming \"Batman: Under The Red Hood\" Animated Feature |publisher=Worldsfinestonline.com |access-date=January 2, 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Jim Piddock]] as [[Alfred Pennyworth]]<ref name=\"FullCast\"/>\n* [[Gary Cole]] as [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]] (uncredited),<ref name=\"FullCast\"/> Shot (credited)<ref name=\"FullCast\"/>\n* [[Carlos Alazraqui]] as Chi Chi,<ref name=\"FullCast\"/> Thug #1 (uncredited), Baton (uncredited)\n* [[Robert Clotworthy]] as Leon<ref name=\"FullCast\"/>\n* [[Brian George]] as Ra's al Ghul's assistant\n* [[Kelly Hu]] as Ms. Li\n* [[Phil LaMarr]] as Rick,<ref name=\"FullCast\"/> Bulk (uncredited)\n* [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] as Tyler Bramford<ref name=\"FullCast\"/>\n* [[Dwight Schultz]] as Freddie,<ref name=\"FullCast\"/> Yurp\n* [[Fred Tatasciore]] as Mercenary #1,<ref name=\"FullCast\"/> [[Amazo]] (uncredited), Guard (uncredited)\n* Keri Tombazian as Fearsome Hand Leader (uncredited), Reporter #2 (credited)\n* [[Andrea Romano (voice director)|Andrea Romano]] as Reporter #1\n* [[Bruce Timm]] as [[Riddler]]<ref name=\"FullCast\"/>\n* Michael Villani as Reporter #3\n}}\n\n==Crew==\n* [[Andrea Romano (voice director)|Andrea Romano]] \u2013 Voice Director\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Batman: Under The Red Hood \u2013 Soundtrack to The Animated Original Movie\n| type       = Film score\n| artist     = [[Christopher Drake]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|July 27, 2010}}\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 57:24\n| label      = [[WaterTower Music]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\nThe score for ''Batman: Under the Red Hood'' was composed by [[Christopher Drake]],<ref name=Score>{{cite web|title=Christopher Drake|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1537113/|website=IMDb|access-date=15 October 2014}}</ref> who had previously scored several animated films set in the [[DC Universe]]. It was inspired by the soundtracks of ''[[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm]]'' which features a traditional orchestral score and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' which features a computer generated, electronic score.<ref name=oh /> Drake said that since ''Under the Red Hood'' has a darker tone than previous DC Universe animated films, he chose not to use the music as epic and melodramatic instead opting for a more intimate, minimal and restrained tone.<ref name=oh /> He added that this is the first DC film he has scored that didn't rely on using a large [[choir]] to make the fight scenes sound bigger. Drake scored the film as a reference to modern minimalist electronic scores because the film's director [[Brandon Vietti]] felt that ''Under the Red Hood'' needed to go in a different, more modern direction to separate it from previous DC animation scores. At that point, Drake introduced more electronic and ambient elements, like synthesized and processed electronic [[guitar]], while retaining orchestral elements.<ref name=oh>{{cite web|url=http://worldsfinestonline.com/WF/dcuam/redhood/backstage/drakewf.php|title=Backstage -
