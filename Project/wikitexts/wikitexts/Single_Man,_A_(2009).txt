The [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] of fashion designer [[Tom Ford]], the film stars [[Colin Firth]], who was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his portrayal of George Falconer, a depressed gay British university professor living in Southern California in 1962.\n\nThe film premiered on September 11, 2009, at the [[66th Venice International Film Festival]], and went on the film festival circuit. After it screened at the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival|34th Toronto International Film Festival]], [[The Weinstein Company]] picked it up for distribution in the United States and Germany. An initial [[Limited release|limited run]] in the United States commenced on December 11, 2009, to qualify it for the [[82nd Academy Awards]] with a [[Wide release|wider release]] in early 2010.<ref name=\"Variety.com\">{{cite news |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118008654.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title=Weinsteins engage ''Single Man'' |access-date=December 3, 2009 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first1=Michael |last1=Fleming |first2=Sharon |last2=Swart |date=September 14, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOn November 30, 1962, a month after the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], George Falconer is a middle-aged English college professor living in [[Los Angeles]]. George dreams that he encounters the body of his longtime partner, Jim, at the scene of the car accident that took Jim's life eight months earlier. He bends down to kiss his dead lover. After awakening, George delivers a voiceover discussing the pain and depression he has endured since Jim's death and his intention to end his life that evening.\n\nGeorge receives a phone call from his dearest friend, Charley, who projects lightheartedness despite her also being miserable. George goes about his day putting his affairs in order and focusing on the beauty of isolated events, believing he is seeing things for the last time. At times, he recalls his sixteen-year-long relationship with Jim.\n\nDuring the school day, George comes into contact with a student, Kenny Potter, who shows interest in George and disregards conventional boundaries of student\u2013professor discussion. George also forms an unexpected connection with a Spanish male prostitute, Carlos. That evening, George meets Charley for dinner. Though they initially reminisce and amuse themselves by dancing, Charley's desire for a deeper relationship with George and her failure to understand his relationship with Jim angers George.\n\nGeorge goes to a bar and discovers that Kenny has followed him. They get a round of drinks, go skinny dipping, and then return to George's house and continue drinking. George passes out and wakes up in bed with Kenny asleep in another room. While watching Kenny, George discovers that he has fallen asleep holding George's gun to keep George from killing himself. George locks the gun away, burns his suicide notes and in a voiceover explains that he has rediscovered the ability \"to feel, rather than think\". As he makes peace with his grief, George suffers a heart attack and dies, while envisioning Jim appearing and kissing him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Colin Firth]] as George Falconer\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Charlotte \"Charley\" Roberts\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as Kenny Potter\n* [[Matthew Goode]] as Jim\n* [[Jon Kortajarena]] as Carlos\n* Paulette Lamori as Alva\n* [[Ryan Simpkins]] as Jennifer Strunk\n* [[Ginnifer Goodwin]] as Mrs. Strunk\n* [[Teddy Sears]] as Mr. Strunk\n* Paul Butler as Christopher Strunk\n* Aaron Sanders as Tom Strunk\n* [[Lee Pace]] as Grant Lefanu\n* [[Erin Daniels]] as Bank Teller\n* [[Aline Weber]] as Lois\n{{div col end}}\n[[Jon Hamm]] has an uncredited voice cameo as Jim's cousin Harold Ackerly, who calls George to tell him of Jim's death and that the funeral is \"just for family.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Lane|last=Brown|url=https://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2009/12/don_draper_revealed_as_bearer.html|title=Don Draper Revealed as ''Single Man''{{'}}s Bearer of Bad News|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=December 10, 2009|access-date=February 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nFashion designer [[Tom Ford]], as a first-time director, financed the film himself.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tom Ford: Design Director |first=Laura M. |last=Holson |date=December 2, 2009 |access-date=December 3, 2009 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/03/fashion/03ford.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501193103/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/03/fashion/03ford.html |archive-date=May 1, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> The film places emphasis on the culture of the 1960s; the production design is by the same team that designed AMC television's ''[[Mad Men]]'', which is set in the same era.

This led to speculation that the work's gay content and themes were being deleted or diminished in its marketing materials to improve its chances of success with a wider audience. A new poster with Moore relocated to the background was issued. The film's original trailer placed more emphasis on the relationship between George and Jim but a re-cut trailer omitted a shot of George and Jim kissing while retaining a kiss between George and Charley. Also deleted were shots of George meeting hustler Carlos outside a liquor store, George and Kenny running nude into the ocean, and a shot of George staring into a male student's eyes, while keeping a shot of George staring into the eyes of a female student.<ref name=\"Indie\">{{cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/article/a_tale_of_two_trailers_the_de-gaying_of_a_single_man/# |title=A Tale of Two Trailers: The De-Gaying of ''A Single Man'' |work=IndieWire |date=October 26, 2012 |access-date=December 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSpeaking of the controversy, Moore said that director Tom Ford expressed concern that the original poster made the film appear to be a romantic comedy and that he ordered that the poster be changed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbook.com/film/julianne-moore-on-the-de-gaying-of-a-single-man/ |title=Julianne Moore on the De-Gaying of ''A Single Man'' |work=[[BlackBook]] |date=February 3, 2010 |access-date=August 27, 2015}}</ref> However Ford, noting he does not see the film in terms of gay or straight, said, \"I don't think the movie's been de-gayed. I have to say that we live in a society that's pretty weird. For example, you can have full-frontal male nudity on HBO, yet in cinema, you can't have naked male buttocks.
