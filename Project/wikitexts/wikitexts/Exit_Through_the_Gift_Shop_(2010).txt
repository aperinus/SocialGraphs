It tells the story of [[Mr. Brainwash|Thierry Guetta]], a French immigrant in Los Angeles who, over the course of several years, filmed a host of street artists at work, including [[Shepard Fairey]] and Banksy, but failed to do anything with the footage. Eventually, Banksy decided to use the footage to make a documentary, which includes new footage depicting Guetta's rise to fame as the artist \"Mr. Brainwash\". In addition to narration read by [[Rhys Ifans]], the story is largely related by Banksy himself, whose face is obscured and voice altered to preserve his anonymity. [[Geoff Barrow]] composed the film's score, and [[Richard Hawley]]'s \"Tonight The Streets Are Ours\" plays during the opening and closing credits.<ref>Willmore, Alison, [http://www.ifc.com/blogs/indie-eye/2010/01/exit-through-the-gift-shop.php \"Exit Through The Gift Shop: It's a madhouse, this modern life\"], ''The Independent Eye'', [[Independent Film Channel|IFC]] reviews of the Sundance Film Festival, 27 January 2010</ref> The film premiered at the [[2010 Sundance Film Festival]] on 24 January 2010, and it was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]] at the [[83rd Academy Awards]].\n\nSince its release, there has been extensive debate over whether the film is a genuine documentary or a [[mockumentary]]. When asked if the film is real, Banksy simply replied: \"Yes.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently asked questions|url=http://www.banksy.co.uk/QA/qaa.html|access-date=27 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103163406/http://www.banksy.co.uk/QA/qaa.html|archive-date=3 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nHis face obscured in shadow and his voice altered, [[Banksy]] tells the story of [[Mr. Brainwash|Thierry Guetta]], a French immigrant living in Los Angeles who ran a successful upscale vintage clothing shop and obsessively filmed his life. While visiting France in 1999, Guetta discovered his cousin was the [[street art]]ist [[Invader (artist)|Invader]]. Fascinated, he accompanied Invader and his friends, who included [[Andr\u00e9 (artist)|Monsieur Andr\u00e9]] and [[Zevs (artist)|Zevs]], on their nocturnal adventures, documenting everything.\n\nA few months later, Invader visited Guetta in LA and arranged a meeting with [[Shepard Fairey]]. Guetta continued to film Fairey after Invader returned to France, and when Fairey asked what Guetta planned to do with the footage, Guetta said he was going to make a documentary about street art. He followed Fairey as Fairey traveled the world executing the [[Andre the Giant Has a Posse|OBEY Giant]] campaign, and filmed numerous artists at work, among them [[Poster Boy (street artist)|Poster Boy]], Seizer, [[Neck Face]], [[Sweet Toof]], Cyclops, [[Ron English (artist)|Ron English]], [[C6.org|Dotmasters]], [[Swoon (artist)|Swoon]], Azil, [[Borf]], and [[Buff Monster]]. No one suspected Guetta just liked to film things and had no intention of making a film out of the footage, which he never watched.\n\nGuetta became obsessed with filming the mysterious Banksy, but could not arrange an introduction. Then, in spring 2006 Banksy visited LA without his usual accomplice, so he contacted Fairey, who recommended Guetta would make a good guide. Things went well, and Banksy invited Guetta to England to film the production and deployment of his \"Murdered Phone Booth\" piece, plus the crowd reaction. This confused Banksy's crew, but Banksy saw value in documenting street art, which typically has a \"short lifespan\". After Guetta returned home, he began to put up his own stickers and posters.\n\nWhen Banksy was back in LA preparing for his \"Barely Legal\" show, he took Guetta to [[Big Thunder Mountain Railroad#Disneyland version|Disneyland]] to film the reaction after he deployed an inflatable doll dressed like a [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay detainee]] there. Guetta was noticed and interrogated by security, but he was able to stash his videotape in his sock and delete his still photographs, so he was released after four hours. Following this, Banksy trusted Guetta implicitly.\n\n\"Barely Legal\" was a huge success, and the price of street art began to rocket in auction houses. Banksy was stunned by the sudden hype and urged Guetta to finish his documentary to show what the movement was really about. Over the next six months, Guetta formed his several thousand hours of footage into a film titled ''Life Remote Control'', which was an unfocused 90&nbsp;minutes of disorienting [[fast cutting]]. Banksy deemed it \"unwatchable\", but felt the street art footage itself was valuable, and decided to try to produce a film himself, casually suggesting Guetta go home, make some art, and put on a show.\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = \"I think the joke is on... I don\u2019t know who the joke is on, really. I don\u2019t even know if there is a joke.\"\n| source = \u2014 Banksy's former spokesman Steve Lazarides\n| width = 25%\n| align = right\n}}\n\nAdopting the name \"[[Mr. Brainwash]]\", Guetta mortgaged his business and home to rent equipment, hire a production team to create art under his supervision, and rent the 15,000 square-foot former-CBS Studios complex for his first show, \"Life Is Beautiful\". Banksy became worried things were out of control and sent some professionals to help. They took care of the show's practical considerations, while Guetta focused on publicity. He got quotes from Fairey and Banksy, after which the ''[[LA Weekly]]'' did a cover story about the show, but he still had not chosen which of his team's works he wanted to include. The press led private art collectors to call Guetta about buying pieces before the opening, and he quoted prices of tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe day of the opening, the nearly 200 paintings finally arrived to be hung, but Guetta was busy giving interviews, so the crew decided where to put them. The doors opened, and over 4,000 people saw the show that day. Almost a million dollars' worth of Guetta's art was sold the first week of the show, which was extended by two months, and his pieces were included in shows and galleries around the world. The success of Mr. Brainwash confused Banksy and Fairey, who found Guetta derivative and unready for the world stage, but Guetta insisted time would tell whether or not he was a real artist. The closing titles reveal Guetta went on to create the cover artwork for [[Madonna]]'s [[Greatest hits album|hits collection]] ''[[Celebration (Madonna album)|Celebration]]''.\n\n==Production==\nAbout the film's arduous editing process, Banksy said: \"I spent a year [...] watching footage of sweaty vandals falling off ladders\",<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/drawn-from-the-shadows-wanted-man-comes-out-to-play-20100528-wlcx.html|title=Drawn from the shadows, wanted man comes out to play|author=Kylie Northover | work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=29 May 2010}}</ref> and \"The film was made by a very small team.

Audiences, however, would be advised simply to enjoy the film on its face \u2013 even if that face is a carefully contrived mask.\"</ref> while [[Ty Burr]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', who found the film to be quite entertaining and awarded it four out of four stars, dismissed the notion of it being a \"put on\", writing: \"I'm not buying it; for one thing, this story's too good, too weirdly rich, to be made up. For another, the movie's gently amused scorn lands on everyone.\"<ref>Burr, Ty, [https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2010/04/23/in_exit_documentary_street_art_scene_becomes_a_farce/ \"Exit Through the Gift Shop: Writing\u2019s on the wall: In \u2018Exit,\u2019 street art scene becomes a farce\"], ''The Boston Globe'', 23 April 2010</ref> [[Roger Ebert]], who gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, wrote: \"The widespread speculation that ''Exit Through the Gift Shop'' is a hoax only adds to its fascination.\"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=28 April 2010 |title= Exit Through the Gift Shop movie review (2010)|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/exit-through-the-gift-shop-2010 |access-date=25 November 2020|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with [[SuicideGirls]], producer Jaimie D'Cruz and editor Chris King denied the film was a hoax and expressed their growing frustration with speculation it was. King said: \"For a while we all thought that was quite funny, but it went on for so long.
