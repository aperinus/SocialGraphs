It stars [[Gena Rowlands]] as a [[philosophy]] professor who accidentally overhears the private analysis of a stranger, and finds the woman's regrets and despair awaken something personal in her.\n\nModern film critics view ''Another Woman'' favorably.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}\n\n==Plot==\nMarion Post is a New York philosophy professor over 50 on a leave of absence to write a new book. Due to construction work in her building, she sublets a furnished apartment downtown for peace and quiet.\n\nHer work there is interrupted by voices from a neighboring office in the building where a therapist conducts his analysis. She quickly realizes that she is privy to the despairing sessions of another woman, Hope, who is disturbed by a growing feeling that her life is false and empty. Her words strike a chord in Marion, who begins to question herself in the same way.\n\nMarion comes to realize that, like her father, she has been unfair, unkind and judgmental to the people closest to her: her unsuccessful brother Paul and his wife Lynn, who feel they embarrass her; her best friend from high school Claire, who feels eclipsed by her; her first husband Sam, who eventually committed suicide; and her stepdaughter Laura, who admires her but resents her high-handedness.\n\nShe also realizes that her marriage to her second husband, Ken, is unfulfilling and that she missed her one chance at love with his best friend, Larry. She finally manages to meet the woman in therapy as she contemplates a [[Klimt]] painting called \"[[Hope 1|Hope]]\". Although she wants to know more about the woman, she ends up talking more about herself, realizing that she made a mistake by having an abortion years ago and that at her age there are many things in life she will not have anymore.\n\nMarion leaves Ken after catching him in an affair. She resolves to change her life for the better, and takes steps to repair her relationship with Paul and Laura. By the end of the film, she reflects that, for the first time in years, she feels hopeful.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Gena Rowlands]] as Marion Post\n* [[Ian Holm]] as Ken Post\n* [[Mia Farrow]] as Hope\n* [[Blythe Danner]] as Lydia\n* [[Betty Buckley]] as Kathy\n* [[John Houseman]] as Marion's Father\n* [[Sandy Dennis]] as Claire\n* [[Frances Conroy]] as Lynn\n* [[Philip Bosco]] as Sam\n* [[Martha Plimpton]] as Laura\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as Paul\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Larry Lewis\n* [[David Ogden Stiers]] as Young Marion's Father\n}}\n\n==Background==\n''Another Woman'' borrows heavily from the films of Allen's idol [[Ingmar Bergman]], particularly ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]'', whose main character is an elderly professor who learns from a close relative that his family hates him. Allen also recreates some of ''Wild Strawberries''<nowiki/>'s dream sequences, and puts Marion into a similar situation as Isak Borg: both characters reexamine their life after friends and family accuse them of being cold and unfeeling. The film has many of Allen's signature features, particularly the [[New York City]] setting; only a few scenes are shot outside the city, in the [[Hamptons]]. It also uses classical music ([[Claude Debussy]]'s orchestral arrangement of [[Erik Satie]]'s ''[[Gymnop\u00e9die|Gymnop\u00e9die No. 1]]'', renamed ''Gymnop\u00e9die No. 3''), and poetry ([[Rainer Maria Rilke]]'s \"Archaic Torso of Apollo\") to serve its narrative, as do earlier and later films such as ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'', and ''[[Husbands and Wives]]''. It focuses primarily on [[upper middle class]] [[intellectual]]s, as nearly all of Allen's 1980s films do.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Another Woman'' received modest praise from critics and holds a 59% positive \"Rotten\" rating on the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 27 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |title=Another Woman (1988) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/another_woman/ |access-date=June 29, 2022 |archive-date=September 1, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150901064051/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/another_woman/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nTim Robey of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' called the film \"one of [Allen's] shortest, least funny, and very best films\".<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/recommendations/10046469/Tim-Robey-recommends...-Another-Woman-1988.html| title=Tim Robey recommends...

The rounded sentences sound as if they'd been written in a French influenced by Flaubert, then translated into English by a lesser student of Constance Garnett.\" He added, \"Mr. Allen is becoming an immensely sophisticated director, but this screenplay is in need of a merciless literary editor.
