In the film, three high school pupils decide to hire an adult bodyguard to protect them from two bullies who endlessly harass and abuse them before developing a friendly relationship with him.\n\nThe film stars [[Owen Wilson]] as the eponymous role, alongside Nate Hartley, [[Troy Gentile]], [[David Dorfman]], [[Alex Frost]], [[Josh Peck]] and [[Leslie Mann]] in supporting roles.\n\n''Drillbit Taylor'' was released by [[Paramount Pictures]] on March 21, 2008. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews, with criticism directed mainly toward the screenwriting, the direction and the mean-spirited nature, but praised the humor, Wilson's performance and the chemistry between the cast.\n\n==Plot==\nOn the first day of high school, freshmen Wade and Ryan witness bullies Filkins and Ronnie attack a [[geek]], Emmit, stuffing him into his locker. Wade intervenes, so the two begin endlessly targeting Wade, Ryan and Emmit. Emmit also befriends the duo, much to Ryan's dismay.\n\nWade suggests hiring a bodyguard. They place an ad on the Internet, and after a series of disturbing interviews with ex-cons and hired guns, they end up selecting Drillbit Taylor. Drillbit pretends to be a martial arts expert and mercenary, but is really a homeless beggar. His real intention of becoming their bodyguard was to rob them and use the money to buy a ticket to Canada. \n\nDrillbit suggests they find some common interests with Filkins and Ronnie. Ryan challenges Filkins to a [[rap battle]], but gets carried away and ends up unintentionally humiliating him. So, an angry Filkins, alongside Ronnie, ambushes the trio. Trying out a tactic Drillbit taught them ultimately fails. The boys are furious with his teachings. But they decide to bring him to school as a substitute teacher, and in that capacity he is able to protect them. While there, Drillbit meets a teacher, Lisa Zachey, and they start a sexual relationship.\n\nOne morning as his mother is driving him to school, Ronnie sees Drillbit showering at the beach; his mother reveals that he is homeless. Filkins finds the boys and punches Drillbit. Later, at Wade's, they catch Drillbit's homeless friends stealing everything in sight, leaving the house completely empty. Drillbit confesses that his real name is Bob and he went [[AWOL]] from the U.S. Army and his name was Drillbit because he hurt his pinky finger in high school with a drillbit. \n\nThe boys fire Drillbit, who later recovers all of Wade's possessions and places them back before Wade's parents return home. Unfortunately, the boys accidentally let slip about Drillbit. Their parents take things up with the principal, who contacts the police. Filkins plays innocent and charms all the adults; Filkins continues to ridicule the boys after Drillbit's disappearance. Tensions finally burst when Filkins interrupts Wade's attempt to ask his crush, Brooke Nguyen, out. Without thinking, Wade challenges Filkins to a fight. After Ryan insults Emmit, he refuses to help them.\n\nWade and Ryan arrive at Filkins' house, where he is hosting a party; initially the duo knock him down, but he soon overpowers them. Ronnie shows up to help Filkins against them. Emmit, who has a change of heart, comes to their aid and for a while causes quite a lot of pain to Filkins, almost defeating him; but Ronnie knocks him out while he is trying to break Filkins' leg.\n\nDrillbit shows up and Filkins punches him. Drillbit refuses to fight back until it is revealed Filkins is 18, no longer an emancipated minor. Hearing this, Drillbit quickly begins fighting to defend the freshmen. He doesn't attack Ronnie when he reveals he's only 17. Within minutes, the police arrive and Drillbit flees for fear of prosecution. Filkins then throws a samurai sword at the boys in retaliation, but Drillbit catches it. He saves them, at the cost of half of his pinkie. Ronnie reveals to the police that Filkins had bullied him into being his accomplice when they interview him.\n\nFilkins is arrested and shipped off to Hong Kong with his parents as an alternative to being sent to prison for breaking several underage drinking laws. Wade, with renewed confidence, asks Brooke out and she accepts, while Ryan finally accepts Emmit, and declares him a friend. \n\nDrillbit is taken to jail for deserting, but ends up being released within three weeks. He is reunited with Lisa and the boys and is soon employed at their school as a nurse. A post-credits scene shows a student entering the nurse's office telling Drillbit he received bruises from being beaten up. Drillbit then asks him forthe name of the student, assuring he'll be safer from then on.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Drillbit Taylor\n* [[Leslie Mann]] as Lisa\n* Nate Hartley as Wade\n* [[Troy Gentile]] as Ryan\n* [[David Dorfman]] as Emmit\n* [[Alex Frost]] as Filkins\n* [[Josh Peck]] as Ronnie\n* [[Danny McBride]] as Don\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Principal Doppler\n* [[Lisa Ann Walter]] as Delores\n* [[Ian Roberts (American actor)|Ian Roberts]] as Jim\n* [[Beth Littleford]] as Barbara\n}}\n\nIn addition, Valerie Tian plays Brooke, the girl Wade is sweet on, while cameo appearances include standup comics [[Kevin Hart]] and [[Lisa Lampanelli]], the film's director, [[Steven Brill (filmmaker)|Steven Brill]], and  \"bodyguard candidates\" that include [[Israeli Defence Force]] martial arts expert and Israel's Heavyweight Full Contact Champion [[Amir Perets]], [[List of UFC champions#Light Heavyweight Championship|UFC Light Heavyweight Champion]] [[Chuck Liddell]], and [[Adam Baldwin]], who makes a dismissive reference to the plot of his 1980 film ''[[My Bodyguard]]''.\n\n==Marketing==\nMarketing for the movie included television promos and coming attractions previews, but actor [[Owen Wilson]] did not conduct any interviews to promote the film. Instead, [[Paramount Pictures]] had Wilson record introductions for [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s Sunday night primetime shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[Unhitched]]''. The character of Drillbit was also featured as a \"Superstar\" on the RAW page of [[WWE.com]] for a period of time. Wilson's publicist said his availability was limited due to filming ''[[Marley & Me (film)|Marley & Me]]''.\n\nJohn Horn and Gina Piccalo of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that the reason for Wilson's limited promotional schedule was due to studio executives being worried that interviewers would bring up Wilson's hospitalization for severe depression in the summer of 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-word20mar20,1,4790174.story |title=Owen Wilson sits out 'Drillbit Taylor' promotion |access-date=2008-03-20 |author=John Horn and Gina Piccalo |date=2008-03-20 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080323172749/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-word20mar20,1,4790174.story <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2008-03-23}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nIn its opening weekend, the film grossed $10.2 million in 3,056 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking #4 at the box office.<ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&id=drillbittaylor.htm |title=Drillbit Taylor (2008) - Weekend Box Office Results |access-date=2008-03-24 |publisher=Amazon.com |work = [[Box Office Mojo]] }}</ref> The film has grossed $32,862,104 in the United States and $16,828,521 in other countries adding to a total worldwide gross of $49,690,625.\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of {{RT data|score}} based on reviews from {{RT data|average}} critics, with an average rating of {{RT data|average}}.
