The [[screenplay]] by Perelman and [[Shawn Lawrence Otto]] is based on the [[House of Sand and Fog (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Andre Dubus III]].\n\nThe story concerns the battle between a young woman and an immigrant Iranian family over the ownership of a house in Northern California, which ultimately leads to the destruction of five lives. The film was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] ([[Ben Kingsley]]), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] ([[Shohreh Aghdashloo]]), and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] (James Horner).\n\n==Plot==\nAbandoned by her husband, recovering drug addict Kathy Nicolo, living alone in a small house near the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], ignores eviction notices erroneously sent to her for nonpayment of business taxes. Assuming the misunderstanding was cleared up, she is surprised when Sheriff's Deputy Lester Burdon arrives to forcibly evict her. Telling Kathy that her home is to be auctioned off, Lester feels sympathy for her, helps her move out, and advises her to seek legal assistance to regain her house.\n\nFormer [[Imperial Iranian Army]] colonel Massoud Amir Behrani, who fled his homeland with his family, now lives in the Bay Area working multiple menial jobs. Living beyond his means, he maintains the fa\u00e7ade of a respectable businessman so as not to shame his wife Nadereh, son Esmail, and daughter Soraya. He buys Kathy's house for a quarter of its actual value, intending to improve and sell it. Kathy is evicted from the motel she is staying in. With nowhere else to go, she spends the night in her car. Seeing the renovations and how the Behranis have settled in makes her determined to get her house back and she finds an attorney, Connie Walsh, who assures her that because of the county's mistake, they will return Massoud's money and restore the house to her.\n\nMassoud, having already spent money on improving the house, is unwilling to accept anything less than the higher value of the property, which the county refuses to pay. Connie advises Kathy that her only option is now to sue the county, though it will take months. Kathy tries to convince Massoud to sell back the house; he too advises her to sue the county and promises to sell her the house back if she comes up with the money, but she retaliates by beginning to harass him and his family in front of potential buyers. Desperate for help, Kathy falls easily into an affair with Lester, who abandons his wife and children and fashions himself as Kathy's protector. Under a pseudonym, Lester threatens to have Massoud and his family deported if he refuses to sell the house back to the county. Aware that Lester was acting on Kathy's behalf, Massoud reports this to Internal Affairs, who severely reprimand Lester, and furiously warns Kathy to leave his family alone. Kathy calls her brother Frank for help, but cannot bring herself to admit that she is homeless.\n\nDespondent, she becomes drunk and attempts suicide in the driveway with Lester's sidearm. Massoud finds her drunkenly unable to discharge the gun, and brings her inside. Kathy tries to kill herself again with pills, but Nadereh saves her. As she and her husband carry Kathy to the bedroom, Lester breaks in and sees Kathy unconscious. In a xenophobic rage, Lester locks the Behranis in their own bathroom, refusing to let them out until Massoud agrees to relinquish the house. Massoud offers to sell the house and will give Kathy the money in exchange for her putting the house in his name. Lester takes Massoud to the county office to finalize the transaction.\n\nOutside the office, Lester begins to manhandle Massoud and Esmail seizes Lester's gun and aims it at him. Massoud draws the attention of police officers who misinterpret the situation and shoot Esmail instead of Lester. Massoud is arrested but is released after Lester confesses and is incarcerated.\n\nMassoud begs God to save his son but Esmail does not survive. Believing they have nothing left to live for, Massoud kills Nadereh by lacing her tea with pills. He then dons his old military uniform, tapes a plastic dust cover over his head, and [[asphyxiates]] himself while clutching his wife's hand. Kathy discovers the couple and frantically attempts to resuscitate Massoud but she is too late. As the bodies of Massoud and Nadereh are taken away by paramedics, a policeman asks Kathy if the house is hers. After a long pause, she says no.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Kathy Nicolo\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as Colonel Amir Massud Behrani\n* [[Shohreh Aghdashloo]] as Nadereh \"Nadi\" Behrani\n* [[Ron Eldard]] as Lester Burdon\n* [[Frances Fisher]] as Connie Walsh\n* [[Jonathan Ahdout]] as Esmail Behrani\n* [[Kim Dickens]] as Carol Burdon\n* [[Carlos G\u00f3mez (actor)|Carlos G\u00f3mez]] as Lieutenant Alvarez\n* [[Navi Rawat]] as Soraya Behrani\n*[[Al Rodrigo]] as Torez\n*[[Marco Rodr\u00edguez (actor)|Marco Rodr\u00edguez]] as Mendez\n*[[Aki Aleong]] as Tran\n*Cooper Thornton as Gary\n*[[Ray Abruzzo]] as Frank\n*[[Spencer Garrett]] as Auctioneer\n\n==Production==\n[[Shohreh Aghdashloo]] was a respected actress in Iran before immigrating to the United States. When the film roles offered to her were limited to [[Terrorism|terrorists]] and other assorted [[villain]]s, she turned to a career in the theater. This film marked her return to the screen after nearly two decades.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''House of Sand and Fog'' DVD Special Features</ref>\n\n[[Jonathan Ahdout]], whose previous acting experience was limited to school plays, was cast as Esmail Behrani two days prior to the start of filming. His original audition had not impressed Vadim Perelman, but when he began to have doubts about the actor he ultimately had hired, he reviewed the audition tapes and saw something in Ahdout's performance he felt he previously had overlooked. He called him back and had him meet and perform with Aghdashloo. The chemistry between them convinced Perelman the boy was right for the part.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n==Soundtrack==\nAn [[House of Sand and Fog (soundtrack)|original soundtrack album]] featuring [[James Horner]]'s [[film score]], was released by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]].\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film received positive reviews from critics.

O. Scott]] called the film \"an impressively self-assured directing debut\" and added, \"[it] is the nearly flawless execution of a deeply flawed premise. Mr. Perelman inadvertently exposes the inconsistencies in Mr. Dubus's novel even as he comes very close to overcoming them ... the conflict between Kathy and Behrani arises from a sin so trivial as to be almost comical ... and every stage of its escalation seems determined less by the psychology of the characters than by the forced, schematic logic of the story.
