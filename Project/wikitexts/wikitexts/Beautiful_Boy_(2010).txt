A young man reads a short story to a small group about a boy and girl; saying that they didn't know it, but their lives would one day irrevocably change. But he finds that none of the group are paying attention to him. Bill ([[Michael Sheen]]) and Kate ([[Maria Bello]]) are a married couple who are tightly wound and devoted to their work. Bill is a businessman, and Kate proofreads books for a living. The only thing keeping them together is their eighteen-year-old son Sam ([[Kyle Gallner]]), who is having trouble adjusting to college.\n\nOne morning, it is reported on the news that there has been a [[school shooting|shooting spree]] at Sam's school. They are then visited by the police who inform them that Sam is not only dead, but that he was the gunman. Kate refuses to believe that their son would do something so horrible, and spends the night tidying up Sam's room which had been searched by the police. As the news media descends upon the couple the following day, Bill and Kate decide to stay with Kate's brother Eric ([[Alan Tudyk]]) and his wife Trish ([[Moon Bloodgood]]). The next morning, Eric and Trish's son Dylan (Cody Wai-Ho Lee) turns on the television to see a video made by Sam about the impending massacre. Bill then decides to issue a public statement, saying that they are both deeply sorry over what has happened, and ask for their privacy as they endeavor to get their lives back on track. They have a small funeral with only family present.\n\nTrish soon becomes agitated at Kate's nit-picking, and her attempts to mother Dylan, but Eric says that she has to be sensitive to their situation since Sam was her only child. They eventually leave, saying they are going to visit a friend, but check into a motel instead. The manager ([[Meat Loaf]]) not knowing who they are, makes a comment about Sam and his \"monster family\". Bill and Kate spend the night together seeming to rekindle their romantic feelings. Then Bill goes back to the house where he finds a teenage boy in Sam's room going through his belongings. They have a short scuffle where Bill cuts his hand, and the boy calls him a \"psycho\". He returns to the motel with their laptop, and finds a video from Sam. He and Kate view it together; Sam only says \"mom and dad , I'm sorry, please don't hate me\".\n\nBill and Kate get into an argument about what could have caused Sam to kill all those innocent people. Bill lashes out at Kate for always critiquing every decision that Sam ever made, but she says that he was never there for them because he was always so busy working. Bill ends up yelling that he wishes that Sam was never born, and Kate leaves.\n\nKate goes back to their house for the first time since the shooting, and looks through Sam's room. Bill meets with his boss Harry ([[Bruce French (actor)|Bruce French]]), who reluctantly agrees that he can return to work next week. While grocery shopping, Kate runs into her young co-worker Cooper ([[Austin Nichols]]). They go back to the house, after sharing a sad memory he excuses himself for the bathroom. Kate then discovers Cooper is actually researching Sam when she finds Cooper's notebook. She catches him in Sam's room looking through Sam's stories. He explains that he is writing a piece about the shooting, but that he wanted to portray Sam in a more human light by learning more about him. Saddened, Kate asks him to leave. Bill finally returns to work, but feels alienated by the rest of the staff who keep staring at him. After Bill furiously demands what their problem is, Harry tells Bill to take more time off to see a therapist, so he quits.\n\nBill later visits the cemetery to find Sam's gravestone vandalized, with the word ''killer'' written on it. He breaks down both physically and emotionally as he tries to scrub the word off with his bandaged hand. Kate reads all of Sam's stories, and goes to Sam's gravestone as well. She gets a call from the motel manager about Bill, and finds him curled up and depressed in their old room. Kate embraces the emotionally distraught Bill, and takes him home.\n\nSam's voice is heard again as he ends his short story about the boy and girl. He says that no matter what they do, their lives will never be the same.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Michael Sheen]] as Bill Carroll\n*[[Maria Bello]] as Kate Carroll\n*[[Alan Tudyk]] as Eric\n*[[Moon Bloodgood]] as Trish\n*[[Kyle Gallner]] as Sam Carroll\n**Logan South as young Sam Carroll\n*[[Meat Loaf]] as the motel manager\n*[[Bruce French (actor)|Bruce French]] as Harry\n*[[Austin Nichols]] as Cooper\n*Gregory Alpert as Baby Shower Carl, Web Reporter Voice\n*Deidrie Henry as Bonnie\n*Kelli Kirkland as TV News Reporter (as Kelli Kirkland Powers)\n*[[David Lipper]] as Radio Reporter Voice, Television Ranter\n*Nigel Gibbs as Detective\n*[[Brooke Lyons]] as TV Reporter Voice\n*Michael Call as TV Reporter Voice\n*Cody Wai-Ho Lee as Dylan\n*[[Jessie Usher]] as Basketball Teen\n*Davidson Park as Other Basketball Player\n*Caleb Pearson as Other Basketball Player\n*Joshua Shannon as Other Basketball Player\n*Darren O'Hare as Church Pastor\n*[[Myra Turley]] as Grieving Mother Patty\n*Bella King as Motel Clerk's Daughter\n*Drake Kemper as Teenage Burglar\n*Kylie Anderson as Bill's Coworker\n*Mary Jane Gibson as Bill's Coworker\n*Tor Campbell as Bill's Coworker\n*Stephen Murano as Bill's Coworker\n*Judith DiGiacomo as Bill's Coworker\n*Josephine Ullrich as Bill's Coworker\n*Joe Dioletto as Bill's Coworker\n*Philip Zurfluh as Bill's Coworker\n*Jen Taylor as Guitar Player (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nFilming took place in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]], [[California]].\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://web.archive.org/web/20120427104731/http://www.beautifulboythemovie.com/}} (Archived from the original)\n* {{IMDb title|1533013|Beautiful Boy}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|Beautiful_Boy|Beautiful Boy}}\n\n[[Category:2010 films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010 drama films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about school violence]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Shawn Ku]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]"}]}}}}
