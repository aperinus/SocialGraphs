His friend (and his brother's ex-girlfriend) Iris offers to let him stay at her father's isolated island cabin, to restore his spirits. Upon arrival, he finds Iris's sister Hannah, a lesbian who has recently broken up with her partner and is staying at the cabin without Iris's knowledge.\n\nThey talk and drink together, and end up sleeping together, using Hannah's condom. Iris arrives at the cabin unexpectedly the next morning, and Jack suggests that he and Hannah shouldn't tell her they slept together. Iris later tells her sister that she's fallen in love with Jack.\n\nThe next day, Iris mentions that Hannah wants to have a baby. Jack examines the used condom, and finds Hannah had poked holes in it. Hannah confesses to Iris she slept with Jack. Iris confronts Jack about it, and Jack accuses Hannah of [[sperm theft|stealing his sperm]]. Hannah admits it, but says she would never have slept with Jack if she had known Iris was in love with him. Jack is stunned to hear Iris loves him, and Iris is stunned that Hannah told him.\n\nLater that night, Jack talks to Iris and apologizes. He reveals to Iris that he was only with Hannah because he can't be with her, which breaks Iris's heart because they could have avoided it all if only they had confessed their feelings towards each other sooner. Both Jack and Iris break down crying, and Jack leaves. Over the next day or so, the sisters gradually reconcile, with Iris offering to help Hannah to raise the child should she give birth.\n\nEventually, Jack returns to the cabin and requites Iris's love, also offering to help Hannah to take care of her possible baby. The trio return to the city, and the final scene has Hannah taking a [[home pregnancy test]] with Iris and Jack joining her to see the result, which is not revealed.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Emily Blunt]] as Iris\n* [[Rosemarie DeWitt]] as Hannah\n* [[Mark Duplass]] as Jack\n* [[Mike Birbiglia]] as Al\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in 12 days<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/20/your-sisters-sister-film-review|title=Your Sister's Sister \u2013 review|author=Matt Mueller|work=the Guardian|date=20 September 2011 }}</ref> on [[Fidalgo Island]] and in the [[San Juan Islands]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state.<ref>{{citation| title=Scriptless in Seattle: A Filmmaker's Map\u2014Lynn Shelton, Director of 'Your Sister's Sister'| first=Margy | last=Rochlin | date=May 4, 2012 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/movies/lynn-shelton-director-of-your-sisters-sister.html}}</ref> [[Rachel Weisz]] was originally cast to play the character of Hannah, but had to drop out three days before the shoot.
