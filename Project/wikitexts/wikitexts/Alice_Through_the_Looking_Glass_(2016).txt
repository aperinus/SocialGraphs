It is based on the [[Through the Looking-Glass#Characters|characters]] created by [[Lewis Carroll]] and is the sequel to the 2010 film ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', a live-action reimagining of [[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Disney's 1951 animated film of the same name]]. The film stars [[Johnny Depp]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Mia Wasikowska]], [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]], [[Rhys Ifans]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] and features the voices of [[Stephen Fry]], [[Michael Sheen]], [[Timothy Spall]], [[Barbara Windsor]], [[Matt Vogel (puppeteer)|Matt Vogel]], [[Paul Whitehouse]], and [[Alan Rickman]]. This also features Rickman, Windsor and [[Andrew Sachs]] in their final film roles prior to their deaths. In the film, a now 22-year-old [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] comes across a magical looking glass that takes her back to [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]], where she finds that the [[The Hatter|Mad Hatter]] is acting madder than usual and wants to discover the truth about his family. Alice then travels through time (with the \"Chronosphere\"), comes across friends and enemies at different points of their lives, and embarks on a race to save the Hatter before time runs out.\n\nThe film premiered in [[London]] on May 10, 2016, and was theatrically released on May 27, 2016, by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]]. ''Alice Through the Looking Glass'' received generally negative reviews from critics, with praise for its performances and visual effects, but criticism for its story and characters. The film was commercially unsuccessful, grossing roughly $299 million against a budget of $170 million.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, please keep the world count reasonable. The plot summary should be under 700 words. -->\n[[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice Kingsleigh]] has spent the past three years following her father's footsteps and sailing the high seas. Upon her return to [[19th-century London|London]] from [[China]], she learns that her ex-fianc\u00e9, Hamish Ascot, has taken over his deceased father's company and plans to have Alice sign over her father's ship in exchange for her family home.  Alice follows a butterfly she recognizes as [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Absolem the Butterfly]], who was previously a caterpillar, and returns to [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]] through a mirror. Alice is greeted by the [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]], the [[White Rabbit]], the [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee#2010|Tweedles]], the [[The Dormouse|Dormouse]], the [[March Hare]], the [[Puppy (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Bloodhound]] and the [[Cheshire Cat]]. They inform her that the [[Hatter (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Mad Hatter]] is acting madder than usual because his family is missing.\n\nAlice tries to console him, but he remains certain that his family survived the attack of the [[Jabberwocky]]. The White Queen, believing that finding the Hatter's family is the only way to restore his health, sends Alice to consult Time and convince him to save the Hatter's family in the past. The White Queen warns Alice that history will be destroyed if a person's past and present selves meet. Upon entering the Castle of Eternity, Alice finds the Chronosphere, an object that controls all of time in Wonderland. After Time tells Alice that altering the past is impossible, she steals the Chronosphere and travels back in time, shortly after finding the exiled [[Red Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|Red Queen]] in Time's care. The Red Queen orders Time to pursue Alice, who accidentally travels to the Red Queen's coronation. There, a younger Mad Hatter mocks the Red Queen when the royal crown does not fit her abnormal head. When her crown breaks, the Red Queen throws a tantrum that causes her head to swell. Her father deems her unfit to rule and passes the title of queen to her younger sister, the White Queen.\n\nAlice learns of an event in both the Queens' pasts that causes friction between the two, and she travels back in time again, hoping to change the Red Queen's character and stop the [[Jabberwocky]] from killing the Hatter's family. The young White Queen steals a tart from her mother and eats it. When confronted by their mother, she lies about eating the tart, which gets her sister accused and causes her to run out of the castle in a fit. Alice sees her about to run into a clock and believes this to be the event that deforms her head and personality. She manages to move the clock out of the way, but fails to change the past as the Red Queen actually stumbles and hits her head. Alice is confronted by a weakened Time, who berates her for putting all of time in danger. She runs into a nearby mirror back into the real world, where she wakes up in a mental hospital, diagnosed with [[female hysteria]]. With the help of her mother, she returns to Wonderland, where she travels to the Jabberwocky attack and discovers that the Hatter's family did not die, but were captured by the Red Queen's [[List of minor characters in the Alice series#The Playing Cards|Red Knights]].\n\nReturning to the present, Alice discovers the Mad Hatter at the brink of death. After Alice tearfully says that she believes him, the Hatter awakens and reforms back to his normal self. The Wonderlanders go to the Red Queen's castle and find the Hatter's family shrunk and trapped in an ant farm. The Red Queen apprehends them and steals the Chronosphere from Alice, taking her sister back to the day she lied about the tart. By the time Alice and Hatter get there, the Red Queen and her past self see each other. This creates a time paradox, and Wonderland quickly turns to rust. Using the Chronosphere, Alice and the Hatter race back to the present, where Alice is able to place the Chronosphere back in its original place. With the Chronosphere stabilized, Wonderland reverts to normal. The Mad Hatter reunites with his family. The White Queen apologizes to her sister for lying, and both of them make amends. Alice bids her friends farewell and returns to the real world where her mother refuses to turn Alice's ship over to Hamish, and the two set to travel the world on behalf of their own company.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Tarrant Hightopp]] / [[Hatter (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Mad Hatter]]<ref name=\"collider1\" />\n** [[Louis Ashbourne Serkis]] as Young Tarrant Hightopp<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.romper.com/p/who-plays-the-young-hatter-in-alice-through-the-looking-glass-the-kid-actor-is-adorable-11350|title=Who Plays The Young Hatter In 'Alice Through The Looking Glass'?
