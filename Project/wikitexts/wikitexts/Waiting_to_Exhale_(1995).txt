The film was adapted from the 1992 novel of the same name by [[Terry McMillan]]. [[Lela Rochon]], [[Loretta Devine]], [[Dennis Haysbert]], [[Michael Beach]], [[Gregory Hines]], [[Donald Faison]], and [[Mykelti Williamson]] rounded out the rest of the cast. The original music score was composed by [[Babyface (musician)|Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds]]. The story centers on four women living in the [[Phoenix, Arizona]] area and their relationships with men and one another. All of them are \"holding their breath\" until the day they can feel comfortable in a committed relationship with themselves.\n\n==Plot==\nFour friends (Savannah, Robin, Bernadine, and Gloria) get together frequently to support one another and listen to each other vent about life and love. They each want to be in a romantic relationship, but they each have difficulties finding a good man.\n\nSuccessful television producer Savannah \"Vannah\" Jackson believes that one day her married lover will leave his wife for her. She later realizes that he won't, and that she must find her own man who will love her for who she really is.\n\nBernadine \"Bernie\" Harris, who abandoned her career and dreams of having a catering business, instead raised a family and supported her husband John in building his business. He announces he is leaving her for a white woman with whom he works, sending her into an emotional tailspin that culminates in the two fighting over their assets after she burns his car, clothes and some of his other belongings, and then sells the rest of his things for a dollar each, and he retaliates by draining their bank accounts.\n\nRobin Stokes is a high-powered executive and the long-time mistress of married Russell. After dumping him, she has problems finding someone suitable.\n\nBeauty salon owner Gloria \"Glo\" Matthews is a single mother. Her ex-husband and the father of her son tells her that he was always bisexual and now realizes he is gay. Gloria eventually falls in love with a new neighbor, Marvin King.\n\nThe situations all resolve themselves for the better. Savannah ends up permanently dumping her married lover. Bernadine gets a large divorce settlement from her ex-husband and finds love with a widowed [[civil rights]] [[Lawyer|attorney]] who encourages her to pursue her catering dream. Robin ends up pregnant by her married lover, but dumps him, and chooses to raise the baby on her own.\nGloria apologizes to her neighbor for snapping at him when he suggested that she should let her son grow up and experience the world. She learns not to be so protective of her son and lets him go on an \"[[Up with People]]\" trip to [[Spain]]. She finds love while learning to take care of herself rather than being self-sacrificing in her devotion to her son and her business.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Whitney Houston]] as Savannah Jackson, a successful television producer who after few failed relationships, decides to move from [[Denver]], [[Colorado]] to Phoenix, Arizona\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as Bernadine Harris, a mother of two children with dreams of starting a catering business shelved by her 11-year marriage to her husband, only for him to drop a bomb: he's divorcing her for his white bookkeeper.\n* [[Loretta Devine]] as Gloria Matthews, a beauty salon owner & single mother of Tarik\n* [[Lela Rochon]] as Robin Stokes, an executive and the long-time [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] of Russell\n* [[Gregory Hines]] as Marvin King, Gloria's neighbor with whom she falls in love, decides to move from [[Nevada]] to Phoenix, Arizona\n* [[Dennis Haysbert]] as Kenneth Dawkins, Savannah's married lover\n* [[Mykelti Williamson]] as Troy, Robin's one-time lover\n* [[Michael Beach]] as John Harris Sr., Bernie's husband who leaves her for a white woman\n* [[Donald Faison|Donald Adeosun Faison]] as Tarik Matthews, Gloria's teenage son\n* [[Leon Robinson]] as Russell, Robin's long-time married lover\n* [[Wendell Pierce]] as Michael Davenport, Robin's co-worker and [[one-night stand]]\n* [[Jeffrey D.
