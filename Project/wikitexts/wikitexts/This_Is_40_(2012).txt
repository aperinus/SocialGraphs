A \"[[Spin-off (media)|sort-of]] [[sequel]]\" to Apatow's 2007 film ''[[Knocked Up]]'', the movie centers on married couple Pete (Rudd) and Debbie (Mann), characters introduced in the previous film, whose stressful relationship is compounded by each turning 40. [[John Lithgow]], [[Megan Fox]], and [[Albert Brooks]] appear in supporting roles.\n\nFilming was conducted in mid-2011, and ''This Is 40'' was released in North America on December 21, 2012. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its cast, acting (particularly Mann, Rudd and Fox) and the film's comedic moments and perceptive scenes, but criticized its overlong running time and occasional aimlessness. In March 2022, Apatow was announced to be in early development of a third film, set 10 years later and titled ''This Is 50''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the five years since ''[[Knocked Up]]'', Debbie owns a [[boutique]] and Desi and Jodi work for her. Pete owns his own [[record label]], and friends Ronnie and Cat work with him.\n\nPete's business is struggling financially as he promotes the reunion of [[Graham Parker & The Rumour]]. The couple also are having to deal with their daughters; Thirteen-year-old Sadie and eight-year-old Charlotte. For Debbie's 40th birthday, the couple goes on a romantic weekend to a resort. There they get high on [[cannabis foods|marijuana cookies]], and fantasize out loud about ways they would kill each other.\n\nAfter speaking with her friends Jason and Barb, Debbie decides to improve her marriage and family through exercise and becoming more connected with her father. She tells Pete he needs to stop lending his dad Larry money because it is hurting them financially. Pete visits him, but is unsuccessful at giving him the news, and still agrees to give him more. Meanwhile, Debbie visits her gynecologist, discovering she is pregnant but decides not to tell Pete. Later, she yells at a student, Joseph, who has been taunting Sadie on [[Facebook]]. So much so that his mother, Catherine, gets into an argument with Pete.\n\nOne night between the school taunting sequences, Debbie takes Desi out dancing at a club, planning to confront her with her suspicions that she has been stealing money from the store. Debbie and Desi meet several players from the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] hockey team there. Debbie awkwardly finds out that one of the players wants to hang out with her and possibly sleep with her. Proud that he wants to have sex with her, but she admits that she is married, has two kids, and is pregnant. Afterward, Debbie drops Desi off at her house, finally confronting her about the missing money. Desi reveals she is able to afford nice things because she is also an [[Call girl|escort]].\n\nLater, Debbie meets up with Jodi, who confesses she stole the money to buy [[Oxycontin]]. She fires her and leaves. Meanwhile, Pete and Debbie are having to deal with Sadie and Charlotte fighting all the time, resulting in arguments among the family. They later have to meet with the principal, but the couple denies everything Catherine accuses them of doing. The couple is delighted when she starts using the same foul language they had used previously, and the principal dismisses them.\n\nAt Pete's 40th birthday party, they argue about the money his dad wants from them. Debbie argues with her dad about not spending enough time in her life, and how he is perfect. Oliver then explains that his life is not perfect, and how he has always cared about her and loved her. Later, Pete overhears Debbie talking about her pregnancy, and rides out of the house on his bicycle in anger. Debbie and Larry go, finding he has cycled into a car door. Pete gets into an argument with the driver of the car, who then punches him in the stomach.\n\nDebbie and Larry take Pete to the hospital, where Larry and Debbie reconcile, with Larry recognizing that she is why the family is able to stay together, as she is the fighter. Pete and Debbie talk later; he is actually thrilled about having a third baby, he doesn't feel trapped, so they reconcile.\n\nSometime later, Pete and Debbie are watching a small concert with [[Ryan Adams]] performing. She suggests he sign him to his label and they plan to talk to him as they finish watching the show.<ref name=\"lacma\">{{cite web | title= Judd Apatow shows 'This Is 40' to appreciative LACMA audience| url= https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-judd-apatow-this-is-40-lacma-20121102,0,3187528.story | date= November 2, 2012 |first= Mark |last= Olsen | newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] | access-date=2012-11-06}}</ref>\n\nAfter the main credits roll, there's an extended alternate take of Catherine's [[ad-libbing]] insults during the meeting with Debbie, Pete, and the school principal.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as Pete, Debbie's husband and a record label owner\n* [[Leslie Mann]] as Debbie, Pete's wife and a shop owner\n* [[Maude Apatow]] as Sadie, their 13-year-old daughter\n* [[Iris Apatow]] as Charlotte, their 8-year-old daughter\n* [[Jason Segel]] as Jason, Debbie's trainer\n* [[Charlyne Yi]] as Jodi, one of Debbie's employees\n* [[Tim Bagley]] as Dr. Pellegrino, Debbie's gynecologist\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Oliver, Debbie's father\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Larry, Pete's father\n* [[Megan Fox]] as Desi, one of Debbie's employees\n* [[Chris O'Dowd]] as Ronnie, one of Pete's employees\n* [[Melissa McCarthy]] as Catherine\n* [[Ryan Lee (actor)|Ryan Lee]] as Joseph\n* [[Lena Dunham]] as Cat, one of Pete's employees\n* [[Robert Smigel]] as Barry, Pete's friend\n* [[Annie Mumolo]] as Barb, Debbie's friend\n* [[Joanne Baron]] as Mrs. Laviati\n* Ava Sambora as Wendy, Sadie's best friend\n* [[Michael Ian Black]] as Bank Consultant \n* [[Bill Hader]] as Desi's hook up customer (un-credited)\n* [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] as himself\n* [[Graham Parker]] as himself\n* [[Ryan Adams]] as himself\n* [[Tom Freund]] as himself\n* [[Bob Andrews (keyboardist)|Bob Andrews]] as himself\n* [[Brinsley Schwarz (musician)|Brinsley Schwarz]] as himself\n* [[Martin Belmont]] as himself\n* [[Andrew Bodnar]] as himself\n* [[Steve Goulding]] as himself\n}}\n\n'''Cameos'''\n* [[Scott Hartnell]]\n* [[Ian Laperriere]]\n* [[James van Riemsdyk]]\n* [[Matt Carle]]\n\n==Release==\n''This Is 40'' was originally scheduled to be released on June 1, 2012.

Cheers as well to a terrific supporting cast, including [[Melissa McCarthy]] as a mother from hell, [[John Lithgow]] as Debbie's withdrawn father, and the priceless Albert Brooks as Pete's dad, living off his son's dole to support his tow-headed triplets. ''This Is 40'' doesn't build to a catharsis. It sometimes dawdles as it circles the spectacle of a marriage in flux. Yet Pete and Debbie's sparring yields some of Apatow's most personal observations yet on the feelings for husbands, wives, parents, and children that we categorize as love.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Peter |last=Travers |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/this-is-40-20121218 |title=This Is 40 &#124; Movie Reviews |newspaper=Rolling Stone |date=December 18, 2012 |access-date=November 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' said \"More like ''This Is Whiny''\", giving the film two and a half stars out of four. \"''This Is 40'' has its share of clever, zingy material, proving that writer-director Judd Apatow has lost none of his ability to land a punch line with the right, unexpected turn of phrase. 'My boobs are just ... gone,' bemoans Debbie, played by Leslie Mann, comparing hers with those of her employee, played by [[Megan Fox]]. Then comes the second line, building smartly on the setup: 'They didn't even say goodbye.' Mann is wonderful, a uniquely skillful comic and dramatic actor\u2014wide-eyed yet merrily devastating when the venom's called for. Rudd can get away with murder on sheer charm. But it's easy, and sort of lazy, to establish jokes and entire scenes built upon mocking somebody's dialect, or the older daughter's obsession with ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-1218-this-is-40-20121220-column.html |title=Judd Apatow misses chance to go deeper with 'This Is 40' \u2605\u2605 1/2 |first=Michael |last=Phillips |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=December 20, 2012 |access-date=December 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Richard Roeper]] gave the film a C- and called the film \"a huge disappointment\".
