The film received generally positive reviews.\n\n==Plot summary==\nDavid Lurie ([[John Malkovich]]) is an ageing white professor teaching [[Romantic literature]] at an unnamed university in [[Cape Town]] shortly after the end of [[apartheid]]. David has an affair with one of his students, Melanie Isaacs (Antoinette Engel). University officials learn of the incident and bring David before a disciplinary board. David's colleagues offer him a quiet exit to save face, but he brashly affirms his guilt and refuses to admit wrongdoing, forcing the board to punish him more harshly.\n\nDavid takes refuge with his daughter, Lucy ([[Jessica Haines]]), who owns a farm in the [[Eastern Cape]]. At first, the two experience harmony and Lurie finds peace with himself, though he grows suspicious of Lucy's farm manager, Petrus ([[Eriq Ebouaney]]). One day, David and Lucy are attacked by three men, who rape Lucy. David goes through a crisis, not knowing how to cope with his personal and family tragedies. He is also confused by the newfound guilt he suddenly feels about these rapes. In a movement toward penance, David goes back to his former student's home to beg for forgiveness from her and her family.\n\nAfter a brief sojourn in Cape Town, he returns to the farm to find that Lucy is pregnant and that Petrus is steadily increasing his control over the property. One of the rapists has taken up residence with Petrus, and turns out to be his brother-in-law. Despite David's outrage, Lucy insists on not taking the matter to the authorities, and states that she will bear the child. Petrus offers to \"marry\" her and she agrees in order to come under his protection. David must come to terms with the new South Africa.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[John Malkovich]] as David Lurie, a university professor\n*[[Jessica Haines]] as Lucy Lurie, David's daughter, a farmer in the Eastern Cape\n*[[Eriq Ebouaney]] as Petrus, a worker on Lucy's farm\n*[[Fiona Press]] as Bev Shaw, head of an animal refuge\n*[[Antoinette Engel]] as Melanie Isaacs, a university student\n*[[David Dennis (actor)|David Dennis]] as Mr. Isaacs, Melanie's father\n\n==Reception==\nThe film premiered at the 2008 [[Toronto International Film Festival]],<ref name=\"CBC\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/story/2008/07/02/tiff-special.html|title=Disgrace, Miracle at St. Anna to premiere at Toronto film fest|date=2 July 2008|publisher=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=1 August 2009}}</ref> where it was awarded the Prize of the International Critics.<ref name=\"Vancheri\">{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08259/912217-42.stm|title=Awards put the wrap on Toronto Film Festival|last=Vancheri|first=Barbara|date=15 November 2008|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=1 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nIt received generally positive reviews in the media. For example, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' concluded that \"Like the novel, the film goes where it must, not where the dictates of off-the-rack narrative compel it. Jacobs has made some smart choices, including tucking the novel's last scene into the body of the film, lessening its inevitable bathos if taken straight from page to screen. The anguishing confrontations between David and Lucy, David and the family of the woman he has wronged, David and Lucy's neighbors, and ultimately, between David and the reality of a modern South Africa, are as powerful here as in the book.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/01/AR2009100104668.html |title=Movie Review: Film Version of J.M.
