After being out of work because of the [[Great Depression]], Sol applies for work as a lumberjack in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. However, to take the job, he must leave on almost no notice on a company bus.  Unable to find Natty before departing, he leaves her a letter promising to send her the fare to join him as soon as he has earned it. Meanwhile, he makes arrangements with Connie, the shallow and insensitive innkeeper of their rooming-house, so Natty can stay on under Connie's temporary supervision.\n\nAfter overhearing Connie reporting her as an abandoned child, Natty runs away to find her father on her own, embarking on a cross-country journey riding the rails along with other penniless travelers and [[hobos]]. Along the way she saves a [[wolfdog]] from a dog fighting ring. In return the dog, whom she calls Wolf, becomes her friend and protector in her attempt to return to her father. She has a brief, innocent romance with another young traveler, Harry, and encounters various obstacles that test her courage, perseverance, and ingenuity, such as being arrested after [[cattle rustling]] and remanded to a juvenile facility. Natty manages to escape the detention center and confronts the blacksmith who has been given control of the captured Wolf. The blacksmith turns out to be kind and fair-minded; he releases Wolf to Natty, and gives her food, a ride to a train station and enough money for a ticket. She is cheated of her ticket money by an unscrupulous ticket agent, and narrowly escapes his attempt to turn her in, returning to \"riding the rails\" illicitly on freight trains, where she is unexpectedly reunited with Harry in a rail-side shantytown.\n\nWhen Natty's father calls Connie, she tells him Natty is gone. In a later phone call, he is grieved to learn that Natty's wallet was found underneath a derailed freight train \u2014 unbeknownst to him, she survived the crash. He is given a week's leave from the lumber company to search through the wreckage for her, but to no avail. He returns to the [[lumber camp]] and requests the most dangerous jobs, known as \"widow's work\", now that he seems to have little to live for.\n\nArriving on the west coast, Natty's journey takes several more challenging turns. Harry finds work through the federal [[Works Progress Administration]] in San Francisco, but she declines his invitation to go with him, preferring to find her father. The logging operation does not list Sol Gann among their workers, but Natty is undeterred, searching fruitlessly for him by showing other loggers his photo in a pendant he has given her which is her last trace of her parents. Wolf hears the calls of other wolves nearby, and Natty tearfully tells him to go join his own kind. The company clerk catches her in one of the backwoods camps and makes arrangements for her to be sent back down the mountain for her own safety. The clerk then unexpectedly finds the returned letter her father had sent enclosing her train ticket to rejoin him and tells Natty of his location. Natty sets out on foot and sees a company truck pass by loaded with injured men. In the truck, she glimpses her father. She runs after it, calling out for him, but is eventually devastated when it outpaces her. She hears his voice call out for her and finds him standing in the road.  They share an emotional embrace, with Wolf looking on from a nearby cliff.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Meredith Salenger]] as Natty Gann\n* [[Jed (wolfdog)|Jed the Wolfdog]] as Wolf\n* [[John Cusack]] as Harry\n* [[Ray Wise]] as Sol Gann\n* [[Lainie Kazan]] as Connie\n* [[Scatman Crothers]] as Sherman\n* [[Barry Miller (actor)|Barry Miller]] as Parker\n* [[Verna Bloom]] as Farm Woman\n* [[John Finnegan (actor)|John Finnegan]] as Logging Boss\n* [[Garry Chalk (actor)|Garry Chalk]] as Chicago Worker\n* [[Frank C.
