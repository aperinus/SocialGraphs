Inspired by the films ''[[Sherlock Jr.]]'' (1924) and ''[[Hellzapoppin' (film)|Hellzapoppin']]'' (1941) and [[Luigi Pirandello|Pirandello]]'s play ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'', it is the tale of a film character named Tom Baxter who leaves a fictional film of the same name and enters the real world.\n\nThe film was released on March 1, 1985. It won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film]], while Allen received several screenwriting nominations, including at the [[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay|Academy Awards]], the [[BAFTA Awards]], and the [[Writers Guild of America Awards]]. Allen has ranked it among his best films, along with ''[[Husbands and Wives]]'' (1992) and ''[[Match Point]]'' (2005).<ref>{{cite book |first=Eric |last=Lax |author-link=Eric Lax |url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00laxe/page/360/mode/2up |title=Conversations with Woody Allen |location=New York |publisher=[[Alfred A.

It is the story of a rich Manhattan playwright named Henry who goes on an exotic vacation to Egypt with companions Jason and Rita. While in Egypt, the three meet archaeologist Tom Baxter. Tom is brought back for a \"madcap Manhattan weekend\" where he falls head-over-heels for Kitty Haynes, a [[chanteuse]] at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]].\n\nAfter Cecilia sits through the film several times, Tom, noticing her, breaks the [[fourth wall]], and emerges from the inner film's [[black-and-white]] world into the full-color real world on the other side of the cinema screen. He tells Cecilia that he is attracted to her after noticing her watching him so many times, and she takes him around her New Jersey town. Later, he takes her into the film and they have a great evening in the town within the film. The two fall in love. But between these two events, the character's defection from the film has caused some problems. In other copies of the film, others have tried to exit the screen. The producer of the film learns that Tom has left the film, and he flies cross-country to [[New Jersey]] with actor Gil Shepherd (the \"real life\" actor playing the part of Tom in the movie). This sets up an unusual [[love triangle]] involving Tom, Gil, and Cecilia. Cecilia must choose between them and she decides to choose the real person of Gil rather than the fantasy figure of Tom. She gives up the chance to return with Tom to his world, choosing to stay with Gil and have a \"real\" life. Then she finally leaves her husband.\n\nBut Gil's professions of love for Cecilia were false\u2014he wooed her only to get Tom to return to the movie and thereby save his own Hollywood career. Gil abandons Cecilia and is seen quietly racked with guilt on his flight back to Hollywood. Having been left without a lover, job, or home, Cecilia ends up immersing herself in the frothy escapism of Hollywood once again by going to the movies. Cecilla sits by herself in the theater watching [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] dance to \"[[Cheek to Cheek]]\" in ''[[Top Hat]]'', ultimately losing herself in the charm of the film.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Mia Farrow]] as Cecilia\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Tom Baxter / Gil Shepherd\n* [[Danny Aiello]] as Monk\n* [[Edward Herrmann]] as Henry\n* [[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]] as Jason\n* [[Deborah Rush]] as Rita\n* [[Zoe Caldwell]] as the Countess\n* [[Van Johnson]] as Larry Wilde\n* [[Karen Akers]] as Kitty Haynes\n* [[Milo O'Shea]] as Father Donnelly\n* [[Dianne Wiest]] as Emma\n* [[Paul Herman]] as The Penny Pitcher\n* [[Michael Tucker (actor)|Michael Tucker]] as Gil's agent\n* [[Glenne Headly]] as hooker in bordello\n* [[Juliana Donald]] as usherette\n* [[George Martin (American actor)|George Martin]] as member of movie audience\n* [[Loretta Tupper]] as music shop owner<ref>{{cite book|last=Milne|first=Jeff|title=Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon: The Complete Guide to the Movie Trivia Game|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZyqXZ_3sEwC&pg=PT224|publisher=Jeff Milne|year=2009|page=224|isbn=978-0-6152-8521-4}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[Michael Keaton]] was originally cast as Tom Baxter/Gil Shepherd, as Allen was a fan of his work. Allen later felt that Keaton, who took a pay cut to work with the director, was too contemporary and hard to accept in the period role.

Store fronts had false facades reflecting the depression-era setting. It was also filmed at the Raritan Diner in [[South Amboy, New Jersey]]. [[Woody Allen]] shut down the Kent Theater on [[Coney Island Avenue]] in Brooklyn, the neighborhood he grew up in, to film there.\n\nIn a rare public appearance at the [[National Film Theatre]] in 2001, Woody Allen listed ''The Purple Rose of Cairo'' as one of only a few of his films that ended up being \"fairly close to what I wanted to do\" when he set out to write it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,562687,00.html |title=The Guardian/NFT interview: Woody Allen (II) |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 27, 2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624073552/http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,562687,00.html |archive-date=June 24, 2006}} from ''[[The Guardian|The Guardian Unlimited]]''</ref> Allen provided more detail about the film's origins in a comment he made a year earlier, during a [[press junket]] for ''[[Small Time Crooks]]'':\n\n{{blockquote|''Purple Rose'' was a film that I just locked myself in a room [to write]....
