Verona]]. The film stars [[Perry King]], [[Sylvester Stallone]], Paul Mace and [[Henry Winkler]]. Stallone was also credited with writing additional dialogue. The plot is about street teenagers in [[Greaser (subculture)|leather jacket]]s from the [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thenewbev.com/blog/2019/01/the-lords-of-flatbush/ |title=The Lords of Flatbush |first=Quentin |last=Tarantino |author-link=Quentin Tarantino |publisher=[[New Beverly Cinema]] |date=2019-01-07 |access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> The movie, along with the television hit ''[[Happy Days]]'', ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' in its Broadway and film versions was part of a resurgence in popular interest in the '50s greaser culture in the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Prigge |first=Matthew J.

The Lords chase girls, steal cars, shoot pool, get into street fights, and hang out at a local malt shop. Chico attempts to win over hard-to-get, [[waspy]] Jane while throwing over easier-to-get Annie. Stanley seemingly impregnates his girlfriend Frannie, who pressures him to marry her. Stanley eventually agrees to marry even after finding out before the wedding that Frannie was never pregnant. Butchey Weinstein is highly intelligent but hides his brains behind a clownish front in order to fit in with the gang. Wimpy Murgalo is a loyal follower in awe of Stanley, eventually becoming best man at his wedding. All four boys seem to discover maturity and responsibility at the end of the film as we witness them bonding during the wedding in their dress suits, eschewing their typical leather jackets.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast per opening tombstone credits, order and roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Perry King]] as Chico Tyrell\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as Stanley Rosiello\n* [[Henry Winkler]] as Butchey Weinstein\n* Paul Mace as Wimpy Murgalo\n* [[Susan Blakely]] as Jane Bradshaw\n* Maria Smith as Frannie Malincanico\n* Rene\u00e9 Paris as Annie Yuckamanelli\n}}\n\nIn addition, other notable names amongst the supporting and background performers include co-director [[Martin Davidson]] in a cameo as Mr. Birnbaum, future [[Academy Award for Best Original Song#1970s|Academy Award]]\u2013winner and [[disco]] superstar [[Paul Jabara]] as Crazy Cohen, future [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy#1980s|Golden Globe]]\u2013winner [[Ray Sharkey]] as a random student and future [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie#1990s|Emmy Award]]\u2013winner [[Armand Assante]] as an anonymous wedding guest.\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\n[[Richard Gere]] was originally cast as Chico but was fired due to conflicts with Stallone during rehearsals. In a 2006 interview Stallone explained:\n\n{{blockquote|We never hit it off. He would strut around in his oversized motorcycle jacket like he was the baddest knight at the round table. One day, during an improv, he grabbed me (we were simulating a fight scene) and got a little carried away. I told him in a gentle fashion to lighten up, but he was completely in character and impossible to deal with. Then we were rehearsing at [[Coney Island]] and it was lunchtime, so we decided to take a break, and the only place that was warm was in the backseat of a [[Toyota]]. I was eating a hotdog and he climbs in with a half a chicken covered in [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]] with grease nearly dripping out of the aluminum wrapper. I said, \"That thing is going to drip all over the place.\" He said, \"Don't worry about it.\" I said, \"If it gets on my pants you're gonna know about it.\" He proceeds to bite into the chicken and a small, greasy river of mustard lands on my thigh. I elbowed him in the side of the head and basically pushed him out of the car. The director had to make a choice: one of us had to go, one of us had to stay. Richard was given his walking papers and to this day seriously dislikes me.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30932 |publisher= [[Ain't It Cool News]] |title= Stallone answers December 9th & 10th Questions in a double round - plus Harry's Seen ROCKY BALBOA at BNAT!!! |first= Harry |last= Knowles |author-link= Harry Knowles |date= 2006-12-16 |access-date= 2020-03-12 }}</ref>}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 64% based on reviews from 14 critics.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lords_of_flatbush |title= The Lords of Flatbush (1974) |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date= February 16, 2022 }}</ref>\nOn [[Metacritic]] it has a score of 53 out of 100 based on reviews from 6 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Lords of Flatbush |url= https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lords-of-flatbush |website= [[Metacritic]] |access-date= May 10, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n[[Quentin Tarantino]] calls it \"a pretty good film...the first time I was introduced to the New York [[Independent film|independent]] [[low-budget film]] aesthetic.\"<ref>{{Cite web |website= New Beverly |first= Quentin |last= Tarantino |date= 22 December 2019 |url= http://thenewbev.com/tarantinos-reviews/the-lords-of-flatbush/ |title= The Lords of Flatbush }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Greaser (subculture)]]\n* ''[[Happy Days]]''\n* [[List of American films of 1974]]\n* ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (movie)\n* ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' (play and musical)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AFI film}}\n* {{Mojo title}}\n\n{{Sylvester Stallone}}\n{{Martin Davidson}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lords of Flatbush, The}}\n[[Category:1974 films]]\n[[Category:1970s coming-of-age comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American gang films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Martin Davidson]]\n[[Category:Films set in Brooklyn]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1950s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1958]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:1974 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1970s gang films]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]"}]}}}}
