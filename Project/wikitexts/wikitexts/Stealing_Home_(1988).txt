The film stars [[Mark Harmon]], [[Blair Brown]], [[Jonathan Silverman]], [[Harold Ramis]], [[William McNamara]], and [[Jodie Foster]]. The movie focuses on a failed baseball player, Billy Wyatt, who discovers that his childhood sweetheart, Katie Chandler, has died by suicide. Billy must confront the past via reminiscence and nostalgia, while also dealing with grief, as he embarks on a journey to fulfill one of Katie's last wishes; that he spread her ashes.\n\n''Stealing Home'' was released theatrically on August 26, 1988 by [[Warner Bros.]] Upon release the film was a critical and commercial failure, although [[David Foster]]'s musical score garnered universal praise. Since its release, with [[Rerun|television reruns]], and [[DVD]] releases, the film has attained [[cult classic]] status, praised by audiences for its melancholic and nostalgic themes, performances, and musical score.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 1980s, Billy Wyatt is a thirty-something washed up baseball player living out of a hotel with a cocktail waitress. One afternoon he receives a phone call from his mother, telling him his close childhood friend Katie Chandler has died by suicide.\n\nFlashbacks to the '60s show Billy and Katie's relationship. She was a slightly older neighborhood girl who babysat him for the Wyatts, who were best friends with the Chandlers. Katie mentors young Billy, giving him advice on girls and dating. As he ages he begins to develop feelings for her, and she reciprocates.\n\nJust after Billy graduates high school, his father Sam dies in a car accident. Two months later Katie, Billy, Ginny, and Billy's friend Alan Appleby decide to go back to their summer home \"Seasmoke\" for the summer as they have done every year, the first without Billy's dad. As summer approaches its end, Billy feels Katie is encouraging his mother to live more freely too soon, and he has a shouting match with her.\n\nThe next day at sunrise, Billy goes to Katie for forgiveness, and they spend the rest of the weekend together at Seasmoke. As the weekend draws to a close, Katie asks Billy to pursue his passion for baseball, and to retrieve the baseball necklace pendant from the girl to whom he lost his virginity to just months before. Walking slowly away, she turns and says \"I love you Billy boy\". The older Billy remembers that was the last time he saw her.\n\nIn the present, Katie's father Hank visits the Wyatt family to share the bad news. He recounts how he drove to Seasmoke to check on an upset Katie after her second divorce, and found her body curled up in her bed. \"She looked like a little girl sleeping.\" Katie's wishes are for Billy to be responsible for her ashes, confident he would be the only person to know what to do with them.\n\nBilly reunites with Appleby and they engage in a night of reminiscing and carousing while driving around in Katie's car with her ashes, trying to figure out what to do with them. Suddenly, Billy recalls Katie telling him her fantasy that she could jump off the pier and fly free with the birds. The next morning, Billy goes to the pier, runs down the dock and tosses her ashes just the way she described in her fantasy.\n\nBilly joins a minor league baseball team; taking pride in grooming the field each morning before a game. The film ends with Billy, his girlfriend, and Appleby celebrating after a game that he won by \"stealing home\" (the same thing he did in the last game he played the day his father died).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mark Harmon]] as Billy Wyatt\n** [[William McNamara]] as young Billy Wyatt\n** Thacher Goodwin as Billy Wyatt (age 10)\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as Alan Appleby\n** [[Jonathan Silverman]] as young Alan Appleby\n* [[Blair Brown]] as Ginny Wyatt\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Hank Chandler\n* [[John Shea]] as Sam Wyatt\n* [[Christine Jones (actress)|Christine Jones]] as Grace Chandler\n* [[Ted Ross]] as Bud Scott\n* [[Helen Hunt]] as Hope Wyatt\n* [[Beth Broderick]] as Leslie\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Katie Chandler\n\n== Production ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nThe film plot is set in the [[Philadelphia]] area and the [[New Jersey]] shore.

''Stealing Home'' was greenlit shortly after Raucher denied their latest attempt to purchase the rights, leading to ''Summer'' star [[Jennifer O'Neill]]'s assertion that ''Stealing Home'' was \"stolen\" from ''Summer''. Regardless, she said that she enjoyed the film and called it a \"lovely film.\"<ref name=jenn2>[http://www.tv-now.com/intervus/oneill/index.html Jennifer O'Neill in 2002] ''tv-now.com'' Retrieved August 11, 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829114811/http://www.tv-now.com/intervus/oneill/index.html |date=August 29, 2006 }}</ref> Rita Kempley, in her review for the ''[[Washington Post]],'' also saw similarities with ''Summer'', describing the film as a \"pale comedy-drama by mediocrities Steven Kampmann and Will Aldis.
