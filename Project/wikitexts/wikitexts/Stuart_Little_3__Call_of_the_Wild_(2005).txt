In the film, Stuart and his family spend their summer vacation in a cabin near Lake Garland. During the vacation, Stuart befriends a skunk named Reeko, and the family cat Snowbell is kidnapped by a mysterious beast.\n\nA majority of the cast from the previous installments returned for the film such as [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Geena Davis]] and [[Hugh Laurie]] reprising their roles as Stuart Little, Eleanor Little and Frederick Little, but Snowbell, George and Monty are now voiced by [[Kevin Schon]], Corey Padnos and [[Rino Romano]] instead of [[Nathan Lane]], [[Jonathan Lipnicki]] and [[Steve Zahn]] who previously portrayed and voiced them in the live-action films.<ref>{{Citation|title=Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472602/|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=October 2022}}\n{{long plot|date=October 2022}}\nThree years after the events of the [[Stuart Little 2|previous film]], Stuart, Snowbell, and the Littles leave [[New York City]] to go on a camping trip near Lake Garland. Once they arrive, Stuart and his brother George decide to join a group called the \"Lake Scouts\" led by their leader Troopmaster Bickle, with their father Frederick watching over them.\n\nAlthough George is shown to be skilled at scouting while also developing a crush on a female Scout named Brooke, Stuart has trouble keeping up with the Lake Scouts due to his small stature. He soon encounters Reeko, a comedic, smooth-talking [[skunk]] who is generally disliked by the local forest animals of Lake Garland because of his attitude, and is secretly on a mission to give food to his master \"The Beast\", a ruthless female [[mountain lion]] who is feared by the animals because she forces them to steal and bring food to her every night. Meanwhile, Snowbell discovers that his alley cat friend Monty is living under the Littles' cabin, revealing he had stowed away by sneaking into the trunk of their car unnoticed.\n\nDown on his luck with the Scouts and with Troopmaster Bickle looking down upon him, Stuart makes a deal with Reeko that he will help Stuart learn the ways of the forest. That evening, after being invited to dinner with Stuart's family, Reeko ultimately befriends Stuart. However, upon leaving the Littles' cabin, Reeko, deciding that the food given to the Beast isn't enough, finds Snowbell and tricks him into thinking that there is a \"party\" in the forest, prompting Snowbell to enter the woods that night, only for him to end up getting captured by the Beast. Soon after witnessing Snowbell's kidnapping, Stuart attempts to tell his family and the Scouts the truth about his friend getting captured the next day, but they all refuse to believe him as they think Stuart was just dreaming the whole time.\n\nWith no choice, Stuart goes off to rescue his friend alone, but learns along the way that Reeko was in cahoots with the Beast and responsible for Snowbell's disappearance the previous night. Meanwhile, Snowbell is taken to the Beast's cave. The Beast only refuses to eat him when Snowbell suggests that she fatten him up first in order to have a rug made out of Snowbell's fur for the winter. Shortly afterward, Stuart's mother Eleanor realizes that Stuart is missing upon finding a note left by him and rallies a search party with Frederick and the Scouts.\n\nMeanwhile, Stuart reaches the Beast's cave, where he is able to sneak past the Beast and manages to rescue Snowbell, who was trapped in a pit. On their way out of the cave, Stuart and Snowbell find themselves cornered by the Beast, whom Stuart overwhelms with salt and pepper before he and Snowbell escape and build a trap covered with leaves and sticks, trying to force the Beast to fall through it just as she catches up to them.\n\nHowever, after discovering the trap and then attempting to devour Stuart, the Beast is confronted by Reeko, who, having realized the error of his ways, shows up along with the forest animals, who have decided to support him upon having a change of heart. Reeko incapacitates the Beast by spraying at her, allowing the forest animals to distract her long enough for Stuart and Snowbell to lure her into their trap, whereupon she falls through it and is finally captured. Later that night, Stuart and Snowbell are found by the Littles and the Scouts, where Stuart shows them the Beast, proving that she was actually real all along.\n\nThe next day, while the Beast is taken away to a [[zoo]], Stuart earns a gold kerchief from Troopmaster Bickle. As Stuart's family is preparing to leave Lake Garland, George gives his game console to Brooke as well as a list of his personal particulars (in case she needs help while playing on his game console, she can call, text or email him). Grateful, Brooke in return kisses him on the cheek. Reeko apologizes to Stuart for his behavior, telling Stuart that he was wrong to betray him. Stuart then bids farewell to Reeko before he, Snowbell, Monty and the Littles return home to New York City.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{main|List of Stuart Little characters}}\n*[[Michael J.

James Plath of ''Reels.com'' rated it 2.5 out of 4, saying \"Kids will still like it because the storyline is engaging, the color palette is bright and cheery, the songs are upbeat and pleasant enough, and the messages about good behavior, perseverance, and belonging are worthwhile.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stuart_little_3_call_of_the_wild/reviews/|title=Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild - Movie Reviews|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref> Sloan Freer of ''Radiotimes.com'' rated it 2 out of 5, saying, \"The quality plunges drastically in this uninspired direct-to-video sequel. Gone is the charming mix of live action and CGI used in the original two films, replaced by full animation whose flatness and simplicity is symbolic of the entire tale. Surprisingly, the core voice talent remains the same with Michael J Fox, Geena Davis, and Hugh Laurie wasting their efforts on a weak plot that sees boy mouse Stuart demonstrate his bravery when Snowbell the family cat is kidnapped during the Little clan's lakeside vacation. Undemanding humour, a sprinkling of mild peril, and the obligatory life lessons offer enough substance to keep the very young happy, but only the short running time will impress anyone older.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/cfbfh/stuart-little-3-call-of-the-wild|title=Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild \u2013 review - cast and crew, movie star rating and where to watch film on TV and online|website=Radio Times}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD.
