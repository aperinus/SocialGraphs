The musical score of ''Kansas City'' is integrated into the film, with modern-day musicians recreating the [[Kansas City jazz]] of 1930s.\n\nThe film was entered into the [[1996 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4688/year/1996.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Kansas City |access-date=2009-09-16|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA kidnapping goes down in 1934 Kansas City. Blondie O'Hara's (Leigh) petty thief husband Johnny is taken by gangster \"Seldom Seen\" and held prisoner at the Hey Hey Club, one of the hot spots of the [[Kansas City jazz]] scene. Blondie herself kidnaps the wife of a local politician, Mrs. Stilton, who is addicted to [[laudanum]] (an opium liquid) and has secrets of her own. Blondie's plan is to blackmail Mr. Stilton into helping to free Johnny.\n\nDespite the risk to his re-election campaign, Mr. Stilton does everything he can in order to free his wife by saving Johnny, including using his connections to the [[Tom Pendergast]] political machine. Meanwhile, Mrs. Stilton comes to befriend Blondie. She is impressed by Blondie's devotion to her husband, contrasted to her own loveless marriage.\n\nA subplot concerns political fixer Johnny Flynn (Buscemi) paying vagrants and addicts to vote in the upcoming election and sway the outcome.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Blondie O'Hara\n* [[Miranda Richardson]] as Carolyn Stilton\n* [[Harry Belafonte]] as Seldom Seen\n* [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] as Henry Stilton\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Johnny Flynn\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as Johnny O'Hara\n* [[Brooke Smith (actress)|Brooke Smith]] as Babe Flynn\n* [[Jane Adams (actress, born 1965)|Jane Adams]] as Nettie Bolt\n* Martin Martin as 'Blue' Green\n* Frederick Louis Richardson as club dancer (extra)\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Kansas City'' received mixed to positive reviews from critics, as it holds a 60% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 40 reviews. [[Roger Ebert]] gave it three stars for Altman's \"originality and invention\", saying the story is \"fairly thin\" but \"Altman gathered some of the best living jazz musicians, put them on a set representing the Hey Hey Club, and asked them to play period material in the style of the [[Kansas City jazz]] giants ([[Count Basie]], [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Jay McShann]], [[Lester Young]], etc.). He filmed their work in a concert documentary style, and intercuts it\". He praised the period recreation of colors and looks of the clothes, cars, and advertising and was reminded of Altman's other 1930s gangster movie, ''[[Thieves Like Us (film)|Thieves Like Us]]'' (1974).<ref name=\"KC Ebert\">{{cite web | title=Kansas City | date=August 16, 1996 | first=Roger | last=Ebert | url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/kansas-city-1996 | access-date=July 31, 2020}}</ref>\nHarry Belafonte won the New York Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref Name=AM1>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=mw0000184509|label=Review |first=Scott |last=Yanow |access-date=14 March 2020 }}</ref>\n}}\nThe soundtrack was produced by [[Hal Willner]] and [[Steven Bernstein (musician)|Steven Bernstein]] and featured several contemporary musicians playing the roles of jazz musicians from the 1930s.
