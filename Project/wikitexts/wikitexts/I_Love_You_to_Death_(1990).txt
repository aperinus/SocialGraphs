Their marriage seems a typical one until Rosalie discovers that Joey is a womanizer and has been cheating on her for years with multiple women.\n\nRosalie does not want to allow Joey the pleasure of having every woman he wants, so she refuses divorce. Taking extreme measures, she enlists the help of her mother and her young co-worker Devo, who is secretly in love with her, to kill Joey. They hire two incompetent, perpetually stoned men, cousins Harlan and Marlon James.\n\nTo her surprise, Joey proves impossible to kill. Even though Rosalie heavily doses Joey with sleeping pills, he simply gets a stomach cramp, and dismisses it as a virus. They then ask Devo to come over and shoot Joey, but Devo looks away and only ends up wounding Joey behind the ear. When Marlon's cowardice stops him from being present at Joey's murder, Harlan shoots Joey through the chest, but missing his heart.\n\nEventually a convict at the local commissary reveals their plan, and when the police arrive they find the wounded Joey in some pain. He is taken to the hospital, and Rosalie, her mother, Devo, and the James cousins are arrested. Seeing the error of his ways and at his mother's behest, Joey refuses to press charges and bails everyone out of jail. As he waits for Rosalie with flowers and a box of chocolates, he meets the James cousins and makes peace. Seeing Rosalie again, he asks her to take him back, but still offended, she runs out. Joey catches her and in the janitors' closet they reveal their love with some intimacy, much to Devo's dismay and the surprise of Rosalie's mother.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kevin Kline]] as Joey Boca\n* [[Tracey Ullman]] as Rosalie Boca\n* [[Joan Plowright]] as Nadja\n* [[River Phoenix]] as Devo Nod\n* [[William Hurt]] as Harlan James\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Marlon James\n* [[James Gammon]] as Lieutenant Larry Schooner\n* [[Jack Kehler]] as Sergeant Carlos Wiley\n* [[Victoria Jackson]] as Lacey\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Mrs. Boca\n* [[Alisan Porter]] as Carla Boca\n* [[Jon Kasdan]] as Dominic Boca\n* [[Heather Graham]] as Bridget\n* [[Phoebe Cates]] as Joey's disco girl (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film earned $4 million on its opening weekend and grossed over $16 million in North America.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=iloveyoutodeath.htm | title=I Love You to Death (1990) | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | access-date=15 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= 'Turtles' Take: $50.9 Million in Two Weeks : Box office: The kids movie featuring the wise-cracking quartet of terrapins is close to setting a record for an independent film.|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1990-04-10|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-10/entertainment/ca-995_1_box-office|access-date=15 February 2016|first=Pat H.|last=Broeske}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''I Love You to Death'' received mixed reviews. \nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it has a {{RT data|score}} approval rating based on {{RT data|count}} reviews, with an average score of {{RT data|average}}.
