The screenplay by Carol Doyle and [[Mary Agnes Donoghue]] focuses on [[Irish people|Irish]] [[journalist]] [[Veronica Guerin]], whose investigation into the drug trade in [[Dublin]] led to her murder in 1996, at the age of 36. The film is the second to be inspired by Guerin's life. Three years earlier, ''[[When the Sky Falls]]'' centred on the same story, although the names of the real-life characters were changed.\n\n==Plot==\nVeronica Guerin, a [[crime]] [[reporter]] for the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'', becomes aware of how much Dublin's [[illegal drug trade]] is encroaching upon the lives of its [[working class]], especially the children, and vows to expose the men responsible.\n\nGuerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and [[John Traynor (criminal)|John Traynor]], a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord [[John Gilligan (Irish criminal)|John Gilligan]]. To steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests [[Gerry Hutch]], a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues Hutch and discovers he is not involved.\n\nAs Guerin nears the truth, she and her family become targets. A bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her. She is then shot in the leg, and her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and is savagely beaten, she becomes more determined to expose him. Rather than press charges, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with the investigation.\n\nOn 26 June 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to parking tickets and speeding penalties that she had ignored. She is given a nominal fine of IR\u00a3100. En route home she calls her mother and then her husband to report the good news. She is speaking to her office while stopped at traffic light on the [[Naas Dual Carriageway]] when two men riding a motorcycle pull up beside her. The driver breaks the window of her car and shoots her six times. The two flee and dispose of the bike and gun in a nearby [[canal]].\n\nGuerin is mourned by her family, friends, associates and the country. Her violent death results in the establishment of the [[Criminal Assets Bureau]], and Gilligan, along with several of his henchmen, are tried and sentenced to lengthy [[prison]] terms. The [[epilogue]] states that \"Veronica Guerin's writing turned the tide in the drug war. Her murder galvanised Ireland into action. Thousands of people took to the streets in weekly anti-drug marches, which drove the dealers out of Dublin and forced the drug barons underground. Within a week of her death, in an emergency session of the [[Oireachtas|Parliament]], the Government altered the [[Constitution of the Republic of Ireland]] to allow the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|High Court]] to freeze the assets of suspected drug barons.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as [[Veronica Guerin]]\n* [[Gerard McSorley]] as [[John Gilligan (Irish criminal)|John Gilligan]]\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as [[John Traynor (criminal)|John Traynor]]\n* [[Brenda Fricker]] as Bernie Guerin\n* Barry Barnes as Graham Turley \n* Simon O'Driscoll as Cathal Turley \n* [[Don Wycherley]] as Chris Mulligan\n* [[Alan Devine]] as [[Gerry Hutch]]\n* Gerry O'Brien as [[Martin Cahill]]\n* Paul Ronan as Jimmy Guerin\n* Danielle Fox Clarke as the Girl Junkie\n* Stephen O'Doherty as Young Junkie\n* [[Laurence Kinlan]] as Young Timmy (junky)\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in Dublin and in [[Naas]] in [[County Kildare]], with some scenes also being shot near [[Newtownmountkennedy]] in [[County Wicklow]].\n\n[[Colin Farrell]] makes an appearance as a heavily tattooed young man Guerin briefly engages in conversation about a soccer match.\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Veronica Guerin'' received mixed reviews from critics. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it has an approval rating of 53% based on 142 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The site's consensus states: \"Cate Blanchett gives another great performance in a movie that doesn't shed much light on its title character.\"<ref name=\"tomatoes\">{{cite web |title= Veronica Guerin |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/veronica_guerin |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref> On the review aggregator website [[Metacritic]], the film had an average score of 55 out of 100, based on 33 reviews from film critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". \n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/veronica_guerin|title=Veronica Guerin|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=June 4, 2021}}</ref>\n\n[[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"a flat-footed, overwrought crusader-against-evil melodrama, in which Ms. Blanchett's formidable gifts as an actress are reduced to a haircut and an accent. Neither Mr. Schumacher nor Jerry Bruckheimer ... is famous for subtlety, and you expect a movie like this to sacrifice a measure of nuance to be appropriately rousing and emphatic. But the filmmakers have succeeded in making Guerin's fascinating story tedious and formulaic, and in making a real-life drama seem as phony as mediocre television ... [T]he storytelling is so clumsy that very little intrigue develops. Nor does much genuine emotion, a defect that Mr. Schumacher tries to overcome with clever editing and loud, swelling music. ''Veronica Guerin'' is disappointing in its lazy glibness; it wastes a somber and heroic story that could have made a fine movie.\"<ref>{{cite news |author= A. O.

I have a sneaky suspicion that director Joel Schumacher and his writers ... think of this as a story of courage and determination, but what I came away with was a story of bone-headed egocentrism ... The film ends with the obligatory public funeral, grateful proles lining the streets while type crawls up the screen telling how much Guerin's anti-drug crusade accomplished. These are standard prompts for us to get a little weepy at the heroism of this brave martyr, but actually I think Blanchett and Schumacher have found the right note for their story.\"<ref>{{cite news |date= 2003-10-17 |author= Roger Ebert |author-link= Roger Ebert |title=Veronica Guerin movie review &amp; film summary (2003) |url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/veronica-guerin-2003 |publisher= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] |access-date= 2019-10-22 }}</ref>\n\n[[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' observed, \"The film's success hinges on its avoidance of clich\u00e9&nbsp;\u2013 including ... the lovable anti-heroine&nbsp;\u2013 and what emerges is an arresting portrait of a fascinating and somewhat mysterious personality. Congratulations to director Joel Schumacher and screenwriter Carol Doyle for not including the typical Hollywood scene, which usually comes right before the climax, in which the protagonist sums up why she's willing to sacrifice all ... Aside from one lapse into sentimentality ... Joel Schumacher has crafted a smart, brisk thriller. More than that, he's given us a compelling character study and a celebration of a kind of modern woman who just did not exist a few generations ago: competent, professional, living on a cell phone, working into the night.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Mick LaSalle, Chronicle Movie Critic |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/10/17/DD248603.DTL |title='&#39;San Francisco Chronicle'&#39; review |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=2003-10-17 |access-date=2012-05-09}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' rated the film two out of four stars and commented, \"Cate Blanchett is the spark that keeps this well-meaning but by-the-numbers biopic going.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Travers |first=Peter |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/veronica-guerin-20031009 |title='&#39;Rolling Stone'&#39; review |publisher= [[Rolling Stone]] |date=October 9, 2013 |access-date=2016-12-24}}</ref>\n\nDerek Elley of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated, \"It's slickly packaged, looks good in widescreen and toplines Cate Blanchett, but producer Jerry Bruckheimer and helmer Joel Schumacher ... seem boxed in by the very recent story and by the challenge of making a driven, rather foolhardy newspaperwoman into a sympathetic figure.

Instead of a genuine tale of courage, folly, and corruption, this is a crude cartoon of good versus evil that includes Blanchett's worst performance and a conclusion that is one of the more repulsive pieces of emotional pornography since Bruckheimer's ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]''.
