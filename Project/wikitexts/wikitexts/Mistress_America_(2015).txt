It was written by Baumbach and [[Greta Gerwig]], and stars Gerwig and [[Lola Kirke]]. The film was released on August 14, 2015, by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nCollege freshman Tracy Fishko is having trouble adjusting to college life at [[Barnard College|Barnard]]. She eventually meets and befriends a fellow student, Tony, and even develops a crush on him, but when he begins dating another girl called Nicolette, she feels alone again. On her mother's advice, she contacts her soon-to-be stepsister Brooke, who also lives in New York.\n\nTracy is immediately entranced by Brooke and her lifestyle. After spending a whirlwind night with her, she pens a short story and submits it to her college's prestigious literary magazine. Tracy continues to spend time with Brooke, who reveals her plans for a small and eclectic restaurant called Mom's after her dead mother; the restaurant is being financed by her partner. Upon returning home one night, however, Brooke finds herself locked out of her apartment and discovers that her boyfriend has withdrawn financial support. With massive bills for the restaurant coming due, Brooke visits a psychic with Tracy. Tracy interprets the psychic's words as meaning that Brooke should ask for the money from her former friend Mamie-Claire, with whom she had a falling-out after Mamie-Claire stole her idea for a business and married her former fianc\u00e9.\n\nTracy has Tony drive her and Brooke to Mamie-Claire's home in Connecticut, with Nicolette joining them to make sure that Tony and Tracy are not having an affair. At Mamie-Claire's home, Brooke and the others crash Mamie-Claire's book party, and Brooke pitches her restaurant to Mamie-Claire, hoping she will invest. Mamie-Claire, who confides to Tracy that she did steal Brooke's T-shirt idea to become rich, insists that she will have to talk to her husband, Dylan. While waiting for Dylan's arrival, Brooke takes a call from her father, who informs her that his wedding with Tracy's mother has been called off. When Dylan comes home, rather than dismiss Brooke, he asks her to pitch her restaurant. Brooke stumbles, but Tracy, still enthused by the project, helps her to pitch it. Dylan tells Brooke he will give her the money but insists that, rather than invest in it, he will give it to her to cover the debt she will have from dissolving the business. Seeing that Tracy is upset by this, and also the toxic effect the offer is immediately having on Dylan and Mamie-Claire's relationship, Brooke ultimately refuses the money. Meanwhile, Nicolette, who witnessed Tracy kissing Tony, confronts Tracy about her short story. The entire party reads it, and Brooke becomes offended by the brutal way in which Tracy characterized her. She informs her that they are no longer about to become sisters, as their parents no longer want to marry, and tells Tracy that she will sue. Upset, Tracy, sitting outside the house, takes a hit on the bong that Tony had earlier fashioned from an apple with her initial emblazoned on it, smoking [[Marijuana|weed]] that he had presumably stolen from Dylan's freezer.\n\nTracy's story is accepted by the university's prestigious literary society, and for a while she joins the group. Still finding herself unable to fit in, she decides to start her own literary club, inviting both Tony and Nicolette to apply for membership.\n\nFinding herself alone on Thanksgiving, Tracy goes to Brooke's old apartment and finds her packing her things, about to move to Los Angeles. She learns that Brooke was able to cover her debts, as Mamie-Claire gave her what would have been her share of money from the T-shirt business. Brooke also tells her that she has passed the [[Scholastic Achievement Test|SAT]] and that she has been accepted into college and is considering going. Tracy invites Brooke to have Thanksgiving dinner with her. The two eat out at a restaurant, as the film concludes with Tracy, as narrator, musing: \"Being a beacon of hope for lesser people is a lonely business.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Greta Gerwig]] as Brooke Cardinas\n* [[Lola Kirke]] as Tracy Fishko\n* [[Heather Lind]] as Mamie-Claire\n* [[Cindy Cheung (actress)|Cindy Cheung]] as Karen\n* [[Jasmine Cephas Jones]] as Nicolette\n* [[Matthew Shear]] as Tony\n* [[Kathryn Erbe]] as Stevie Fishko\n* [[Michael Chernus]] as Dylan\n* [[Rebecca Henderson (actress)|Rebecca Henderson]] as Anna\n* [[Rebecca Naomi Jones]] as Party Hostess\n* [[Mickey Sumner]] as Fake Brooke\n\n==Music==\nThe film's [[Film score|musical score]] was composed by [[Dean Wareham]] and [[Britta Phillips]], who had previously collaborated with Baumbach on ''[[The Squid and the Whale]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/Music/article/dean_wareham_britta_phillips_score_noah_baumbachs_mistress_america|title=Dean Wareham and Britta Phillips Score Noah Baumbach's 'Mistress America'|publisher=Exclaim!|access-date=December 31, 2014}}</ref> A soundtrack album was released on August 14, 2015, by [[Milan Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title='Mistress America' Soundtrack Details|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2015/07/22/mistress-america-soundtrack-details/|website=Film Music Reporter|access-date=July 22, 2015|date=July 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nOn January 9, 2015, [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] acquired worldwide distribution rights for the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/sundance-fox-searchlight-buys-greta-gerwig-comedy-mistress-america-1201398317/|title=Sundance: Fox Searchlight Buys Noah Baumbach Comedy 'Mistress America'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 9, 2015|access-date=January 10, 2015|last=McNary|first=Dave}}</ref> ''Mistress America'' premiered on January 24, 2015, at the [[2015 Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Film Festival]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/mistress-america-image-i-am-michael-images/|title=First Mistress America Image from Noah Baumbach's New Film, Plus Other Sundance 2015 Images|work=Collider|access-date=December 31, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/first-look-noah-baumbachs-mistress-america-starring-greta-gerwig-plot-details-revealed-20141208|title=First Look: Noah Baumbach's 'Mistress America' Starring Greta Gerwig, Plot Details Revealed|author=Kevin Jagernauth|date=8 December 2014|work=The Playlist|access-date=December 31, 2014}}</ref> and was released in the United States on August 14, 2015.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mistressamerica.htm|title=Mistress America (2015)|publisher=Box Office Mojo|access-date=May 9, 2015}}</ref> The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States on December 1, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdsreleasedates.com/movies/7657/mistress-america |title=Mistress America Blu-ray |publisher=dvdsreleasedates.com |access-date=2015-12-16}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received positive reviews from critics.
