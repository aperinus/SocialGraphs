Hubert barely sees his father, and this adds to the animosity between mother and son. One morning, as his mother drives him to school, Hubert starts an argument with her about her applying makeup while driving. The argument ends when Chantale stops the car and tells him to walk to school. At school Hubert claims to his teacher, Ms Cloutier, that his mother is dead. After the teacher finds out that it is a lie, she expresses this lie as \"you killed your mother.\" This inspires Hubert to write an essay for school titled \"I killed my mother.\"\n\nLater in the film, Hubert's friend Antonin is revealed to be his boyfriend, but Hubert has not told his mother, and she finds out from Antonin's mother, who assumed that Chantale already knew. Chantale, to some extent, accepts her son's [[homosexuality]]; however, she appears hurt that he did not tell her. Hubert wants to live in his own apartment and is happy that his mother says it is a good idea, but the next day she has changed her mind and does not allow it, claiming that she thinks he is too young.\n\nTheir relationship continues to deteriorate, and Hubert goes to live with his teacher, pretending to be staying with his boyfriend. Hubert's father invites him over for a visit; however, once there, Richard and Chantale tell Hubert they've decided to send him to a boarding school in [[Coaticook]]. Hubert is deeply angered that his father makes the decision, since Hubert only sees his father at Christmas and Easter.\n\nAt the Catholic boarding school, Hubert meets Eric, with whom he has an affair. Eric invites Hubert to go to a nightclub with the other students, where they kiss and Hubert takes [[Amphetamine|speed]]. He takes the Metro home, wakes his mother, and has an emotional conversation with her. The next morning, she takes Hubert to Antonin's mother's workplace to help drip the walls in paint. He and Antonin finish, and he lays down. Antonin proceeds to lay on top of him and kiss him, and they end up having sex. Hubert, later at home, trashes his mother's bedroom, but he calms down and cleans it up. The two fight and, in the morning, she sends Hubert back to the boarding school.\n\nBack at school, Hubert is beaten by two fellow students. Hubert runs away with the help of Antonin, who has borrowed his mother's car. On the journey, Antonin tells Hubert that he is selfish and only cares about himself, but adds that he loves him. The school's principal calls Chantale to inform her of the developments, revealing the note Hubert left, saying he will be \"In his kingdom\". The principal also begins to lecture Chantale, which causes her to have an angry outburst at him, saying how he thinks he's better than her and how he has no right to judge a single mother. Chantale knows exactly where Hubert's \"kingdom\" is; the house he lived in as a child with both his parents.\n\nIndeed, she finds Hubert and Antonin there. Chantale sits next to Hubert overlooking the beach. The film ends with a home movie clip of Hubert as a child playing with his mother.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Xavier Dolan]] as Hubert Minel\n* [[Anne Dorval]] as Chantale Lemming, Hubert's mother\n* [[Suzanne Cl\u00e9ment]] as Julie Cloutier, Hubert's teacher\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Arnaud (actor)|Fran\u00e7ois Arnaud]] as Antonin Rimbaud, Hubert's boyfriend\n* [[Niels Schneider]] as \u00c9ric, a boy at the boarding school\n* Patricia Tulasne as H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Rimbaud, Antonin's mother\n* Pierre Chagnon as Richard Minel, Hubert's father\n* [[Monique Spaziani]] as Denise, Chantale's friend\n* [[Beno\u00eet Gouin]] as Principal Nadeau, the boarding school principal\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:J'ai tu\u00e9 ma m\u00e8re - TIFF 2009.JPG|thumb|Anne Dorval, Fran\u00e7ois Arnaud, and Xavier Dolan on stage for a Q&A at the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival]].]]\n[[Xavier Dolan]] wrote the script when he was 16 years old.<ref name=\"radiocanada\"/> He said in an interview with Canadian newspaper ''[[Le Soleil (Quebec)|Le Soleil]]'' that the film was partly autobiographical.<ref name=\"lesoleil\"/>\n\nThe film was at first financed by Dolan, but when need for more money arose, he asked both [[Telefilm Canada|T\u00e9l\u00e9film]] and the [[SODEC]] for subsidies.
