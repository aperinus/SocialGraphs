Marks sits next to Jen Summers, in business class, who has switched seats so she can sit by the window. After takeoff, Marks receives a text message on his [[secure phone]] stating that someone will die every 20 minutes unless $150 million is transferred to a specified bank account. Marks breaks protocol and consults Hammond, who dismisses the threat. Marks has Summers and flight attendant Nancy monitor the security cameras while texting the mysterious person to try to identify him.\n\nWhen Hammond is seen using his phone and suddenly goes to the rear coach toilet, Marks confronts him. Hammond tries to bribe Marks, and attacks. Marks secures Hammond in a chokehold, and as Hammond raises a gun, Marks kills him exactly at the 20-minute mark. Marks finds cocaine in his briefcase, and learns the perpetrator had blackmailed him and set him up for death. He alerts the [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]], but TSA Agent Marenick informs him that the bank account is registered in his name and accuses Marks of being the perpetrator. Captain David McMillan dies, apparently poisoned. First Officer Kyle Rice, the co-pilot, convinces Marks that he is innocent.\n\nMarks searches the resentful passengers. One of them uploads a video in which Marks accuses and manhandles schoolteacher Tom Bowen, convincing the rest of the world that Marks is the perpetrator. Kyle is instructed by the TSA to divert to Iceland. Marks persuades programmer Zack White to write a computer virus to make the hijacker's phone ring. The phone rings in passenger Charles Wheeler's suit pocket, but he denies it is his. As Marks roughly questions him, Wheeler suddenly dies, foaming at the mouth. In the first-class lavatory, Marks discovers a hole drilled into the wall that offers a clear shot to the pilot's seat, and discovers a dart in Wheeler's body. A passenger tells him Summers entered the lavatory recently. Marks accuses Summers of being the hijacker. Summers becomes upset, as she had stood by him, and convinces him of her innocence.\n\nTwo [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Eurofighter Typhoon|Typhoon]] fighter jets meet the plane to escort it to a military base in Iceland. Summers and Marks unlock the hijacker's phone, unintentionally starting a 30-minute timer for a bomb. Through words in a television news report claiming that Marks is hijacking their flight, Marks realizes that the bomb bypassed the security checks, and finds it in Hammond's cocaine briefcase. When some passengers attack Marks, Bowen stops them, believing that the bomb is the priority. Marks convinces the others of his innocence, and has them move the bomb to the rear and surround it with luggage to direct the blast outward, while everybody moves to the front of the airplane. Marks tells Kyle to follow explosive protocol and descend to 8,000 feet, from a cruising altitude of 30,000 feet and speed of 500&nbsp;mph, as the current [[Uncontrolled decompression|pressure differential]] will destroy the airplane if the bomb explodes, although the escorting jets refuse to let Kyle deviate from his course. Watching the earlier video, Marks notices Bowen planting the phone on Wheeler, implicating Bowen as the mastermind of the murders and White is Bowen's accomplice. \n\nBowen reveals that his father was killed in the [[September 11 attacks]] and blames the U.S. for not improving their security enough to prevent future similar attacks. Their goal was to frame Marks as a terrorist, thus ruining the reputation of the Air Marshals Service to force the U.S. to create stronger security laws. Marks persuades White, who was in it for the money, to try to disarm the bomb. Bowen, who wishes to die on the plane in a suicide mission, double-crosses White. Kyle descends the plane to 8,000 feet, giving Marks the opportunity to kill Bowen. White attacks Marks, still wanting to escape the aircraft, but the bomb detonates, killing him and blowing open the back of the plane. Despite the damage, Rice lands the plane in Iceland, with no loss of life. Marks is praised as a hero. It is implied he and Summers may begin a relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as Bill Marks, a Federal Air Marshal and former [[New York Police Department|NYPD officer]]\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Jen Summers\n* [[Scoot McNairy]] as Tom Bowen\n* [[Michelle Dockery]] as Nancy, a flight attendant\n* [[Nate Parker]] as Zack White\n* [[Corey Stoll]] as Austin Reilly, a passenger and NYPD officer\n* [[Lupita Nyong'o]] as Gwen, a flight attendant\n* [[Omar Metwally]] as Dr. Fahim Nasir\n* [[Jason Butler Harner]] as Kyle Rice, the co-pilot\n* [[Linus Roache]] as David McMillan, the [[Captain (airlines)|captain]] of the flight\n* [[Shea Whigham]] as Agent Marenick, a [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] agent\n* [[Anson Mount]] as Jack Hammond, the other Federal Air Marshal working on the flight\n* [[Quinn McColgan]] as Becca, a little girl whom Bill befriends\n* [[Corey Hawkins]] as Travis Mitchell, a smart-mouthed passenger\n* Frank Deal as Charles Wheeler, a bankruptcy attorney\n* [[Bar Paly]] as Iris Marianne, a lascivious passenger\n}}\n\n{{Anchor|Production}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began on November 1, 2012, at York Studios in [[Maspeth, Queens]], [[New York City]], then continued at [[John F.
