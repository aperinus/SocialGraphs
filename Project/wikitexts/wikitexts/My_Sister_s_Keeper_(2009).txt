Beginning with the harvest of her [[umbilical cord]] at birth, Anna has donated compatible blood and stem cells to Kate, and her life is one of hospitalizations, growth hormone injections, opioid painkillers, sleeping pills, bleeding, and infections. Sara has no qualms over using Anna's body to treat Kate's, and fully believes she is doing so willingly, while Brian is closer to Anna and has his own misgivings.\n\nAfter Kate goes into [[kidney failure]], Anna \u2013 with Jesse's help \u2013 approaches attorney Campbell Alexander, and tells him she wishes to sue for [[medical emancipation]], on the basis that she will be required to donate one of hers, and that having just a single kidney will severely restrict her quality of life. Campbell, whose covert [[epilepsy]] lends him sympathy to her predicament, decides to take her case pro bono and, representing Anna as her guardian ''[[ad litem]]'', he files a suit for partial termination of [[Parents' rights movement|parental rights]]. This immediately causes a rift between Anna and Sara, and Brian moves Anna into his fire station to separate them.\n\nFlashbacks detail Kate and Anna's close relationship and how Kate's illness has affected Jesse, who has run away from his summer camp. Kate meets a fellow cancer patient, Taylor, and they begin dating. They slow-dance at the hospital's prom for teen patients and later have sex. A few days later, Kate is upset to have not seen Taylor since. Learning that Taylor has died, she attempts suicide by overdosing on painkillers but Anna stops her. Kate expresses hope that after she dies she will see Taylor.\n\nAfter Sara is unable to get the suit thrown out, Anna's case proceeds to trial. Shortly before the hearing, Kate requests to go to the beach one last time. Brian obtains permission and discharges her from the hospital for the day. Sara demands that Kate be returned to the hospital, but Brian refuses and threatens to divorce Sara if she does not join them. They enjoy one final family outing.\n\nAt the hearing, Jesse witnesses Sara's aggressive cross-examination of Anna on the stand, and finally having had enough, he forces Anna to reveal that she is in fact acting under Kate's wishes, and not her own. While Anna had genuinely wanted to donate her kidney, Kate \u2013 having endured 11 years of her own and her family's suffering \u2013 had asked her to refuse. Sara is forced to acknowledge that Kate has been trying to tell her for a long time, that she is ready to die. Kate dies in her sleep later that day with her mother by her side.\n\nAfter Kate's death, Campbell reports that Anna has won the case. Now reconciled, the family moves on with their lives. Sara, who gave up practicing law to look after Kate, returns to work, Brian retires from firefighting and counsels troubled youths, and Jesse receives an arts scholarship in New York. Anna reveals that every year on Kate's birthday, they go to [[Montana]], which was her \"most favorite place in the world\". She concludes that she was not born merely to save her sister, she was born because she had a sister, and that their relationship continues even in death.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- The cast are ordered per opening tombstone credits, plus two named in the plot, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{castlist|\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as Sara Fitzgerald\n* [[Abigail Breslin]] as Anna Fitzgerald\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Campbell Alexander\n* [[Jason Patric]] as Brian Fitzgerald\n* [[Sofia Vassilieva]] as Kate Fitzgerald\n* [[Heather Wahlquist]] as Aunt Kelly\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Judge Joan De Salvo\n* Evan Ellingson as Jesse Fitzgerald\n* [[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]] as Taylor Ambrose\n* [[David Thornton (actor)|David Thornton]] as Dr. Harrison Chance\n}}\n\n==Production==\nUpon the original creation of the film adaptation, sisters [[Dakota Fanning|Dakota]] and [[Elle Fanning]] were cast to play Kate and Anna respectively.
