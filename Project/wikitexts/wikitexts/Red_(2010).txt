An assassination squad attempts to kill Frank, but he single-handedly kills the entire squad and drives to Sarah's house to protect her. Sarah refuses to leave with Frank so he kidnaps her. CIA agent William Cooper is tasked by his corrupt boss Cynthia to kill Frank.\n\nFrank ties up Sarah in a Louisiana motel room while he visits his former mentor Joe at a retirement home for help identifying the squad. He learns the same squad murdered a newspaper reporter in New York. Sarah gets loose and calls 9-1-1, accidentally alerting Cooper to her location. Frank saves her. Cooper chases them in a car but they escape to New York City to investigate the reporter who was killed. They find a list of names the reporter was investigating, almost all of whom have recently died. Frank calls Joe but is told Joe has been killed.\n\nFrank and Sarah find retired agent Marvin Boggs in Florida, whose name is on the list. Marvin finds all the names on the list are connected to a secret 1981 mission in Guatemala. The three track down pilot Gabriel Singer who flew the mission. He helps Frank and Marvin remember the mission but is killed by a sniper in a helicopter. Frank, Marvin, and Sarah escape. Frank secures the help of retired FSB agent Ivan Simanov in exchange for a favor, and with Sarah infiltrates the Secure Records Vault at the CIA to obtain the Guatemala file. The records keeper tells Frank that Cooper pulled his file, so Frank pays Cooper a surprise visit in his office. Frank dislocates Cooper's shoulder and Cooper shoots and wounds Frank. Frank and Sarah find Marvin being held at gunpoint by Joe, who survived the attack at the retirement home. The group seeks help from retired British assassin Victoria Winslow, who stitches Frank's wound and joins the group as they decide to meet with Alexander Dunning, an arms dealer who is the only name left on the list still alive besides Frank and Marvin.\n\nJoe meets with Dunning posing as an African warlord wanting to purchase weapons. Dunning reveals the killings were ordered by the Vice President of the US to cover up the VP's mass killing of innocent villagers in Guatemala. Meanwhile, Cooper receives a tip leading him to Dunning's mansion where he confronts Frank. Joe sacrifices his life to help Frank and Marvin escape but Sarah is captured by Cooper. Frank breaks into Cooper's house while his family is there and calls Cooper, saying he intends to kill the VP and if Sarah is harmed he will kill Cooper's family.\n\nFinding the Guatemala file Frank left for him, Cooper realizes that he's being used in the coverup and has himself assigned to the VP's security detail. The group kidnap the VP from a fundraising dinner but Victoria is shot and is rescued by Ivan. Frank calls Cooper and arranges to trade the VP for Sarah. Cooper, Cynthia, and Dunning bring Sarah and meet with Frank. Dunning shoots the VP and offers to make Cooper CIA Director if Cooper kills Frank and Sarah. Cooper instead kills Cynthia while Frank charges Dunning and kills him. Frank and Sarah reunite and Cooper tells them all to leave and that he will clean up the situation.\n\nThe group leaves in Ivan's car and Ivan cashes in his favor from Frank. Sarah insists she go along with Frank and Marvin to deal with an issue in Moldova. Frank and Marvin are then shown fleeing Moldovan troops with a stolen nuclear device.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Frank Moses, a former CIA [[Black operation|black ops]] agent.

The creators of the comic exercised their right to go elsewhere, but this required approval from all divisions of Warner Bros., including television, before it could be approved. After several years, in 2008, Noveck was allowed to take the project to Mark Vahradian at Di Bonaventura Productions. Unusually, this made it the first film from DC not produced by Warner Bros., after the purchase.<ref name=\"thr-escape\">\n{{cite web\n| date = October 13, 2010\n| last = Kit\n| first = Borys\n| title = Secret Origin: How 'RED' escaped Warner Bros. and ended up at Summit\n| url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/heat-vision/secret-origin-how-red-escaped-19074\n| work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]]\n| access-date = January 29, 2011\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101114002616/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/heat-vision/secret-origin-how-red-escaped-19074\n| archive-date = November 14, 2010\n| url-status = dead\n| df = mdy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn June 2008, [[Summit Entertainment]] announced plans to adapt Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner's ''[[Red (WildStorm comics)|Red]]''.
