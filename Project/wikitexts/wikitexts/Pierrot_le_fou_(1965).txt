The film is based on the 1962 novel ''Obsession'' by [[Lionel White]]. It was Godard's tenth feature film, released between ''[[Alphaville (film)|Alphaville]]'' and ''[[Masculin, f\u00e9minin]]''. The plot follows Ferdinand, an unhappily married man, as he escapes his boring society and travels from Paris to the Mediterranean Sea with Marianne, a girl chased by [[Organisation Arm\u00e9e Secr\u00e8te|OAS]] hitmen from Algeria.\n\nIt was the 15th-highest grossing film of the year, with a total of 1,310,580 admissions in France.<ref name=\"JPBox Office\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jpbox-office.com/fichfilm.php?id=9218&affich=france|title=Pierrot le fou (1965) \u2013 JPBox-Office|work=jpbox-office.com|access-date=14 March 2016}}</ref> The film was selected as the French entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[38th Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.<ref>Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nFerdinand Griffon is unhappily married and has been recently fired from his job at a TV broadcasting company. After attending a mindless party full of shallow discussions in Paris, he feels a need to escape and decides to run away with ex-girlfriend Marianne Renoir, leaving his wife and children and [[bourgeois]] lifestyle. Following Marianne into her apartment and finding a corpse, Ferdinand soon discovers that Marianne is being chased by [[Organisation de l'arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te|OAS]] gangsters, two of whom they barely escape. Marianne and Ferdinand, whom she calls [[Pierrot]] \u2013 an unwelcome nickname meaning \"sad clown\" \u2013 go on a crime spree from Paris to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the dead man's car. They lead an unorthodox life, always on the run, pursued by the police and by the OAS gangsters. When they settle down in the [[French Riviera]] after burning the dead man's car (which had been full of money, unbeknownst to Marianne) and sinking a second car into the [[Mediterranean Sea]], their relationship becomes strained. Ferdinand reads books, philosophizes, and writes a diary. They spend a few days on a desert island.\n\nA dwarf, who is one of the gangsters, kidnaps Marianne. She kills him with a pair of scissors. Ferdinand finds him murdered and is caught and bludgeoned by two of his accomplices, who waterboard him to make him reveal Marianne\u2019s whereabouts. Marianne escapes, and she and Ferdinand are separated. He settles in [[Toulon]] while she searches for him everywhere until she finds him. After their eventual reunion, Marianne uses Ferdinand to get a suitcase full of money before running away with her real boyfriend, Fred, to whom she had previously referred as her brother. Ferdinand shoots Marianne and Fred, then paints his face blue and decides to blow himself up by tying sticks of red and yellow dynamite to his head. He regrets this at the last second and tries to extinguish the fuse, but he fails and is blown up.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] as Ferdinand Griffon, a.k.a. \"Pierrot\"\n* [[Anna Karina]] as Marianne Renoir\n* [[Graziella Galvani]] as Maria Griffon\n* Dirk Sanders as Fred\n* Jimmy Karoubi as Dwarf\n* [[Roger Dutoit]] as Gangster #1\n* [[Hans Meyer (actor)|Hans Meyer]] as Gangster #2\n* [[Samuel Fuller]] as Himself\n* Princesse A\u00efcha Abadie as Herself\n* Alexis Poliakoff as Saylor\n* [[Raymond Devos]] as Man of the port\n* [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szab\u00f3 (actor)|L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szab\u00f3]] as Lazlo Kovacs, Political exile\n* [[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]] as Young Man in Movie Theatre\n* [[Georges Staquet]] as Staquet\n* [[Henri Attal]] as Gas station attendant #1\n* [[Dominique Zardi]] as Gas station attendant #2\n* Viviane Blassel\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Themes and style==\nLike many of Godard's films, ''Pierrot le fou'' features characters who break the [[fourth wall]] by looking into the camera. It also includes startling editing choices; for example, when Pierrot throws a cake at a woman in the party scene, Godard cuts to an exploding firework just as it hits her. The film has many of the characteristics of the then dominant [[pop art]] movement,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BY6vxfbcglsC&q=%22pierrot+le+fou%22+%22pop+art&pg=PA12|title=The Art and Politics of Film|isbn=9780748611997|access-date=14 March 2016|last1=Orr|first1=John|year=2000}}</ref> making constant disjunctive references to various elements of [[mass culture]]. Like much pop art, the film uses visuals drawn from [[cartoon]]s and employs an intentionally garish visual aesthetic based on bright [[primary color]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/features/new-waves/pop-cinema.html|title=Pop Cinema: Jean-Luc Godard's Pierrot le fou|website=www.nga.gov|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[Sylvie Vartan]] was Godard's first choice for the role of Marianne but her agent refused.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/1994-11-09/1994-11-09-711754|title=Interview with Sylvie Vartan (in French)}}</ref><ref name=\"Willis\">[http://assets.cambridge.org/97805215/73757/sample/9780521573757wsn01.pdf Jean-Luc Godard's Pierrot le fou] ed.
