The film stars [[Adam Sandler]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Jada Pinkett Smith]], [[Liv Tyler]], [[Donald Sutherland]], [[Saffron Burrows]] and Mike Binder.\n\nDistributed by [[Columbia Pictures]], the film was theatrically released on March 23, 2007, and on DVD and [[Blu-ray]] on October 9, 2007.\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|Twin Towers went down in 2001]], Charlie Fineman lost everything important in his life. Five years have passed since Charlie's wife and daughters died, and now the once-successful and sociable man has become a withdrawn shadow of his former self. He does not discuss his loss, causing his in-laws to worry for his sanity, believing that he has struck the tragedy from his mind.\n\nWhen fate brings Charlie and his former college roommate Alan Johnson together once again on a Manhattan street corner, Alan is shocked to see just how far his old friend has fallen. Charlie's hair is long and he wears a headset constantly to let music drown out any mentions of his wife and children.\n\nThough on the surface it would appear that Alan, a successful dentist, has it all, the pressures of a family and career have been weighing heavily on him. At a pivotal moment when Charlie and Alan both need a trusted friend, the restorative power of a rekindled friendship provides a lifeline needed to move forward.\n\nAlan endeavors to bring Charlie out of his shell by convincing him to see a therapist. Barely communicative, he ends every session after only a couple of minutes. His therapist says he needs to tell the story about his family to someone eventually and Charlie soon tells Alan his tragic story. Later on, following a [[suicide by cop]] attempt, Charlie ends up in a psychiatric ward.\n\nLegal proceedings commence, and Judge David Raines must determine whether to [[involuntary commitment|commit]] Charlie to psychiatric care. After Charlie suffers a breakdown, Raines leaves the decision to Charlie's in-laws, asking them to think of what their daughter would want for him. Charlie approaches his in-laws in the lobby of the courthouse, stating that he does not carry pictures nor discuss his family because he sees them every day, in the faces of people walking down the street. They decide that he should not be committed; instead, Charlie moves to a new apartment, leaving behind the painful memories associated with his former home.\n\nAlan visits Charlie in his new home and his wife calls and tells him \"I love you and just want you to come home.\" The apartment's doorman brings out Charlie's scooter, telling Alan not to leave stuff lying around. He tells the doorman to take it back upstairs, but he does not respond. Not knowing what to do, Alan decides to ride home on the scooter.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Dr. Charlie Fineman\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as Dr. Alan Johnson\n* [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] as Janeane Johnson\n* [[Liv Tyler]] as Dr. Angela Oakhurst, Charlie's therapist\n* [[Saffron Burrows]] as Donna Remar, Alan's \"stalker\" patient\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as committal hearing Judge David Raines\n* [[Robert Klein]] as Jonathan Timpleman, Charlie's father in-law\n* [[Melinda Dillon]] as Ginger Timpleman, Charlie's mother in-law\n* [[Mike Binder]] (film's director) as Bryan Sugarman, Charlie's protective pre-tragedy best friend\n* [[Jonathan Banks]] as Stelter, Alan's abrasive dental practice partner\n* [[John de Lancie]] as Nigel Pennington, a \"covert\" therapist Alan arranges\n* [[Rae Allen]] as Adell Modell, Charlie's protective landlady\n* [[Paula Newsome]] as Melanie, Alan's protective dental practice receptionist\n* [[Ted Raimi]] as Peter Saravino, Charlie's committal hearing lawyer\n* [[B.
