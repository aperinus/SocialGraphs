He also started working on the sequel titled ''[[Battle Royale II: Requiem]]'', but died of [[prostate cancer]] on January 12, 2003, after shooting only one scene with Kitano. His son [[Kenta Fukasaku]], who wrote the screenplay for both films, completed the film in 2003.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nIn the near-future, following a major [[Lost Decade (Japan)|recession]], the [[Japanese government]] has passed the \"BR ACT\" to curb the nation's juvenile delinquency. Middle school student Shuya Nanahara copes with life after his father committed [[suicide in Japan|suicide]]. Their teacher, Kitano, resigns after being wounded by Yoshitoki Kuninobu, Shuya's best friend.\n\nOne year later, Shuya's class takes a field trip, but they are gassed and taken to a remote island. Kitano reappears surrounded by [[Japanese Self-Defense Forces|JSDF soldiers]], explaining that the class was chosen to participate in the annual Battle Royale as a result of the Act: they have three days to fight to the death until a victor emerges; explosive collars will kill uncooperative students or those within designated \"danger zones\". Each student is provided rations, a map, supplies, and a random weapon. Kitano kills two of the students for disobedience, one of them being Kuninobu.\n\nThe first six hours see twelve deaths, four by suicide. The psychotic Mitsuko Souma and psychopathic Kazuo Kiriyama become the most dangerous players to others in the game. Transfer student Shogo Kawada lets Shuya go after killing one student, while Shuya accidentally kills another student. Basketball player Shinji Mimura plots to hack into the computer system to disrupt the program.\n\nAmid shifting loyalties and violent confrontations, Shuya promises to keep Noriko Nakagawa safe, feeling it a duty to his fallen friend, as Kuninobu secretly loved her. Kawada reveals to the pair that he won a previous Battle Royale at the cost of his girlfriend, whose death he seeks to avenge. Kiriyama attacks and Shuya is wounded by his [[Uzi]]. He is saved by Hiroki Sugimura, who had his best friend die in his arms.\n\nShuya awakens in the island's lighthouse, bandaged by Yukie Utsumi, who has a crush on him. Five other girls are also hiding in the building. One of them, Yuko, attempts to poison him out of fear of him killing them. However, Yuka accidentally eats the food, leading to a shootout between the girls. Yuko is the only survivor; horrified, she commits suicide. Shuya, Noriko and Kawada set out to find Mimura.\n\nKiriyama kills Mitsuko, making Noriko the last surviving girl. Mimura, with two others, infiltrates the JSDF's computer system. Kiriyama kills them, but not before Mimura uses his homemade bomb to blow up the base to hide all evidence. When the trio arrives at the burning base, Kawada kills Kiriyama, who had his eyes burned out by the explosion, but in turn is injured by his [[Uzi]].\n\nOn the final day, Kawada, aware of the collars' internal microphones, seemingly kills Shuya and Noriko by shooting them. Suspicious, Kitano ends the game, intent on personally killing the victor. He realizes that Kawada hacked the system months beforehand, and disabled Shuya and Noriko's tracking devices. The trio confronts Kitano in the control room, and he unveils a homemade painting of the massacred class depicting Noriko as the sole survivor. He reveals that he was unable to bear the hatred between him and his students, having been rejected by his own daughter, and confesses that he always thought of Noriko as a daughter. He asks her to kill him, but Shuya shoots him after he threatens her. Kitano's daughter calls him; after an argument, he dies of his wounds.\n\nThe trio leaves the island on a boat, but Kawada dies from his injuries, happy that he found friendship. Shuya and Noriko are declared fugitives, last seen on the run toward [[Shibuya Station]]. Noriko gives Shuya the Seto Dragon Claw [[butterfly knife]] Kuninobu used to injure Kitano at the beginning as they flee together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Battle Royale characters}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tatsuya Fujiwara]] as [[Shuya Nanahara]]\n* [[Aki Maeda]] as [[Noriko Nakagawa]]\n* [[Tar\u014d Yamamoto]] as [[Shogo Kawada]]\n* [[Takeshi Kitano]] as [[List of Battle Royale characters#Kitano|Kitano]]\n* [[Masanobu And\u014d]] as [[List of Battle Royale characters#Kazuo Kiriyama|Kazuo Kiriyama]]\n* [[Kou Shibasaki]] as [[Mitsuko Souma]]\n* [[Chiaki Kuriyama]] as [[List of Battle Royale characters#Takako Chigusa|Takako Chigusa]]\n* [[Takashi Tsukamoto]] as [[Shinji Mimura]]\n* [[Yutaka Shimada]] as [[Yutaka Seto]]\n* [[Sousuke Takaoka]] as [[Hiroki Sugimura]]\n* Eri Ishikawa as [[List of Battle Royale characters#Yukie Utsumi|Yukie Utsumi]]\n* Hitomi Hyuga as [[List of Battle Royale characters#Yuko Sakaki|Yuko Sakaki]]\n* Yukihiro Kotani as [[Kuninobu Yoshitoki|Yoshitoki Kuninobu]]\n* Sayaka Ikeda as [[List of Battle Royale characters#Megumi Eto|Megumi Eto]]\n* [[Takayo Mimura]] as [[List of Battle Royale characters#Kayoko Kotohiki|Kayoko Kotohiki]]\n* [[Minami Hinase|Minami]] as [[List of Battle Royale characters#Keiko|Keiko Onuki]]\n* [[Y\u016bko Miyamura]] as Training Video Girl\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\nRoughly 6,000 actors auditioned for the film, which was narrowed down to 800 potential cast members.

And more vividly, he was a real [[game show]] presenter, known for hosting popular [[Japanese game shows]] such as ''[[Takeshi's Castle]]'' (1986\u20131990), adding a sense of potential realism to the film's extreme game show concept.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Taylor-Jones |first1=Kate E. |title=Rising Sun, Divided Land: Japanese and South Korean Filmmakers |date=2013 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |isbn=978-0-231-85044-5 |page=67 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfaEAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA67}}</ref>\n\n===Creative process===\n[[Kinji Fukasaku]] stated that he decided to direct the film because the novel it was adapted from reminded him of his time as a 15-year-old [[munitions]] factory worker during [[World War II]]. At that time, his class was made to work in a munitions factory. In July 1945, the factory came under artillery fire. The children could not escape so they dived under each other for cover. The surviving members of the class had to dispose of the corpses. At that point, Fukasaku realised that the Japanese government was lying about World War II, and he developed a burning hatred of adults in general that he maintained for a long time afterwards.<ref name=\"BRBritishInterview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.battleroyalethemovie.com/staff.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20021205020037/http://www.battleroyalethemovie.com/staff.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2002-12-05|title= Director's statement at the Internet Archive|access-date=2006-12-30 }}</ref>\n\n[[Beat Takeshi]] told a documentary crew during filming that he believes \"an actor's job is to satisfy the director&nbsp;...

When the interviewer told Fukasaku that he asked the question specifically because of the word \"run\" in the concluding text, which the interviewer described as \"very positive\", Fukasaku explained that he developed the concept throughout the film. Fukasaku interpreted the interviewer's question as having \"a stronger meaning\" than \"a simple message.\" He further explained that the film simply contains his \"words to the next generation\", so the viewer should decide whether to take the words as advice or as a warning.<ref name=\"BRBritishInterview\"/><ref name=\"Midnighteyeint\">\"[http://www.midnighteye.com/interviews/kinji_fukasaku.shtml Kinji Fukasaku]\", ''Midnight Eye''</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe [[film score]] of ''Battle Royale'' was composed, arranged and conducted by [[Masamichi Amano]], performed by the [[Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra]] and features several pieces of [[Western classical music]] along with Amano's original compositions.

She comes home from school to find her mother drunk with a strange man, who tries to molest her. She then pushes him down the staircase to his death.\n* Three epilogues (referred to as \"requiems\"). The first is an extension of the basketball scene, showing the students of Class 3-B winning their game. It also spotlights Mitsuko's apparent social anxiety and alienation from the classmates in 3-B. The second is a vision of Nobu telling Shuya to take care of Noriko (a replay of a hallucination seen earlier in the special version of the film). The third is a scene between Kitano and Noriko, who talk casually by a riverbank; parts of this scene (a dream sequence) also appear in the original version of the film, but with the dialogue muted whereas in the requiem it is audible and reveals a friendship or other relationship that may or may not have existed between Noriko and Kitano.\n* Added shots of the lighthouse after the shoot-out.\n* Added reaction shots in the classroom, and extensions to existing shots.\n* Extra CGI throughout the film.\n\n===3D theatrical re-release===\nThe film was released to theaters in [[3-D film|3D]] in Japan on November 20, 2010.
