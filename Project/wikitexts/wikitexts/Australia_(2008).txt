The film is a character story, set between 1939 and 1942 against a dramatised backdrop of events across northern Australia at the time, such as the [[bombing of Darwin]] during [[World War II]].\n\nProduction took place in [[Sydney]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Kununurra, Western Australia|Kununurra]] and [[Bowen, Queensland|Bowen]]. The film was released to cinemas on 26 November 2008 in the United States<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=australia.htm|title=Australia|publisher=Box Office Mojo|language=en|date=26 November 2008|access-date=22 January 2017}}</ref> and in Australia on 26 December 2008, with subsequent worldwide release dates throughout late December 2008 and January and February 2009. ''Australia'' received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $211 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1939, weeks before the start of [[World War II]], Lady Sarah Ashley of England travels to Australia to force her philandering husband to sell his faltering [[cattle station]], Faraway Downs. The huge station straddles [[Western Australia]] and the [[Northern Territory]], reaching north to the [[Timor Sea]]. Her husband sends an independent cattle [[Drover (Australian)|drover]], called \"The Drover,\" to transport her to Faraway Downs.\n\nLady Sarah's husband is murdered before she arrives; the authorities tell her the killer is an [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] [[Aboriginal elder|elder]] nicknamed \"King George.\" The station's manager, Neil Fletcher, secretly tries to gain control of Faraway Downs in order to sell it to meat tycoon Lesley 'King' Carney, thereby creating a complete cattle [[monopoly]]. Meanwhile, at [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Logistics officer#Australia|Australian Army logistics officer]] Captain Dutton negotiates beef prices with Carney on behalf of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].\n\nThe childless Lady Sarah is captivated by the boy Nullah, who has an Aboriginal mother and a white father. Nullah, who has been spying on Fletcher, reveals his plan to Lady Sarah, who fires Fletcher and runs the cattle station aided by her remaining staff. The next day, policemen arrive to take Nullah away to Mission Island as they have with other half-Aboriginal children. While evading them, Nullah's mother Daisy drowns when she hides with him in a water tower. Lady Sarah comforts Nullah by singing the song \"[[Over the Rainbow]].\" Nullah tells her that \"King George\" is his grandfather, and that like the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]], he too is a \"magic man\".\n\nLady Sarah persuades Drover to take the cattle to Darwin for sale. Drover leads a team of seven riders, including his Aboriginal brother-in-law Magarri, Goolaj, Nullah, Lady Sarah, Bandy, and the station's accountant Kipling Flynn, to drive the 1,500 cattle to Darwin. They encounter various obstacles along the way, including a fire set by Carney's men that scares the cattle, resulting in the death of Flynn when the group rushes to stop the cattle from stampeding over a cliff. Lady Sarah and Drover fall in love, and she grows to appreciate the Australian territory. The two share a romantic moment under a tree, where he reveals that he was once married to an Aboriginal woman who died after being refused medical treatment in a white hospital. Because he is friendly with the Aboriginals, many of the other whites in the territory shun him. Lady Sarah reveals her inability to have biological children. Over the next few days, the team drives the cattle through the treacherous [[Never Never (Australian outback)|Never Never]] desert. Upon finally arriving at Darwin, the group races to load the cattle onto the ship before Carney's cattle in order to secure payment.\n\nLady Sarah, Nullah, and Drover happily lived together at Faraway Downs for two years. Meanwhile, Fletcher manages to take over Carney's cattle empire after orchestrating Carney's death in an accident and marrying his daughter, Catherine, all between 1940 and 1941. He returns to Faraway Downs and threatens Nullah's safety unless Lady Sarah sells her cattle station. Fletcher intimidates her by revealing that ''he'' murdered Lady Sarah's husband (not \"King George\") and that he is also Nullah's father.\n\nNullah intends to go on a [[walkabout]] with \"King George,\" much to Lady Sarah's dismay. She and Drover argue about what is best for Nullah, after which Drover leaves Faraway Downs. Nullah is apprehended by the authorities and sent to live on Mission Island. Lady Sarah, who has come to regard Nullah as her adopted son, vows to rescue him. As World War II escalates, she goes to work as a radio operator alongside Catherine. When the Japanese [[Bombing of Darwin|attack Mission Island and Darwin]] in 1942, Lady Sarah fears that Nullah has been killed.\n\nDrover returns to Darwin after hearing about the attack. He learns of Nullah's abduction to Mission Island and goes with Magarri, Ivan, and a young [[Brother (Christian)|Christian brother]] to rescue him and the other children. During the rescue, Magarri sacrifices himself as a diversion so the others can flee. Meanwhile, Lady Sarah and the other townsfolk are being evacuated South by Captain Dutton. Drover and the children sail into port at Darwin as Nullah plays \"Over the Rainbow\" on his harmonica; Lady Sarah hears the music and the three are reunited. Fletcher, distraught at his financial ruin and Catherine's death during the Japanese attack, attempts to shoot Nullah with a soldier's rifle. As Lady Sarah and Drover rush to save Nullah, \"King George\" strikes Fletcher with a spear, killing him.\n\nLady Sarah, Drover, and Nullah return to the safety of the remote Faraway Downs. Sometime later, \"King George\" calls out to Nullah, who returns to the [[Outback]] with his grandfather as Lady Sarah and Drover look on.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast (yes, all 21 of them) per tombstone closing credits order, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n*[[Nicole Kidman]] as Lady Sarah Ashley, an English aristocrat who inherits the cattle station Faraway Downs after the death of her husband, Lord Maitland Ashley\n*[[Hugh Jackman]] as The Drover, a [[Drover (Australian)|drover]] who helps Lady Sarah Ashley move the cattle across the property\n*[[David Wenham]] as Neil Fletcher, station manager who plans to take Faraway Downs from Lady Sarah Ashley\n*[[Bryan Brown]] as King Carney, a cattle baron who owns much of the land in northern Australia\n*[[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] as Kipling Flynn, the alcoholic accountant at Faraway Downs\n*[[David Gulpilil]] as King George, a magic tribal elder, grandfather of Nullah\n*[[Brandon Walters]] as Nullah, a young Aboriginal boy whom Lady Sarah Ashley finds at Faraway Downs\n*[[David Ngoombujarra]] as Magarri, the Drover's brother-in-law and best friend\n*[[Ben Mendelsohn]] as Captain Dutton, a Darwin-based Australian Army officer in charge of beef supply\n*[[Essie Davis]] as Catherine Carney, wife of Neil Fletcher and daughter of King Carney\n*[[Barry Otto]] as Administrator Allsop, the Australian government's representative\n*[[Kerry Walker]] as Myrtle Allsop\n*[[Sandy Gore]] as Gloria Carney, King Carney's wife, and Catherine's mother\n*[[Ursula Yovich]] as Daisy, the mother of Nullah\n*[[Lillian Crombie]] as Bandy Legs\n*[[Yuen Wah]] as Sing Song, a Cantonese cook at Faraway Downs\n*Angus Pilakui as Goolaj, the Drover's second colleague and friend\n*[[Jacek Koman]] as Ivan, the saloonkeeper and innkeeper in Darwin\n*[[Tony Barry]] as Sergeant Callahan, the head of the Northern Territory police\n*[[Ray Barrett]] as Ramsden, an old friendly fellow\n*[[Max Cullen]] as Old Drunk\n\nIn addition, [[Arthur Dignam]] and Matthew Whittet play the priest and [[Brother (Christian)|Christian brother]], respectively, at Mission Island.\n\n==Production==\nOriginally, Baz Luhrmann was planning to make a film about [[Alexander the Great]] starring [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and Nicole Kidman, with a screenplay by [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]].<ref name=\"fox\">{{cite news | author=Killian Fox | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/02/baz-luhrmann-nicole-kidman-australia | title=How we made the epic of Oz | work=The Guardian | date=2 November 2008 | access-date=11 November 2008 | location=London| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081209024706/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/nov/02/baz-luhrmann-nicole-kidman-australia| archive-date= 9 December 2008 |url-status = live}}</ref> The director had built a studio in the northern Sahara but ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'' made by [[Oliver Stone]] was released first and after several years in development, Luhrmann abandoned the project to make a film closer to home.<ref name=\"fox\" /> The visual effects were done by [[Animal Logic]] and The LaB Sydney.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Luhrmann spent six months researching general Australian history.<ref name=\"fox\" /> At one point he considered setting his film during the [[First Fleet]], 11 ships that sailed from Britain in 1787 and set up the first colony in [[New South Wales]].
