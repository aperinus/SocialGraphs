The plot focuses on Batman trying to stop [[Two-Face]] and the [[Riddler]] in their scheme to extract information from all the minds in [[Gotham City]] while adopting an orphaned acrobat named [[Dick Grayson]]\u2014who becomes his sidekick, [[Robin (character)|Robin]]\u2014and developing feelings for psychologist [[Dr. Chase Meridian]].\n\nSchumacher mostly eschewed the dark, dystopian atmosphere of Burton's films by drawing inspiration from the Batman comic books of the [[Dick Sprang]] era, as well as the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s television series]]. After Keaton chose not to reprise his role, [[William Baldwin]] and [[Ethan Hawke]] were considered as a replacement before Val Kilmer joined the cast.\n\n''Batman Forever'' was released on June 16, 1995, to mixed reviews from critics, who praised the visuals and some of the performances, but criticized the [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]], costume designs, and tonal departure from previous films. The film was a box office success, grossing over $336&nbsp;million worldwide and becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film worldwide of 1995. It was followed by ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' in 1997, with Schumacher returning as the director, Chris O'Donnell returning as Robin, and [[George Clooney]] replacing Kilmer as Batman.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn [[Gotham City]], local [[vigilante]] [[Bruce Wayne (1989 film series character)|Batman]] defuses a hostage situation orchestrated by a criminal known as [[Two-Face]], formerly [[district attorney]] [[Harvey Dent (1989 film series character)|Harvey Dent]]. Flashbacks reveal that Two-Face was disfigured with [[acid]] by mobster [[Sal Maroni]], which Batman failed to prevent, causing Dent to develop a [[split personality]]. [[Edward Nygma (Batman Forever)|Edward Nygma]], an eccentric researcher at [[Wayne Enterprises]], approaches his employer, Bruce Wayne (Batman's civilian identity), with an invention that can beam [[television]] signals directly into a person's brain. Bruce rejects the device, concerned the technology could [[Manipulation (psychology)|manipulate minds]]. After killing his supervisor and staging it as a suicide, Nygma resigns and plots revenge against Bruce, sending him [[riddle]]s. [[Criminal psychology|Criminal psychologist]] [[Dr. Leslie Thompkins|Dr. Chase Meridian]] diagnoses Nygma as [[psychotic]].\n\nBruce attends a [[Haly's Circus]] event with Chase. Two-Face hijacks the event and threatens to detonate a bomb unless Batman surrenders. Acrobat [[Dick Grayson (1989 film series character)|Dick Grayson]], the youngest member of the [[Flying Graysons]], manages to throw the bomb into the river, but Two-Face kills his family. Bruce persuades the orphaned Dick to live at [[Wayne Manor]] as his [[Ward (law)|ward]], and Dick discovers Bruce is Batman. Determined to avenge his family, Dick demands to join Batman in [[crime-fighting]], hoping to kill Two-Face, but Bruce refuses.\n\nNygma, inspired by Two-Face, adopts a criminal [[persona]], the [[Riddler]], and allies with Two-Face. They commit a series of [[Robbery|robberie]]s to finance Nygma's new company and mass-produce his [[brainwave]] device, the \"Box\", which steals information from users' minds and transfers it to Nygma's, which makes him smarter in the process. At a party hosted by Nygma, Batman pursues Two-Face and is almost killed but is saved by Dick.\n\nBatman visits Chase, who explains that she has fallen in love with Bruce. He reveals to her his secret identity. The Riddler and Two-Face, having discovered Bruce's secret through the Box, blow up the [[Batcave]], shooting Bruce and kidnapping Chase. As Bruce recovers, he and his butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]], deduce that Nygma is the Riddler. Bruce finally accepts Dick as Batman's partner, [[Robin (character)|Robin]].\n\nAt the Riddler's lair, Robin almost kills Two-Face, who holds him at gunpoint, but spares him. The Riddler reveals that Chase and Robin are bound and gagged in tubes above a deadly drop, giving Batman the chance to save only one. Batman distracts the Riddler with a riddle, before destroying the Riddler's brainwave receiver with a [[Batarang]], draining the Riddler's mind, and allowing Batman to rescue both. Two-Face corners them and determines their fate by flipping a coin, but Batman throws a handful of identical coins in the air, causing Two-Face to stumble in confusion and fall to his death.\n\nCommitted to [[Arkham Asylum]], Nygma now exclaims that he is Batman, flapping the arms of his [[straitjacket]], which leads Chase to remark that he is truly insane. Bruce resumes his crusade as Batman, with Robin as his partner.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Val Kilmer]] as [[Bruce Wayne (1989 film series character)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]: After coming across the journal of his father, Wayne starts questioning his act of vengeance. He struggles with his dual identity as a crime fighter, becoming romantically involved with Dr. Chase Meridian.\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as [[Harvey Dent (1989 film series character)|Harvey Dent / Two-Face]]: Formerly the good [[district attorney]] of [[Gotham City]].

He eventually discovers the [[Batcave]] and learns Bruce's secret identity. In his wake, he becomes the crime fighting partner, Robin.\n* [[Michael Gough]] as [[Alfred Pennyworth]]: The Wayne family's faithful butler and Bruce's confidant.

Photographs from these scenes have always been available since the film's release, shown in magazines such as [[Starlog]]. In 2005, ''Batman Forever'' was the only film in the franchise to include a dedicated deleted scenes selection among its bonus content on the special edition DVD.{{Repetition inline|date=September 2022}}\n\nAfter Joel Schumacher died on June 22, 2020, media outlets started reporting the possible existence of an extended cut, with the first rumors being thrown in by American [[journalist]] [[Marc Bernardin]]. Bernardin claimed it to be darker and contain less camp than the theatrical cut. Some of the differences include Bruce having a vision of a human-sized bat, less of an emphasis on Dick Grayson, and a focus on Bruce's psychological issues with Chase. The cut uses about 50 minutes of additional footage. Warner Bros. confirmed that alternative test screening cuts existed after an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', although they have no plans to release it and are unsure about what, if any, footage remains.
