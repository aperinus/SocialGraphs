Dickerson]] and written by James Gibson, based on the 1974 novel of the same name by [[Donald Goines]]. The film stars [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], [[David Arquette]] and [[Michael Ealy]], and is about a criminal drug dealer returning to the East Coast to find redemption and make amends with a drug lord. It premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 19, 2004, and made its theatrical release on March 26. ''Never Die Alone'' garnered generally negative reviews from critics who panned the trashy, pretentious and misogynistic viewpoint of street culture. However, DMX received praise for his performance as King David. It performed poorly at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=October 2015}}\nHardened criminal and drug dealer King David returns to his unidentified [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] city, where he can find redemption by settling an old score with drug lord Moon. He keeps tape-recorded journals about his life and is always talking about a woman named Edna. Upon David's return, he meets up with Jasper, a barkeep who expresses a strong dislike towards him. She contacts Moon to inform him of his return and willingness to pay his debt, as well as momentarily passing by Paul, a struggling writer.\n\nMike, one of Moon's henchmen, is assigned to collect his boss's money from David, appearing to be very interested in him for some reason. Before the deal, he is warned to not sabotage the deal to avert police attention. He, his friend Blue and his sister Ella go to David and collect the money. Mike is very tense upon arriving at the location of the pickup, prompting Blue to authorize it for him.\n\nAfter a brief but tense transaction between Blue and David, the latter is set up for an ambush. Mike angrily demands that David recognizes him, and proceeds to stab him multiple times in the [[abdomen]] after receiving several taunts. A weakened David stabs Blue in the eye with an ice pick before they abandon him in a gutter. Paul, who passes by at that moment, drives David, a total stranger, to the hospital.\n\nPaul is informed that King has died and has left him all his possessions. The items include jewelry, his car (which is a rare [[Stutz Blackhawk]]), and a collection of his audiotapes. Meanwhile, Moon is unnerved by Mike botching the deal by using violence against David and becomes paranoid of police attention.\n\nAfter being informed of Blue's injury, he tells the two to wait in a parking garage for a car to come and drive them to the hospital. Instead, he sets them up as two henchmen shoot and kill Blue and Ella, to Mike's horror. Just before Mike can be killed himself, he gains gravity of the situation and guns down the henchmen but is unable to retain his sister's life as she dies in his arms. He then vows revenge against Moon for the double-cross.\n\nAs Paul listens to the journal, the story of David's life is told: after a particularly bad drug experience in the east, David relocated to the west in search of a second chance. He finds assistance with the Vietnamese and even a new girlfriend, Janet, whom he abuses. A television star, she turns to David's heroin and becomes sick and detached in the process. David abandons her as she presumably turns to selling his drugs to pay the bills and for her drug habit.\n\nIn the present, Moon sends out a duo of henchmen to kill Mike. Additionally, Moon learns of Paul's involvement in the situation from bystanders as his role as David's driver to the hospital, and requests for his murder, as well. Meanwhile, Paul continues to listen to the tapes; after he abandons Janet, David moves on to Juanita, a college student he meets in an upscale bar.\n\nTheir relationship goes well as David starts to make a lot of money, but then Juanita tries his drugs. She doesn't get addicted, but she does turn out to be very selfish by refusing to move in with David, insisting that she is just having fun with him and that his stash of $250,000 isn't enough on which to retire. Hurt and angry, David secretly switches her cocaine with heroin, getting her addicted.\n\nPaul realizes that the money David talked about might be in David's trunk. It is, but at the same time, Moon's henchmen are sprawling all over the city in search of him. Mike follows Moon's limo via cab to a secluded back alley, at which he follows him into a bathhouse and proceeds to kill him.\n\nPaul listens to the last tape; David leaves Juanita, but she soon returns, addicted and begging for help. He agrees to help her, providing her a drug fix in exchange for rough, demeaning sex. The humiliation and disgrace shatter her dreams and causes her severe emotional distress, thus making her addictions even stronger. After a while, she demands that he pay for her entrance to rehabilitation or else she'll call the police. Enraged, David decides to do the same thing he did to Edna: mix her heroin with car battery acid, resulting in a fatal seizure for her. Through a flashback, it is revealed that David is the biological father of Mike, who is also Edna's child, and that David brutally hit him before poisoning Edna (which explains the scar on his face). The tape ends with David speculating on how his return to the East Coast will bring about his redemption with Moon and tie the loose end with Edna's child, who he is completely unaware of as Mike in their second encounter.\n\nPaul is found by Moon's henchmen, who hold him at gunpoint, but Mike arrives just in time and kills them. Paul tells Mike that King is his father, which greatly haunts the latter. As the police converge on the scene, the two make good their escape as Paul flees on foot and Michael takes David's car. It is revealed that Mike has a son of his own. Shortly afterward, Paul writes a story based on that night, titled \"Never Die Alone,\" which is turned down by a publishing magazine as the agent believes it to be a fictionalized story.\n\nDavid has cremated soon after. His narration focuses on the end of his life and how fate had such a powerful effect on not only his life but also on the lives of Paul, Mike, Edna, Juanita, Moon, and everyone else. Meanwhile, Mike drives through a tunnel and escapes without capture as David closes his narration with \"I wonder what lies ahead for me on the other side\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]] as David 'King David'\n* [[Michael Ealy]] as Michael\n* [[David Arquette]] as Paul\n* [[Clifton Powell]] as 'Moon'\n* [[Reagan Gomez-Preston]] as Juanita\n* [[Jennifer Sky]] as Janet\n* [[Luenell]] as Jasper\n* [[Drew Sidora]] as Ella\n* [[Antwon Tanner]] as 'Blue'\n* [[Keesha Sharp]] as Edna\n* [[Tommy Lister, Jr.]] as 'Rockie'\n* [[Aisha Tyler]] as Nancy\n* Damion Portier as Alvin\n* Jalil Jay Lynch as Earl\n* Big Daddy Wayne as 'Red'\n* [[Art Evans (actor)|Art Evans]] as Mr. Waters\n* Michele Shay as Juanita's Mother\n* Eric Payne as Orderly\n* Xavier Simmons as Young Michael\n* [[Paige Hurd]] as Young Ella (uncredited)\n* [[Rhoda Jordan]] as Brenda (uncredited)\n* [[Henry Gibson]] as Funeral Home Director (uncredited)\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nAs of January 2021, the film holds a 26% approval rating on [[Review aggregator|review aggregate]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 92 reviews with an average rating of a 4.3/10.
