It stars [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Kurt Russell]], [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], [[Walton Goggins]], [[Demi\u00e1n Bichir]], [[Tim Roth]], [[Michael Madsen]], and [[Bruce Dern]] as eight strangers who seek refuge from a blizzard in a [[stagecoach]] [[layover|stopover]] some time after the [[American Civil War]].\n\nTarantino announced the film in November 2013. He conceived it as a novel and sequel to his 2012 film ''[[Django Unchained]]'' before deciding to make it a standalone film. After the script [[Internet leak|leaked]] in January 2014, he canceled the film and instead directed a live reading at the [[Ace Hotel Los Angeles#United Artists Theater|United Artists Theater]] in Los Angeles, before reconsidering and resuming progress on the project. [[Principal photography|Filming]] began on December 8, 2014, near [[Telluride, Colorado]]. Italian composer [[Ennio Morricone]] composed the [[The Hateful Eight (soundtrack)|original score]], his first complete Western score in thirty-four years (and the last before his death in 2020), his first for a high-profile Hollywood production since [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[Mission to Mars]]'', and the first and only original score for a Tarantino film.\n\nDistributed by [[The Weinstein Company]] in the United States, ''The Hateful Eight'' was released on December 25, 2015, in a limited [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] release on [[70 mm film]], before expanding wide theatrically on December 30, 2015. The film was praised for its direction, screenplay, score, cinematography, and Leigh's performance, though the depiction of race relations and the violent treatment of Leigh's character divided opinions. It has grossed over $156 million. For his work on the score, Morricone won his only [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] after his five previous nominations. The film also earned [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (Leigh) and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] ([[Robert Richardson (cinematographer)|Robert Richardson]]).\n\nOn April 25, 2019, the film was released as a re-edited four-episode [[miniseries]] on [[Netflix]] with the subtitle ''Extended Version''.<ref name=\"Sharf\">{{cite web|last=Sharf|first=Zack|date=April 25, 2019|title=Tarantino's Extended 'Hateful Eight' Hits Netflix With Big Surprise: It's a Four-Episode Miniseries|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/04/quentin-tarantino-hateful-eight-extended-netflix-miniseries-episodes-1202128078/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426030608/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/04/quentin-tarantino-hateful-eight-extended-netflix-miniseries-episodes-1202128078/|archive-date=April 26, 2019|access-date=April 26, 2019|work=[[IndieWire]]}}</ref> ''The Hateful Eight'' is Tarantino's final collaboration with The Weinstein Company following [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases|allegations of sexual abuse]] against [[Harvey Weinstein]] in October 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn 1877, [[bounty hunter]] and [[African-American]] [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] veteran Major Marquis Warren is heading to Red Rock, [[Wyoming]], with three bounty corpses. His horse gives out, and faced with an incoming blizzard, Warren hitches a ride on a stagecoach driven by O.B. Aboard is bounty hunter John Ruth, handcuffed to fugitive Daisy Domergue, whom he is taking to Red Rock to be hanged. Ruth and Warren had previously bonded over Warren's personal letter from [[Abraham Lincoln]]. [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost-Causer]] Chris Mannix, who claims to be Red Rock's new sheriff, also joins them. During the trip, Ruth learns about the Confederate bounty placed on Warren for breaking out of and setting fire to a [[prisoner-of-war camp]].\n\nThey seek refuge from the blizzard at Minnie's Haberdashery. Greeting them is Bob, a Mexican who says Minnie is away and left him in charge. The other lodgers are Red Rock's new hangman, Oswaldo Mobray; [[cowboy]] Joe Gage; and elderly Confederate general Sanford Smithers, who is planning to erect a [[cenotaph]] for his missing son. Suspicious, Ruth disarms all but Warren. Mannix surmises, and Warren concedes, that the Lincoln letter is false. Warren responds to Ruth's disappointment by saying his forged letter buys him leeway with whites, something Ruth silently acknowledges he never would have given Warren without.\n\nWarren leaves a gun next to Sanford and provokes him by claiming that he sexually assaulted and murdered Smithers' son, who had tried to kill Warren for the bounty. When the enraged Smithers reaches for the gun, Warren kills him in revenge for ordering the slaughter of black [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] at [[Battle of Baton Rouge (1862)|Baton Rouge]].\n\nSome [[coffee]] is brewed and laced with poison. Ruth and O.B. drink it and O.B. dies, but Ruth lives long enough to attack Daisy, who then shoots him dead with his own gun. Warren disarms Domergue, leaving her shackled to Ruth's corpse, and holds the others at gunpoint. He is joined by Mannix, whom Warren trusts because he nearly drank the poisoned coffee. Examining the evidence and revealing Minnie's [[Anti-Mexican sentiment|hatred of Mexicans]], Warren deduces that Bob had been lying and thus had a part in the owners' deaths, and promptly executes him. When Warren threatens to kill Daisy, Gage admits he poisoned the coffee. An unknown man hiding under the floorboards shoots Warren in the groin. Mobray draws a hidden gun and shoots Mannix, who fires back and fatally wounds him.\n\nA flashback shows Bob, Mobray, Gage, and Daisy's brother Jody arriving at the lodge hours earlier. They gun down Minnie and her customers; Smithers is spared when he agrees to stay silent while the group prepares to spring Daisy from Ruth's custody. The bodies are hastily thrown down the well outside. Once they finish cleaning the store, Jody hides in the cellar. In the present, Mannix and Warren, both seriously wounded, hold Daisy, Gage, and Mobray at gunpoint. When they threaten to kill Daisy, Jody surrenders and is executed by Warren. The surviving gang members offer Mannix a deal. They claim fifteen hired guns are waiting in Red Rock in case the rescue attempt fails. If Mannix kills Warren, they will spare him and allow him to collect the bounty on the dying Mobray and the deceased Bob.\n\nWarren shoots Mobray dead, and he and Mannix then kill Gage. Warren tries to shoot Daisy but is out of bullets. He asks Mannix for his gun, but Mannix refuses, wanting to hear Daisy out. While they argue, Mannix faints from blood loss. Warren watches helplessly as Daisy frees herself by hacking off Ruth's arm. When she goes for a gun, Mannix regains consciousness and wounds her. As Mannix aims for the killing shot, Warren persuades him to hang her in honor of Ruth, who was known as \"The Hangman\" for always bringing his bounties in alive to the [[gallows]]. The two wounded men succeed in stringing Daisy from the [[rafter]]s. As they lie dying, Mannix reads aloud Warren's fake Lincoln letter, complimenting his attention to detail.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|<!-- Names are as-credited and in order; do not change. -->\n* [[Samuel L.

Tarantino said:\n\n{{blockquote|Twice per season, those shows would have an episode where a bunch of outlaws would take the lead characters hostage.

There would be a guest star like [[David Carradine]], [[Darren McGavin]], [[Claude Akins]], [[Robert Culp]], [[Charles Bronson]], or [[James Coburn]]. I don't like that storyline in a modern context, but I love it in a Western, where you would pass halfway through the show to find out if they were good or bad guys, and they all had a past that was revealed. I thought, 'What if I did a movie starring nothing but those characters? No heroes, no [[Michael Landon]]s.
