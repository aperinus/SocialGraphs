It is based on the true story of two British athletes in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]]: [[Eric Liddell]], a devout [[Scottish people|Scottish]] Christian who runs for the glory of God, and [[Harold Abrahams]], an [[English Jew]] who runs to overcome prejudice. [[Ben Cross]] and [[Ian Charleson]] star as Abrahams and Liddell, alongside [[Nigel Havers]], [[Ian Holm]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], [[Cheryl Campbell]], [[Alice Krige]], [[Brad Davis (actor)|Brad Davis]], and [[Dennis Christopher]] in supporting roles. [[Kenneth Branagh]] makes his debut in a minor role.\n\n''Chariots of Fire'' was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]] and won four, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for [[Vangelis]]' [[Chariots of Fire (album)|electronic theme tune]]. At the [[35th British Academy Film Awards]], the film was nominated in eleven categories and won three, including [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]]. It is ranked 19th in the [[British Film Institute]]'s list of [[BFI Top 100 British films|Top 100 British films]].\n\nThe film's title was inspired by the line \"Bring me my Chariot of fire!\" from the [[William Blake]] poem adapted into the British hymn [[And did those feet in ancient time|\"Jerusalem\"]]; the hymn is heard at the end of the film.<ref>Dans, Peter E. [https://books.google.com/books?id=52GpN0Hzxd8C&pg=PA222&q=colin%20welland%20jerusalem%20%22chariots%20of%20fire%22 ''Christians in the Movies: A Century of Saints and Sinners''.] Rowman & Littlefield, 2009. p. 223.</ref> The original phrase \"chariot(s) of fire\" is from [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/2 Kings#2:11|2:11]] and [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/2 Kings#6:17|6:17]] in the Bible.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1919, the Jewish [[Harold Abrahams]] enters the [[University of Cambridge]], where he experiences [[antisemitism]] from the staff but enjoys participating in the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] club. He becomes the first person ever to complete the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Trinity Great Court Run]], running around the college courtyard in the time it takes for the clock to strike 12, and achieves an undefeated string of victories in various national running competitions. Although focused on his running, he falls in love with [[Sybil Gordon]], a leading Gilbert and Sullivan soprano.{{efn|In real-life, Abrahams' was engaged to [[Sybil Evers]], a different Gilbert-and-Sullivan performer.}}\n\n[[Eric Liddell]], born in China to Scottish missionary parents, is in Scotland. His devout sister Jennie disapproves of Liddell's plans to pursue competitive running. Still, Liddell sees running as a way of glorifying God before returning to China to work as a missionary. When they first race against each other, Liddell beats Abrahams. Abrahams takes it poorly, but [[Sam Mussabini]], a professional trainer whom he had approached earlier, offers to take him on to improve his technique. This attracts criticism from the Cambridge college masters, who allege it is not gentlemanly for an amateur to \"play the tradesman\" by employing a professional coach. Abrahams dismisses this concern, interpreting it as cover for antisemitic and class-based prejudice.<!--This is pretty well backed up by Gielgud's character's comments concerning \"a Semite,\" \"a different god\" etc--> When Liddell accidentally misses a church prayer meeting because of his running, Jennie upbraids him and accuses him of no longer caring about God. Eric tells her that though he intends to return eventually to the China mission, he feels divinely inspired when running and that not to run would be to dishonour God.\n\nAfter years of training and racing, the two athletes are accepted to represent Great Britain in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]] in Paris. Also accepted are Abrahams' Cambridge friends, Andrew Lindsay, [[Aubrey Montague]], and Henry Stallard. While boarding the boat to France for the Olympics, Liddell discovers the heats for his 100-metre race will be on a Sunday. Despite intense pressure from the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] and the [[British Olympic Committee]], he refuses to run the race because his Christian convictions prevent him from running on the [[Lord's Day]]. A solution is found thanks to Liddell's teammate Lindsay, who, having already won a silver medal in the [[400 metres hurdles]], offers to give his place in the [[400 metres|400-metre race]] on the following Thursday to Liddell, who gratefully accepts. Liddell's religious convictions in the face of national athletic pride make headlines around the world; he delivers a sermon at the Paris [[Church of Scotland]] that Sunday, and quotes from [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Isaiah#Chapter 40|Isaiah 40]].\n\nAbrahams is badly beaten by the heavily favoured United States runners in the 200 metre race. He knows his last chance for a medal will be the 100 metres. He competes in the race and wins. His coach Mussabini, who was barred from the stadium, is overcome that the years of dedication and training have paid off with an Olympic gold medal. Now Abrahams can get on with his life and reunite with his girlfriend Sybil, whom he had neglected for the sake of running. Before Liddell's race, the American coach remarks dismissively to his runners that Liddell has little chance of doing well in his now, far longer, 400 metre race. But one of the American runners, [[Jackson Scholz]], hands Liddell a note of support that quotes {{Bibleref2|1 Samuel|2:30}}. Liddell defeats the American favourites and wins the gold medal. The British team returns home triumphant.\n\nA textual epilogue reveals that Abrahams married Sybil and became the elder statesman of British athletics while Liddell went on to do missionary work and was mourned by all of Scotland following his death in [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese-occupied China]].\n\n== Cast {{anchor|Main cast}} ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Ben Cross]] as [[Harold Abrahams]], a Jewish student at Cambridge University\n* [[Ian Charleson]] as [[Eric Liddell]], the son of Scottish missionaries to China\n* [[Nigel Havers]] as Lord Andrew Lindsay, a Cambridge student runner (partially based on [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|David Burghley]] and [[Douglas Lowe (athlete)|Douglas Lowe]])\n* [[Nicholas Farrell]] as [[Aubrey Montague]], a runner and friend of Harold Abrahams\n* [[Ian Holm]] as [[Sam Mussabini]], Abrahams' running coach\n* [[John Gielgud]] as Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] at Cambridge University\n* [[Lindsay Anderson]] as Master of [[Caius College]] at Cambridge University\n* [[Cheryl Campbell]] as Jennie Liddell, Eric's devout sister\n* [[Alice Krige]] as [[Sybil Gordon]], a [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|D'Oyly Carte]] soprano and Abrahams' fianc\u00e9e (his actual fianc\u00e9e was [[Sybil Evers]])\n* [[Struan Rodger]] as Sandy McGrath, Liddell's friend and running coach\n* [[Nigel Davenport]] as [[F.

Among other things, he took out advertisements in London newspapers seeking memories of the 1924 Olympics, went to the National Film Archives for pictures and footage of the 1924 Olympics, and interviewed everyone involved who was still alive. Welland just missed Abrahams, who died on 14 January 1978, but he did attend Abrahams' February 1978 memorial service, which inspired the present-day framing device of the film.<ref name=rw /> [[Aubrey Montague]]'s son saw Welland's newspaper ad and sent him copies of the letters his father had sent home \u2013 which gave Welland something to use as a narrative bridge in the film.

Ireland races. Charleson, who had studied the Bible intensively in preparation for the role, told director Hugh Hudson that he didn't feel the portentous and sanctimonious scripted speech was either authentic or inspiring. Hudson and Welland allowed him to write words he personally found inspirational instead.<ref>Ian McKellen, Hugh Hudson, Alan Bates, et al.

Hudson and Puttnam had known each other since the 1960s when Puttnam was an advertising executive and Hudson was making films for ad agencies.

Hudson and producer David Puttnam did months of fruitless searching for the perfect actor to play Eric Liddell. They then saw Scottish stage actor [[Ian Charleson]] performing the role of Pierre in the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s production of ''[[Piaf (play)|Piaf]]'', and knew immediately they had found their man. Unbeknownst to them, Charleson had heard about the film from his father, and desperately wanted to play the part, feeling it would \"fit like a kid glove\".<ref>Ian McKellen, Hugh Hudson, Alan Bates, et al.

This was a departure from earlier period films, which employed sweeping orchestral instrumentals. The [[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|title theme of the film]] has been used in subsequent films and television shows during slow-motion segments.\n\nVangelis, a Greek-born electronic composer who moved to Paris in the late 1960s, had been living in London since 1974.<ref name=\"dt\">{{cite web| url = http://vangeliscollector.com/telegraph112182.htm| title = ''Daily Telegraph'' newspaper, 21 November 1982}}</ref> Director Hugh Hudson had collaborated with him on documentaries and commercials, and was also particularly impressed with his 1979 albums ''[[Opera Sauvage]]'' and ''[[China (Vangelis album)|China]]''.<ref>MacNab, Geoffrey.

One of them is the background music to the race Eric Liddell runs in the Scottish highlands. This piece is a version of \"Hymne\", the original version of which appears on Vangelis's 1979 album, ''[[Op\u00e9ra sauvage]]''. Various versions are also included on Vangelis's compilation albums ''[[Themes (Vangelis album)|Themes]]'', ''[[Portraits (So Long Ago, So Clear)|Portraits]]'', and ''[[Odyssey: The Definitive Collection]]'', though none of these include the version used in the film.\n\nFive lively [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] tunes also appear in the soundtrack, and serve as jaunty period music which counterpoints Vangelis's modern electronic score. These are: \"He is an Englishman\" from ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', \"Three Little Maids from School Are We\" from ''[[The Mikado]]'', \"With Catlike Tread\" from ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', \"The Soldiers of Our Queen\" from ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', and \"There Lived a King\" from ''[[The Gondoliers]]''.\n\nThe film also incorporates a major traditional work: \"[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]\", sung by a British choir at the 1978 funeral of Harold Abrahams.

B. Stallard|Henry Stallard]], [[Aubrey Montague]], and Lord Andrew Lindsay. Abrahams and Stallard were in fact students there and competed in the 1924 Olympics. Montague also competed in the Olympics as depicted, but he attended Oxford, not Cambridge.<ref name=aubrey>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200418035510/https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/mo/evelyn-montague-1.html Aubrey Montague biography] at SportsReference.com</ref> Aubrey Montague sent daily letters to his mother about his time at Oxford and the Olympics; these letters were the basis of Montague's narration in the film.\n\nThe character of Lindsay was based partially on [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Lord Burghley]], a significant figure in the history of British athletics. Although Burghley did attend Cambridge, he was not a contemporary of Harold Abrahams, as Abrahams was an undergraduate from 1919 to 1923 and Burghley was at Cambridge from 1923 to 1927. One scene in the film depicts the Burghley-based \"Lindsay\" as practising hurdles on his estate with full champagne glasses placed on each hurdle \u2013 this was something the wealthy Burghley did, although he used matchboxes instead of champagne glasses.<ref name=rw /> The fictional character of Lindsay was created when [[Douglas Lowe (athlete)|Douglas Lowe]], who was Britain's third athletics gold medallist in the 1924 Olympics, was not willing to be involved with the film.{{sfn|Chapman|2005| pp= 275, 295}}\n\n[[File:Cross and Havers.jpg|thumb|right|[[Harold Abrahams|Abrahams]] (left) and the [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Burghley]]-based Lindsay (right) attempt the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Great Court Run]].]]\nAnother scene in the film recreates the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Great Court Run]], in which the runners attempt to run around the perimeter of the [[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in the time it takes the clock to strike 12 at midday. The film shows Abrahams performing the feat for the first time in history. In fact, Abrahams never attempted this race, and at the time of filming the only person on record known to have succeeded was [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Lord Burghley]], in 1927. In ''Chariots of Fire'', Lindsay, who is based on Lord Burghley, runs the Great Court Run with Abrahams in order to spur him on, and crosses the finish line just a moment too late. Since the film's release, the Great Court Run has also been successfully run by Trinity undergraduate Sam Dobin, in October 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-record-idUKL276510720071027|title=Student runs away with \"Chariots of Fire\" record|date=27 October 2007|work=Reuters|access-date=1 May 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the film, Eric Liddell is tripped up by a Frenchman in the 400-metre event of a Scotland\u2013France international athletic meeting. He recovers, makes up a 20-metre deficit, and wins. This was based on fact; the actual race was the 440 yards at a Triangular Contest meet between Scotland, England, and Ireland at [[Stoke-on-Trent]] in England in July 1923. His achievement was remarkable as he had already won the 100- and 220-yard events that day.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=Russell W.|title=God's Joyful Runner|publisher=Bridge Publishing, Inc|year=1987|page=[https://archive.org/details/godsjoyfulrunner0000rams/page/54 54]|isbn=0-88270-624-1|url=https://archive.org/details/godsjoyfulrunner0000rams/page/54}}</ref> Also unmentioned with regard to Liddell is that it was he who introduced Abrahams to [[Sam Mussabini]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0019/ |title=A Sporting Nation: Eric Liddell |work=BBC.co.uk|access-date=13 March 2012}}</ref> This is alluded to: In the film Abrahams first encounters Mussabini while he is watching Liddell race.\n\nAbrahams and Liddell did race against each other twice, but not as depicted in the film, which shows Liddell winning the final of the 100 yards against a shattered Abrahams at the 1923 AAA Championship at Stamford Bridge. In fact, they raced only in a heat of the 220 yards, which Liddell won, five yards ahead of Abrahams, who did not progress to the final. In the 100 yards, Abrahams was eliminated in the heats and did not race against Liddell, who won the finals of both races the next day. They also raced against each other in the 200 m final at the 1924 Olympics, and this was also not shown in the film.<ref>{{cite book|last=McCasland|first=David|title=Pure Gold: A New Biography of the Olympic Champion Who Inspired Chariots of Fire|publisher=Discovery House|year=2001|isbn=1572931302}}</ref>\n\nAbrahams' fianc\u00e9e is misidentified as [[Sybil Gordon]], a soprano with the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].

Her disapproval of Liddell's track career was creative licence; she actually fully supported his sporting work. Jenny Liddell Somerville cooperated fully with the making of the film and has a brief cameo in the Paris [[Church of Scotland]] during Liddell's sermon.<ref>Ramsey, Russell W.

However, Montague died in 1948, 30 years before Abrahams' death.\n\n=== Paris Olympics 1924 ===\n{{see also|Great Britain at the 1924 Summer Olympics}}\nIn the film, the 100m bronze medallist is a character called \"Tom Watson\"; the real medallist was [[Arthur Porritt, Baron Porritt|Arthur Porritt]] of New Zealand, who refused permission for his name to be used in the film, allegedly out of modesty, and his wish was accepted by the film's producers, even though his permission was not necessary.<ref>{{cite web |author=Arthur Espie Porritt 1900\u20131994 |url=http://www.library.otago.ac.nz/exhibitions/rhodes_scholars/arthur_espie_porritt.html |title=Reference to Porritt's modesty |publisher=Library.otago.ac.nz |access-date=28 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051030185734/http://www.library.otago.ac.nz/exhibitions/rhodes_scholars/arthur_espie_porritt.html |archive-date=30 October 2005 |url-status=dead}}</ref> However, the brief back-story given for Watson, who is called up to the New Zealand team from the [[University of Oxford]], substantially matches Porritt's history. With the exception of Porritt, all the runners in the 100m final are identified correctly when they line up for inspection by the Prince of Wales.\n\nJackson Scholz is depicted as handing Liddell an inspirational Bible-quotation message before the 400 metres final: \"It says in the Old Book, 'He that honors me, I will honor.' Good luck.\"<ref>The quoted passage is [[Books of Samuel|First Samuel]] [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Samuel#2:30|2:30]].</ref> In reality, the note was from members of the British team, and was handed to Liddell before the race by his attending masseur at the team's Paris hotel.<ref name=reid>Reid, Alasdair. \"Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell\".

In the film, he does not learn that the 100-metre heat is to be held on the Christian Sabbath until he is boarding the boat to Paris. In fact, the schedule was made public several months in advance; Liddell did however face immense pressure to run on that Sunday and to compete in the 100 metres, getting called before a grilling by the British Olympic Committee, the Prince of Wales, and other [[grandee]]s,<ref name=hudson/> and his refusal to run made headlines around the world.<ref>Murray, Feg. [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/361517352.html?dids=361517352:361517352&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Jun+24%2C+1924&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=DID+YOU+KNOW+THAT--&pqatl=google \"DID YOU KNOW THAT ...\"]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. 24 June 1924. Full headline reads, \"Did You Know That Famous Scotch Sprinter Will Not Run in the Olympic 100 Metres Because The Trials Are Run on Sunday\".</ref>\n\nThe decision to change races was, even so, made well before embarking to Paris, and Liddell spent the intervening months training for the 400 metres, an event in which he had previously excelled. It is true, nonetheless, that Liddell's success in the Olympic 400m was largely unexpected.\n\nThe film depicts Lindsay, having already won a medal in the 400-metre hurdles, giving up his place in the 400-metre race for Liddell. In fact [[David Burghley|Burghley]], on whom Lindsay is loosely based, was eliminated in the heats of the 110 hurdles (he would go on to win a gold medal in the 400 hurdles at the 1928 Olympics), and was not entered for the 400 metres.\n\nThe film reverses the order of Abrahams' 100m and 200m races at the Olympics. In reality, after winning the 100 metres race, Abrahams ran the [[200 metres]] but finished last, [[Jackson Scholz]] taking the gold medal. In the film, before his triumph in the 100m, Abrahams is shown losing the 200m and being scolded by Mussabini. And during the following scene in which Abrahams speaks with his friend Montague while receiving a massage from Mussabini, there is a French newspaper clipping showing Scholz and [[Charley Paddock]] with a headline which states that the 200 metres was a triumph for the United States. In the same conversation, Abrahams laments getting \"beaten out of sight\" in the 200. The film thus has Abrahams overcoming the disappointment of losing the 200 by going on to win the 100, a reversal of the real order.\n\nEric Liddell actually also ran in the 200m race, and finished third, behind Paddock and Scholz. This was the only time in reality that Liddell and Abrahams competed in the same finals race. While their meeting in the 1923 [[Amateur Athletic Association|AAA]] Championship in the film was fictitious, Liddell's record win in that race did spur Abrahams to train even harder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.ericliddell.org/ericliddell/recollections/content/arthurmarshall.htm |title=Recollections by Sir Arthur Marshall |publisher=Content.ericliddell.org |access-date=28 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215092135/http://content.ericliddell.org/ericliddell/recollections/content/arthurmarshall.htm |archive-date=15 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAbrahams also won a silver medal as an opening runner for the [[4 x 100 metres relay]] team, not shown in the film, and [[Aubrey Montague]] placed sixth in the [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]], as depicted.<ref name=aubrey />\n\n== London Olympics' 2012 revival ==\n''Chariots of Fire'' became a recurring theme in promotions for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London.
