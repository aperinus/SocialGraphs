The film was screened at the [[Los Angeles Film Festival|Los Angeles Independent Film Festival]] on April 14, 2000, and received a limited release in the United States on November 1, 2002. It is based on an [[O. Henry Award]]-winning short story by author [[Tom McNeal]].\n\nOriginally titled ''The Truth About Tully'', the film changed its name to avoid confusion with [[Jonathan Demme]]'s ''[[The Truth About Charlie]]''.<ref name=\"turan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-kenny1nov01,0,791096.story|title=Tully|last=Turan|first=Kenneth|date=November 1, 2002|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=April 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story centers on the Coates brothers, Tully and Earl, who live on their father's ranch in rural [[Nebraska]]. Their mother abandoned the family when the boys were young. Tully is very outgoing and has relationships with many women, including a stripper named April. Earl is more of an introvert.\n\nElla, a childhood friend of both Coates brothers, comes back to town to start a veterinary practice. Ella appears to have more in common with Earl, as she is reserved and not the typical woman that Tully dates. Yet, they start a relationship.\n\nThe elder Coates, Tully Sr., clearly misses his wife and as the film develops, his financial problems worsen. It is eventually shown that his financial problems are due to his wife's medical bills (he never got a divorce). Tully Sr. dies ambiguously. The film's climax shows how the brothers and Ella react to this tragic event.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Glenn Fitzgerald]] as Earl Coates\n* [[Anson Mount]] as Tully Russell Coates Jr.\n* Bob Burrus as Tully Russell Coates Sr.\n* [[Julianne Nicholson]] as Ella Smalley\n* [[Catherine Kellner]] as April Reece\n* Laura Walker as Wendy Adams\n* Tim Driscoll as Clarence Heiting\n* [[Kristopher King]] as Dexter\n* Delaney Driscoll as Mrs. Smalley\n* [[John Diehl]] as Mal \"Mac\" MacAvoy\n}}\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe film develops with a very slow pace, and ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Stephen Holden]] praises this in his review:\n\n<blockquote>\nAs deliberately paced as a late-afternoon amble around a homestead, the movie occasionally stops in its tracks to take a deep breath and soak in more of the rural atmosphere. Although this tendency to dawdle may frustrate viewers accustomed to a barrage of visual stimulation, the movie's unhurried rhythm eventually works a quiet spell, and after a while you find yourself settling back, adjusting to the film's bucolic metabolism and appreciating its eye and ear for detail.<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/01/movies/01TULL.html|title=A Troubled Family's Farm, Where Fate Comes Calling|last=Holden|first=Stephen|date=November 1, 2002|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-04-15}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nHolden also compliments the acting, particularly that of Nicholson, whom he describes as \"luminous in an utterly natural way\".<ref name=\"nyt\" /> [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' also commends the film's pace, stating that the \"deliberate speed goes hand in hand with its unmistakable sense of place, its attraction to the rhythms of farm life and the unhurried sensibility of its small-town Nebraska setting\".<ref name=\"turan\" />\n\n[[Lisa Schwarzbaum]] of ''Entertainment Weekly'' gave the film a B+ rating, and writes, \"the believable young people growing on this plot of soil are never predictable; neither are the unmannered, affecting performances\".<ref name=\"ew\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,388456,00.html|title=Tully (2002)|last=Schwarzbaum|first=Lisa|date=November 15, 2002|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=April 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\n''Tully'' has an approval rating of 81% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 52 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tully/ |title=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=September 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
