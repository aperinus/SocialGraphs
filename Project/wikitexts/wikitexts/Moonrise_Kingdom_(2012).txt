Largely set on the fictional island of New Penzance somewhere off the coast of [[New England]], it tells the story of an orphan boy (Gilman) who escapes from a scouting camp to unite with his pen pal and love interest, a girl with aggressive tendencies (Hayward). Feeling alienated from their guardians and shunned by their peers, the lovers abscond to an isolated beach. Meanwhile, the island's police captain (Willis) organizes a search party of scouts and family members to locate the runaways.\n\nIn crafting their screenplay, Anderson and Coppola drew from personal experiences and memories of childhood fantasies as well as films including ''[[Melody (1971 film)|Melody]]'' (1971) and ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (1959). Auditions for [[child actor]]s took eight months, and filming took place in [[Rhode Island]] over three months in 2011.\n\n''Moonrise Kingdom'' premiered at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]] and received critical acclaim, with its themes of young love, [[child sexuality]], juvenile mental health, and the [[Genesis flood narrative]] being praised. Critics cited the film's color palette and use of visual symmetry as well as the use of original composition by [[Alexandre Desplat]] to supplement existing music by [[Benjamin Britten]]. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe for Best Musical or Comedy]]. In 2016, the [[BBC]] included the film in its [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century|list of greatest films of the twenty-first century]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should remain between 400-700 words. Work within the limit and DO NOT ADD -->\nOn the [[New England]] island of New Penzance, 12-year-old orphan Sam Shakusky attends Camp Ivanhoe, a Khaki Scout summer camp led by [[Scout leader|Scout Master]] Randy Ward. Suzy Bishop, also 12, lives on the island with her parents Walt and Laura, both lawyers, and her three younger brothers in a house called Summer's End.\n\nSam and Suzy, both introverted, intelligent, and mature for their age, meet in the summer of 1964 during a church performance of ''[[Noye's Fludde]]'' and become [[pen pal]]s. The relationship becomes romantic over the course of their correspondence, and they make a secret pact to reunite and run away together. In September 1965, they execute their plan. Sam escapes from Camp Ivanhoe while Suzy runs away from Summer's End. The pair rendezvous, hike, camp, and fish in the wilderness with the goal of reaching a specific location.\n\nMeanwhile, the Khaki Scouts have become aware of Sam's absence, finding a letter he left behind stating he has resigned his position as a Khaki Scout. Scout Master Ward tells the Khaki Scouts to use their skills to set up a search party and find Sam. Island Police Captain Duffy Sharp and Ward contact Sam's guardians the Billingsleys and learn they are actually his foster parents and Sam is an orphan with a history of behavioral issues in the home.\n\nEventually, a group of Khaki Scouts confronts Sam and Suzy and tries to capture them. During the resulting altercation, Suzy injures the Scouts' de facto leader Redford with a pair of scissors and a stray arrow fired by one of the Scouts kills Camp Ivanhoe's dog Snoopy. The Scouts flee, and Sam and Suzy hike to Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet which they name \"Moonrise Kingdom.\" They set up camp and as the romantic tension between them grows, they dance on the beach and share each other's first kiss.\n\nSuzy's parents, Ward, the Scouts from Camp Ivanhoe, and Sharp finally find Sam and Suzy in their tent. Suzy's parents take her home. Ward gives Sam a letter from the Billingsleys stating that they no longer wish to house Sam. He stays with Sharp while they await the arrival of a Social Services worker, who will likely place Sam in an orphanage and possibly treat him with [[electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]].\n\nWhile in their treehouse, the Camp Ivanhoe Scouts have a change of heart and decide to help Suzy and Sam. Together, they paddle to neighboring St. Jack Wood Island to seek out the help of Ben, an older cousin of the scout Skotak. Ben works at Fort Lebanon, a larger Khaki Scout summer camp on St. Jack Wood Island run by Ward's superior, Commander Pierce.\n\nBen decides to try to take Sam and Suzy to a crabbing boat anchored off the island so that Sam can work as a crewman and avoid Social Services. He performs a \"wedding\" ceremony, which he admits is not legally binding before they leave. Sam and Suzy never make it onto the crabbing boat, and her parents, Captain Sharp, Social Services, and the scouts of Fort Lebanon under the command of Scout Master Ward pursue them instead.\n\nA violent hurricane and flash flood strike, and Sharp apprehends Sam and Suzy on the steeple of the church in which they first met. Lightning destroys the steeple, but Sharp saves them. During the storm, he decides to become Sam's legal guardian. The hurricane erases Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet from the map.\n\nAt Summer's End, Sam is upstairs painting a landscape of Moonrise Kingdom. Suzy and her brothers are called to dinner, while Sam slips out of the window to join Sharp in his patrol car, telling Suzy he will see her the following day.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDirector Wes Anderson had long been interested in depicting a romance between children.<ref name=\"Clarke\">{{cite web |last=Clarke |first=Cath |title=Wes Anderson interview |url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/wes-anderson-interview-2 |work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |date=2012 |access-date=May 11, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512112214/https://www.timeout.com/london/film/wes-anderson-interview-2 |archive-date=May 12, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> He described the starting idea for the story as a memory of fantasized young love:\n{{Blockquote|I remember this feeling, from when I was that age and from when I was in fifth grade, but nothing really happened.
