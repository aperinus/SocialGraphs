The film is a [[sequel]] to ''[[Casper: A Spirited Beginning]]'', and is the second [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]/[[prequel]] of ''[[Casper (film)|Casper]]''. Saban Entertainment, co-produced the project. The film also marks the second ''Casper'' film to co-star [[Cathy Moriarty]], who played the villainess in the 1995 film.\n\nThis was the first major film for [[Hilary Duff]], who was 10 years old when the film was released on September 22, 1998, six days before her 11th birthday, and was met with mostly negative reviews from critics, but was considered an improvement to its predecessor. Its television premiere was October 24, 1999 on [[Television networks preceding ABC Family#Fox Family|Fox Family]].\n\n==Plot==\nA mysterious object floats over a baseball game eventually revealing Stretch, Stinkie, and Fatso, [[Ghostly Trio|the Ghostly Trio]], who cause panic in the ballpark. Their nephew [[Casper the Friendly Ghost|Casper]] attempts to settle the terrified crowd, but they are just as scared of him. The park empties, and after watching their effect with satisfaction, Casper's uncles plan a vacation.\n\nMeanwhile, a malevolent warlock named Desmond Spellman believes himself to be the greatest warlock to have existed until he receives an unwelcome message from the Oracle in the Mirror, who tells him that in the future, none other than [[Wendy the Good Little Witch]] will surpass him. To avoid this, Desmond plans to get rid of her once and for all with the advised \"Mystic Abyss\", a dimensional rift that can destroy living beings. He then creates a pair of spies: Jules and Vincent, and assigns them to bring Wendy to him where she is living in the country with her three mischievous aunts: Gert, Gabby, and Fanny.\n\nJules and Vincent arrive at Wendy's house to escort the young witch to Desmond, but she narrowly escapes with her aunts. To keep Wendy safe from Desmond, her aunts hide and vacation at a resort hotel which happens to be the same place in which Casper and his uncles are vacationing. Casper and Wendy meet in a barn and become great friends. Unfortunately, they fear that their guardians will not get along because ghosts and witches are natural enemies. In order to make the guardians get along, Casper and Wendy devise a plan to make them meet at a party. Casper gets the Ghostly Trio to possess three men who happen to resemble them. Wendy convinces her aunts to go to the party to meet men. Thanks to their plotting, they meet and soon the Trio are flirting with the three witches, who are posing as regular women.\n\nThough everything goes well at first, the plan is spoiled when the possession wears off and the Trio's real selves are revealed to Wendy's aunts, who, in turn, reveal their real selves and threaten them with magic. However, as Wendy explains to Casper, she and her aunts cannot use any high-level magic or else Desmond will be able to track them down. She begs Casper not to tell anyone about this, but when the Trio suspects that Casper is protecting the witches, they pressure him into blurting out that the witches cannot use their powers, prompting the Trio to terrorize Wendy and her aunts. Wendy feels she has no choice but to cast a high-level spell to cover the Trio in plaster, thus alerting Desmond of her location.\n\nDistraught that Casper broke his promise, Wendy ends their friendship. Casper soon confronts his uncles and tells them that Desmond is coming after the witches and they should help, at which the Trio scoff and refuse. Before the witches can evacuate the resort, Desmond and his spies arrive. After finding and confronting the witches, Desmond explains the Oracle's prediction, and after she tries to resist him, summons the Mystic Abyss and casts Wendy into it, with Casper diving inside in an attempt to rescue her. Wendy's aunts battle Desmond but are no match for him. Before Desmond can turn the witches into fertilizer, a giant three-eyed monster appears and frightens the warlock who trips over Wendy's broom and falls into the Abyss himself. The monster turns out to be the Ghostly Trio, who had a change of heart. While they hold the door to the Abyss open, Wendy's aunts pull her and Casper out.\n\nBoth Casper and Wendy are unconscious from being inside the Abyss; but with encouragement and comfort from their guardians, Casper is restored by his uncles, and Wendy is treated by her aunts. After a touching reunion between the witches and an awkward one between the ghosts, the witches thank the Trio for helping them. The Oracle then proclaims that Wendy is the greatest witch because she did something no other witch ever could; she befriended a ghost. Later, Casper, his uncles, Wendy, and her aunts, all bid each other goodbye. Before flying back home with her aunts, Wendy gives Casper a goodbye kiss, causing him to blush.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Main===\n====Live-action====\n* [[Hilary Duff]] as [[Wendy the Good Little Witch]]\n* [[Cathy Moriarty]] as Gert\n* [[Shelley Duvall]] as Gabby\n* [[Teri Garr]] as Fanny\n* [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] as Desmond Spellman\n* [[Richard Moll]] as Jules\n* [[Vincent Schiavelli]] as Vincent\n* [[Pauly Shore]] as The Oracle\n* [[Blake Foster]] as Josh Jackman\n* Logan Robbins as Logan\n* [[Michael McDonald (comedian)|Michael McDonald]] as Spike-Stretch\n* Travis McKenna as Phil-Fatso\n* Patrick Richwood as Vinne-Stinkie\n\n====Voice====\n* [[Jeremy Foley (actor)|Jeremy Foley]] as [[Casper the Friendly Ghost]]\n* [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]] as Stretch\n* [[Bill Farmer]] as Stinkie\n* [[Jess Harnell]] as Fatso\n\n===Supporting===\n* [[Norm Macdonald]] as Human Stretch\n* Rodger Halston as Larry Tullby\n* [[Alan Thicke]] as Baseball Announcer\n* [[Casper Van Dien]] as Crewcut Hunk\n* [[Billy Burnette]] as Chef\n* [[Maria Ford]] as Playmate (Fanny)\n* [[Ben Stein]] as Lawyer (Uncredited)\n* Jim Jackman as Jerry Jackman\n* Sheila Travis as Jean Jackman\n* Clay Crosby as Honeycakes\n* Tamie Lea Logan as Squeekums (Credited as Tami Logan)\n* Ramsey Krull as Newsboy\n* Paul Di Franco as Spectator (Credited as Paul di Franco)\n* Howie Gold as Agitated Fan\n* Charles Moore as Amazed Fan\n* Emily Jennifer Grunfeld as Pretty Fan\n* Manny Fernandez as Handsome Fan\n* Michael Spagnoli as Panicked Fan\n* [[Jim Wise]] as Hungry Fan\n* Ricky Luna as Catcher\n* John Rizzi as Cubana Boy\n* Sebastian Hitzig as Desk Clerk\n* [[Patricia Elliott]] as Snotty Woman (Credited as Pat Elliot)\n* Sue Ellen Enright as Maid\n* Cecile Krevoy as Snooty Lady\n* [[Rodman Flender]] as Agile Dancer\n* Michelle Marie as Rockin' Dancer\n* Lisa Salazar as Smart Dancer\n* [[Elizabeth Gage]] as Swift Dancer\n* Karen Welch as Spinning Dancer\n* Rick Dean as Table Occupant\n* Lacey Taylor Robbins as Kim\n* [[Larry Robbins]] as Boogie-Lovin' Dude\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Casper Meets Wendy'' received mostly negative reviews from critics, with a total of 6 reviews from critics on the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 17% gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 4.05/10, which gives the film a slight improvement over its predecessor, but still low compared to the 1995 theatrical film.<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/casper_meets_wendy|title=Casper Meets Wendy |accessdate=July 5, 2020|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack alteration==\nIn the original airing and VHS release of the film, the Casper theme can be heard in the opening sequence performed by Shana Halligan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shana Halligan - Casper the Friendly Ghost (with lyric)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuI53sRblW8 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/ZuI53sRblW8| archive-date=2021-12-12 |url-status=live|website=You Tube|accessdate=2 March 2018}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In the subsequent DVD releases the lyric is muted though the melody and sound effects remain intact.
