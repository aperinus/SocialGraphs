They idolize 90's hip hop music and fashion. Malcolm is confident he will be admitted to his dream school, [[Harvard University]], but his [[school counselor]] is skeptical and suggests he take an interview with local businessman and Harvard alumnus, Austin Jacoby.\n\nWhile biking home, Malcolm is stopped by Dom, a drug dealer who instructs him to invite a girl named Nakia to his party. Malcolm charms Nakia, who tells him she will only accept if Malcolm goes as well. Jib and Diggy accompany Malcolm to the party, where Dom\u2019s  purchase of high-grade, powdered [[MDMA|molly]] is interrupted by an armed gang, and several people are shot. Malcolm escapes as the police arrive, unaware that Dom has hidden the drugs and a gun in his backpack. Nakia drives Malcolm home, and he offers to help her with her [[General Educational Development|GED]].\n\nThe next day, Malcolm discovers the drugs, gun, and an [[iPhone]]. An unknown caller reveals that he knows Malcolm's identity, and instructs him to turn over the drugs. After school, Malcolm prepares to hand over the drugs when he receives a call from Dom, in custody, who tells Malcolm not to give the drugs to the other caller. He texts Malcolm an address and tells him to ask for AJ.\n\nMalcolm, Jib and Diggy flee to the address, chased by the unknown caller, and are greeted by Jaleel and his sister Lily. Since AJ, their father, isn't home, Jaleel invites them inside their mansion and takes Jib and Diggy out for food, while Lily seduces Malcolm, finds the drugs and takes a heavy dose. Intoxicated, Lily passes out while driving Malcolm to his interview before urinating on a bush while bystanders record, and Malcolm drives her car to the meeting himself.\n\nArriving at Jacoby's office, he notices photos of Dom, Lily, and Jaleel and realizes Jacoby is AJ. Malcolm relays Dom's instructions to Jacoby, who denies any knowledge and implies that the contents of the bag are now Malcolm's responsibility. Jacoby reschedules the interview, warning Malcolm that if he has not sold the drugs by then, he will not receive Jacoby\u2019s recommendation to Harvard.\n\nMalcolm, Jib and Diggy seek help from hacker Will Sherwood, who sets up an online black-market website to sell the drugs through [[Bitcoin]] transactions, which soon goes viral. The three friends enroll in a [[Google Science Fair]] project to access the school lab and computer room, where they can sell the drugs to the various buyers. Even though no one suspects them, they almost get caught one day during a routine police search. This episode frightens Jib who wants to leave, but eventually accepts to go on to finish the sales.\n\nMalcolm helps Nakia study, and she opens up to him, but he accuses her of being sent by Dom  and pushes her away. The next day, Malcolm asks Will to extract cash from the Bitcoins, and arranges a meeting with a money-laundering gangster named Fidel. Malcolm leaves the meeting with a bag of cash, but is assaulted by the school bully, who takes the bag. Desperate, Malcolm pulls out the gun, retrieving the money and earning the bully's respect.\n\nReturning to AJ's office, Malcolm tells Jacoby that he has sold the drugs but has left a trail leading to Jacoby \u2013 unless Jacoby gets him admitted to Harvard, Malcolm will transfer the Bitcoins to Jacoby's checking account, incriminating Jacoby for the sale and leading to his arrest. Later Malcolm types his college application essay, describing two students \u2013 Student A is a music geek who plays in a punk band and gets straight As, while Student B suffers in the hood and makes money in immoral ways. He asks, \"Which student do you think I am?\"\n\nMalcolm gets a modern hair cut and waits for Nakia at [[prom]], but she does not show. Later, Nakia meets Malcolm at his home and thanks him for helping her pass her GED, giving him a pass to [[Six Flags]] and kissing him on the cheek. He returns to his room to find a [[College admissions in the United States#Acceptances and rejections|letter]] from Harvard on his bed. He opens it and [[Fourth wall|looks at the audience]] before smiling.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shameik Moore]] as Malcolm Adekanbi\n* [[Tony Revolori]] as James \"Jib\" Caldones\n* [[Kiersey Clemons]] as Cassandra \"Diggy\" Andrews\n* [[Kimberly Elise]] as Lisa Hayes\n* [[Chanel Iman]] as Lily Jacoby\n* [[Blake Anderson]] as Will Sherwood\n* [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] as Nakia\n* [[ASAP Rocky]] as Dom\n* [[Lakeith Stanfield]] as Marquis \"Bug\"\n* [[Rick Fox]] as Councilman Blackmon\n* [[Amin Joseph]] as The Voice\n* [[Tyga]] as De'Andre\n* [[Roger Guenveur Smith]] as Austin Jacoby \n* [[De'Aundre Bonds]] as Stacey, the school security guard, reprising his character from ''[[The Wood]]''\n* [[Quincy (actor)|Quincy Brown]] as Jaleel Jacoby\n* [[Kap-G]] as Micheal Fidel\n* [[Vince Staples]] as a member of Dom's Crew\n* [[Casey Veggies]] as rapper\n* [[Wyking Jones]] as Proctor\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as the Narrator\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Anchor|Music|Score|Soundtrack}}\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Dope<br>(Music From The Motion Picture)\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = Various\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = June 16, 2015\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film soundtrack]]\n| length     =\n| label      = [[i am OTHER|i am OTHER Entertainment]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\nThe soundtrack to the film, ''Dope (Music from the Motion Picture)'', was released by [[i am OTHER|i am OTHER Entertainment]] and [[Columbia Records]] on June 16, 2015.<ref>{{cite web| first=Sean |last=Fitz-Gerald |url=https://www.vulture.com/2015/06/details-of-pharrells-dope-soundtrack.html |title=The Details of Pharrell's Dope Soundtrack |website=Vulture.com |access-date=2015-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6590202/dope-movie-soundtrack-awreeoh-pharrell-williams |title=The 'Dope' Soundtrack Is Awesome, Starting With This Hilarious Pharrell-Produced Song |website=Billboard.com |access-date=2015-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/dope-music-from-motion-picture/id1000798153 |title=Dope (Music from the Motion Picture) by Various Artists |publisher= Itunes.Apple.com |date=2015-06-15 |access-date=2015-08-16}}</ref>\n\n<!-- See [[Template:Track listing]] to improve this section -->\n# \"[[Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat)]]\" \u2013 [[Digable Planets]]\n# \"Can't Bring Me Down\" \u2013 Awreeoh\n# \"[[The World Is Yours (Nas song)|The World is Yours]]\" (feat.
