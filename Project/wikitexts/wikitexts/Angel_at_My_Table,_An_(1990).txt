Originally produced as a television [[mini-series]], the film, as with Frame's autobiographies, is divided into three sections, with the lead role played by three actresses who portray Frame at different stages of her life: Alexia Keogh (child), Karen Fergusson (teenager), and [[Kerry Fox]] (adult). The film follows Frame from when she grows up in a poor family, through her years in a mental institution, and into her writing years after her escape.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Kerry Fox]] as Janet Frame (adult)\n*Alexia Keogh as Janet Frame (child)\n*Karen Fergusson as Janet Frame (teenager)\n*Iris Churn as Mother\n*[[Kevin J.
