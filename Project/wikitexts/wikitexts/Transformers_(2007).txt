The film, which combines [[computer animation]] with [[live-action]] filming, was directed by [[Michael Bay]], with [[Steven Spielberg]] serving as executive producer. It was produced by [[Don Murphy]] and [[Tom DeSanto]], and is the first installment in the live-action [[Transformers (film series)|''Transformers'' film series]]. \n\nThe film stars [[Shia LaBeouf]] as [[Sam Witwicky]], a teenager who gets caught up in a war between the heroic [[Autobot]]s and the villainous [[Decepticon]]s, two factions of alien robots who can disguise themselves by transforming into everyday machinery, primarily [[vehicle]]s. The Autobots intend to retrieve and use the AllSpark, the powerful artifact that created their robotic race that is on Earth, to rebuild their home planet Cybertron and end the war, while the Decepticons have the intention of using it to build an army by giving life to the machines of Earth. [[Tyrese Gibson]], [[Josh Duhamel]], [[Anthony Anderson]], [[Megan Fox]], [[Rachael Taylor]], [[John Turturro]], and [[Jon Voight]] also star, while voice actors [[Peter Cullen]] and [[Hugo Weaving]] voice [[Optimus Prime]] and [[Megatron]] respectively.\n\nMurphy was initially interested in developing a G.I. Joe film, but then decided to develop a Transformers film after the United States [[Iraq War|went to war against Iraq in 2003]]. Murphy and DeSanto developed the project in 2003, and DeSanto wrote a [[film treatment|treatment]]. Steven Spielberg came on board the following year, hiring [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]] to write the screenplay. The [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]] and [[General Motors]] (GM) loaned vehicles and aircraft during filming, which saved money for the production and added realism to the battle scenes. Hasbro's promotional campaign for the film included deals with various companies; advertising included a [[viral marketing]] campaign, coordinated releases of [[Transformers: Movie Prequel|prequel comic books]], toys, and books, as well as [[product placement]] deals with companies such as [[General Motors|GM]], [[Burger King]], and [[eBay]].\n\n''Transformers'' was released theatrically in the United States on July 3, 2007. The film became the [[2007 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth highest-grossing film of 2007]], grossing $709 million worldwide, with an estimated 46 million tickets sold in the US. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the visual effects, musical score, action sequences, LaBeouf's performance, and Peter Cullen's reprisal as Optimus Prime, while criticism aimed at the Transformer redesigns, the screen time for certain characters, and use of product placement. The film won four awards from the [[Visual Effects Society]] and was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]], for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. The film was followed by four sequels: ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Revenge of the Fallen]]'' (2009), ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon|Dark of the Moon]]'' (2011), ''[[Transformers: Age of Extinction|Age of Extinction]]'' (2014), and ''[[Transformers: The Last Knight|The Last Knight]]'' (2017), as well as a spin-off titled ''[[Bumblebee (film)|Bumblebee]]'' (2018). A seventh installment, ''[[Transformers: Rise of the Beasts|Rise of the Beasts]]'', is scheduled to be released in 2023.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->\nThousands of years ago, the planet Cybertron was consumed by a [[civil war]] between the two [[Transformers|Transformer]] factions, the [[Autobots]] led by [[Optimus Prime]] and the [[Decepticon]]s led by [[Megatron]]. The Autobots want to find the All Spark, the source of all Cybertronian life, so they can use it to rebuild Cybertron and end the war, while the Decepticons want to use it to defeat the Autobots and conquer the universe. Megatron found the All Spark on Earth, but crash-landed in the [[Arctic Circle]] and was frozen in the ice. [[Witwicky family#Captain Archibald|Captain Archibald Witwicky]] and his crew of explorers stumbled upon Megatron in 1897. Captain Witwicky accidentally activates Megatron's navigational system, causing his eyeglasses to be imprinted with the coordinates of the All Spark's location. Sector 7, a secret United States government organization, discovers the All Spark in the [[Colorado River]] and builds the [[Hoover Dam]] around it to mask its energy emissions. The still-frozen Megatron is moved into this facility and is [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] to advance human technology.\n\nIn the present day, the Decepticons\u2014[[Blackout (Transformers)|Blackout]], [[Scorponok]], [[Frenzy (Transformers)|Frenzy]], [[Barricade (Transformers)|Barricade]], [[Starscream]], [[Brawl (Transformers)|Brawl]]<!--PLEASE NOTE!!, the original release referred to him as \"Devastator\" not \"Brawl\"!--> and [[Bonecrusher (Transformers)|Bonecrusher]]\u2014have landed on Earth and assumed the disguise of Earth vehicles plus have setup a conspiracy. Blackout and Scorponok attack the U.S. [[United States Special Operations Command Central|SOCCENT]] military base in [[Qatar]] and try to [[Hack (computer security)|hack]] into the U.S. military network to find the location of Megatron and the All Spark. Their mission is thwarted when the base staff severs the network cable connections. While Blackout destroys the rest of the base, Scorponok chases a small group of survivors who have photographic evidence of the robots, but he is eventually repelled. During this battle, the military discovers its only effective weapons against the Transformers' armor are high-heat [[Sabot (firearms)|sabot]] rounds.\n\nAfter Blackout's failure, Frenzy infiltrates [[Air Force One]] to try again to hack into the military network, and in doing so plants a virus. He finds the map imprinted on Captain Witwicky's glasses, whose descendant, Sam Witwicky, intends to sell on [[eBay]]. Frenzy and Barricade begin tracking Sam's location. One of the Autobots, [[Bumblebee (Transformers)#2007 Transformers film|Bumblebee]], is also on Earth, disguised as a [[Second-generation Chevrolet Camaro#1976|1976 Chevrolet Camaro]],<ref name=\"making of\" /> and is bought by Sam while shopping for his first car. Bumblebee helps him woo his crush, [[Mikaela Banes]]. Bumblebee leaves at night to transmit a homing signal to the rest of the Autobots and Sam sees him in robot mode. Barricade confronts Sam and demands Archibald's spectacles, but Bumblebee rescues him and Mikaela. After Bumblebee upgrades his vehicle form by scanning a 2006 Chevrolet Camaro, they leave to rendezvous with the rest of the Autobots: Optimus Prime, [[Jazz (Transformers)#Transformers Cinematic Universe|Jazz]], [[Ironhide (Transformers)|Ironhide]], and [[Ratchet (Transformers)#2007 Transformers film|Ratchet]]\u2014who have landed on Earth and taken the forms of Earth vehicles as well. Sam, Mikaela, and the Autobots return to Sam's home and obtain the glasses. Soon [[special agents]] from Sector 7 arrive and capture Sam, Mikaela, and Bumblebee.\n\nFrenzy, [[disguised]] as a [[mobile phone]], secretly accompanies the group to the Hoover Dam and releases Megatron. Locating the All Spark, Frenzy sends an alert to the other Decepticons. Sam convinces the Sector 7 agents to release Bumblebee so that he can get the All Spark to Optimus Prime. Frenzy's virus has shut down government communications, but a pair of hackers manage to establish a signal to the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]]. The Autobot-human convoy goes to nearby Mission City to obtain a radio that will guide the Air Force's defense and secure a rendezvous point as a safe destination for All Spark. The Decepticons attack and Bonecrusher, Frenzy, Jazz, Brawl, and Blackout are all killed during the ensuing battle, but Sam manages to ram the All Spark into Megatron's chest, killing Megatron and destroying the All Spark. Optimus takes a fragment of the All Spark from Megatron's corpse but realizes that with its destruction, their homeworld Cybertron cannot be restored. The [[US government]] decommissions Sector 7 and dumps the corpses of the defeated Decepticons into the [[Laurentian Abyss]]. As Sam and Mikaela begin a relationship and Optimus sends a signal to other surviving Autobots directing them to Earth, Starscream escapes into space.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Transformers film series cast and characters}}\n{{div col}}\n<!--Sorted to match movie credits.-->\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as [[Sam Witwicky]]: The young descendant of an Arctic explorer who stumbles upon a big secret that becomes [[the Earth]]'s final hope.\n* [[Josh Duhamel]] as Captain [[William Lennox]]: A good and dedicated hardworking [[leader]] of the [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|Army Rangers]] team in [[Qatar]] and [[allies]] himself with Sam and others. \n* [[Megan Fox]] as [[Mikaela Banes]]: A classmate of Sam who assists him in his mission by using skills she learned as a juvenile car thief from her convict father. \n* [[Tyrese Gibson]] as [[Sergeant]] [[Robert Epps]]: A [[U.S. Air Force]] [[United States Air Force Combat Control Team|Combat Controller]] and [[technical sergeant]] of a Special Operations team based at the [[Special Operations Command Central|U.S. SOCCENT]] base in Qatar and Lennox's best friend.\n* [[Rachael Taylor]] as Maggie Madsen: A former [[NSA]] data analyst recruited by the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Defense Department]].\n* [[Anthony Anderson]] as Glen Whitmann: Maggie's hacker friend.\n* [[John Turturro]] as Agent [[Seymour Simmons]]: A [[special agent]] of the [[government agency]] Sector 7 Advanced Research Division.\n* [[Jon Voight]] as John Keller: The [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]].\n* [[Michael O'Neill (actor)|Michael O'Neill]] as Tom Banachek: Head of Sector 7.\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as [[Ron Witwicky]]: Sam's father.\n* [[Julie White]] as [[Judy Witwicky]]: Sam's mother.\n* [[Amaury Nolasco]] as ACWO Jorge \"Fig\" Figueroa: A Special Operations soldier who survives the destruction of the SOCCENT base in Qatar and was also a member of Captain Lennox's team.\n* [[Zack Ward]] as [[First Sergeant]] Donnelly: A member of Captain Lennox's team.\n* [[W.
