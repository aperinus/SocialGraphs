Directed by [[Mark Robson (film director)|Mark Robson]], it follows the residents of a small fictional [[New England]] mill town in the years surrounding [[World War II]], where [[scandal]], [[homicide]], [[suicide]], [[incest]], and moral hypocrisy belie its tranquil fa\u00e7ade. It is based on [[Grace Metalious]]'s bestselling [[Peyton Place (novel)|1956 novel of the same name]].\n\nReleased in December 1957, ''Peyton Place'' was a major box-office success, though its omission of the novel's sexually explicit material was widely criticized. The film was nominated for nine [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. It won none, tying the record set by ''[[The Little Foxes (film)|The Little Foxes]]'' for most nominations with no wins.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, this section needs no more expansion and should always fall between 400-700 words.-->\nIn the [[New England]] town of Peyton Place, Paul Cross, fed up with his [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] stepfather, Lucas Cross, leaves town. Lucas is the school custodian and his downtrodden wife, Nellie, works as housekeeper for [[Constance MacKenzie|Constance \"Connie\" MacKenzie]], a widow who owns a clothing shop. The daughters of both families, [[Allison MacKenzie]] and [[Selena Cross]], are best friends and about to graduate from high school. While the MacKenzies live a comfortable life, the Cross family is [[poverty|indigent]]. At Peyton Place High School, town newcomer Michael Rossi has been hired as the new principal by school board president [[Leslie Harrington]]; the students had favored veteran teacher Elsie Thornton. Rossi wins Ms. Thornton over by offering to work with her.\n\nConnie allows Allison to have an unchaperoned birthday party. She invites her classmates, including the overtly sexual [[Betty Anderson]] and her boyfriend, [[Rodney Harrington]]. Connie is horrified to arrive home and find the teens, including Allison, [[making out]]. The next morning, Allison goes to meet Selena for church. She witnesses and then intervenes during an altercation between Lucas and Selena.\n\nAllison is named class valedictorian, and Rossi asks Connie to help chaperone the graduation dance; the two gradually develop a romantic relationship. Meanwhile, Harrington disapproves of his son, Rodney, dating Betty. Rodney then invites Allison to the dance, though she likes Norman Page, a shy, bookish boy raised by an emotionally abusive mother. Rodney tries to make out with Betty, but she remains angry that he broke up with her. Rossi asks Ms. Thornton to give a short speech and lead the song \"Auld Lang Syne\". This annoys [[Marion Partridge]], a member of the school board and a malicious gossip.\n\nShortly after, Lucas rapes and impregnates Selena. She goes to [[Matthew Swain|Dr. Matthew Swain]]. He assumes Selena's boyfriend, Ted, is the father, but she breaks down and admits Lucas raped her. Furious, Dr. Swain forces Lucas to sign a confession that he will keep secret if Lucas permanently leaves town. Unknown to either, Nellie overhears their conversation. A vengeful Lucas chases Selena when she returns home. Selena escapes but falls, starting a miscarriage. Dr. Swain records it as an appendectomy to protect Selena from scandal.\n\nAt the Labor Day parade, Rodney and Betty make up and go [[nude swimming|skinny dipping]]; nearby, Allison and Norman are also swimming, wearing bathing suits. When Marion and Charles Partridge see a naked couple, they believe it is Allison and Norman and tell Connie. During an ensuing argument with Allison, Connie angrily blurts out that Allison is illegitimate, the result of an affair she had with Allison's still living and already-married father. Upset, Allison runs upstairs, only to find that Nellie, distraught over Lucas, has committed suicide. Some time later, Rodney and Betty elope, infuriating Rodney's father, while Allison leaves home for [[New York City]].\n\nWhen [[World War II]] breaks out, many of Peyton Place's young men enlist. When Rodney is killed in action, his bereaved father finally accepts Betty as family after she explains she only acted racy to attract Rodney. During Christmas 1942, Connie visits Rossi and admits her affair. Rossi still wants to marry her.\n\nA drunken Lucas returns to town and attempts to rape Selena again. She bludgeons him to death in self-defense, then she and her younger brother, Joey, hide the body. After Easter 1943, Selena breaks down and tells Connie that she killed Lucas, who reports her to the police. Selena is arrested and tried. Allison returns for the trial, as does Norman. The truth about Selena killing Lucas in self-defense, his physical and sexual abuse, and Dr. Swain's false medical report all come to light. Dr. Swain openly berates the townspeople for their constant vicious gossip and rumors. Selena is acquitted and the town sympathetically reaches out to her; she and Ted are free to marry. Allison approaches Connie, wanting to reconcile; Norman is welcomed into the house.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Lana Turner]] as [[Constance MacKenzie]]\n* [[Diane Varsi]] as [[Allison MacKenzie]]\n* [[Hope Lange]] as [[Selena Cross]]\n* [[Lee Philips]] as [[Michael Rossi (fictional character)|Michael Rossi]]\n* [[Arthur Kennedy]] as [[Lucas Cross]]\n* [[Lloyd Nolan]] as [[Dr. Matthew Swain]]\n* [[Russ Tamblyn]] as Norman Page\n* [[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]] as [[Betty Anderson]]\n* [[David Nelson (actor)|David Nelson]] as Ted Carter\n* [[Barry Coe]] as [[Rodney Harrington]]\n* [[Betty Field]] as Nellie Cross\n* [[Mildred Dunnock]] as Miss Elsie Thornton\n* [[Leon Ames]] as [[Leslie Harrington]]\n* [[Lorne Greene]] as District Attorney\n* [[Staats Cotsworth]] as Charles Partridge\n* [[Peg Hillias]] as [[Marion Partridge]]\n* [[Robert H.

She returned to her home in [[Gilmanton, New Hampshire]],{{sfn|Kashner|MacNair|2002|pages=248\u2013251}} and publicly derided the film, though she eventually earned a total of $400,000 in exhibition
