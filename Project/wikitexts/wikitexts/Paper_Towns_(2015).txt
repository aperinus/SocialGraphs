The film was adapted for the screen by [[Scott Neustadter]] and [[Michael H. Weber]], the same team that wrote the first film adaption of another of Green's novels, ''[[The Fault in Our Stars (film)|The Fault in Our Stars]]''. The film stars [[Nat Wolff]] and [[Cara Delevingne]] and was released on July 24, 2015, in the United States by [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=citizen-times>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/story/carol-motsinger/2014/10/27/paper-towns-charlotte-filming/18011609/|title='Paper Towns' will begin filming in Charlotte next week|website=citizen-times.com|first=Carol|last=Motsinger|date=October 27, 2014|access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref> The film follows the [[coming of age]] and search by the protagonist, Quentin \"Q\" Jacobsen (Wolff), for Margo Roth Spiegelman (Delevingne), his childhood friend and object of affection. In the process, Quentin explores the relationship with his friends including his compatibility with Margo.\n\nIt grossed over $85 million worldwide after the theatrical release, against a $12 million budget.<ref name=\"BOM\" /> It was released on [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] on October 20, 2015, and grossed over $9 million in total domestic video sales.<ref name=\"The Numbers\">{{cite web|title=Paper Towns (2015)|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Paper-Towns#tab=summary|website=The Numbers|publisher=Nash Information Services, LLC.|access-date=15 May 2018}}</ref> The film received mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information.

She is a childhood friend from whom he has drifted over nine years after they discovered the corpse of a local lawyer, Robert Joyner, who killed himself after his divorce. Unbeknownst to Margo, Quentin has been infatuated with her since they became neighbors. After reaching adolescence, Margo becomes one of the popular girls, with an adventurous reputation, at Jefferson Park High School.{{Efn|name=fn2|In John Green's novel, it is [[Winter Park High School]], but in the film adaptation, it is Jefferson Park High School.<ref name=\"Central Cabarrus High School\" />}} In contrast, Quentin is kind and unassertive, but unpopular among his peers. His friends are other outcasts, Benjamin \"Ben\" Starling, and Marcus \"Radar\" Lincoln.\n\nOne night, Margo climbs through Quentin's window and recruits him for an all-night, revenge road trip. Margo discovers that her boyfriend, Jason \"Jase\" Worthington, was unfaithful (having sex) with one of her friends, Rebecca \"Becca\" Arrington. After buying supplies, they pull humiliating pranks on Jason and Rebecca, and their friends, including Margo's best friend, Lacey Pemberton. Margo accuses Lacey of not telling her about the affair. (It is revealed later that Lacey was  unaware of the affair until she was pranked). The event gives Quentin hope that he finally has a chance to develop a closer relationship with Margo. He begins to learn how to assert himself and to take chances.\n\nThe next day Margo does not come to school, and after a few days, some consider her missing, others just conclude she left for an undisclosed location. Margo's parents will not report her missing to the police since she has run away from home repeatedly before, and they believe their daughter will return eventually. After seeing a recently attached [[Woody Guthrie]] poster on her bedroom wall,  Quentin realizes that Margo deliberately left clues for him as to where she would be going. Benjamin and Marcus start searching for other clues in hopes of finding Margo so that Quentin can confess his feelings to her. Quentin bribes Margo's sister Ruthie so that they can look for the clues to Margo's whereabouts in her room.\n\nWhen Quentin, Benjamin, and Marcus attend a party at Jason's house, Lacey argues with Rebecca over her betrayal of Margo with Jason. Because of her loyalty to Margo and her revulsion towards Rebecca and Jason's [[promiscuity]], Lacey leaves in disgust. Quentin finds Lacey in a bathroom and gets to know her, discovering that, beneath her superficial exterior, she is an intelligent and compassionate person, and they become friends. After finding more clues, Quentin starts to put them together and is led with his friends to an old gift store at an abandoned strip mall. They find a map that Margo used, and discover that she has been hiding in [[Agloe, New York|Agloe]], a [[phantom settlement|paper town]] located in the State of New York. Quentin and his friends, including Marcus's girlfriend Angela, begin a two-day road trip to find Margo, hoping to be home in time for their prom after they find her. They bond on the way, as Benjamin and Lacey are going to the prom together; Marcus and Angela consummate their relationship. \n \nWhen they do not find Margo where they expect her to be, Quentin stays while the others return home with his car. He finds Margo on the street and admits his affection for her, but she does not feel the same way. She ran away from home to escape her dysfunctional family life, to figure out who she is. She left the clues to let Quentin know that she is safe, not to invite him to follow her. Margo remains in Agloe. Quentin books a bus ticket home, and they share a farewell kiss. Before he leaves, Margo tells him that she has been in contact with Ruthie since leaving Orlando. Returning to Orlando, Quentin enjoys the company of his friends at the prom. After graduation, he continues spending time with them throughout the summer before they all leave for college.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 150\n| footer    = Left to right: [[Nat Wolff]] stars as Quentin \"Q\" Jacobsen and [[Cara Delevingne]] as Margo Roth Spiegelman in the film.\n| image1    = Nat Wolff TIFF 2012.jpg\n| alt1      = Nat Wolff\n| image2    = Cara Delevingne (19406020156) (cropped).jpg\n| alt2      = Cara Delevingne\n}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Nat Wolff]] as Quentin \"Q\" Jacobsen, the film's lead protagonist\n** Josiah Cerio as young \"Q\"\n* [[Cara Delevingne]] as Margo Roth Spiegelman, Quentin's childhood friend and the object of his affection\n** [[Hannah Alligood]] as young Margo\n* [[Halston Sage]] as Lacey Pemberton, Margo's best friend, she later becomes one of Quentin's friends and Benjamin's prom date\n* [[Austin Abrams]] as Benjamin \"Ben\" Starling, one of Quentin's best friends\n** Kendall McIntyre as young Ben\n* [[Justice Smith]] as Marcus \"Radar\" Lincoln, one of Quentin's best friends\n* [[Jaz Sinclair]] as Angela, Marcus's girlfriend, and prom date, who later joins Quentin's circle of friends\n* [[Cara Buono]] as Connie Jacobsen, Quentin's mother\n* Griffin Freeman as Jason \"Jase\" Worthington, Margo's former boyfriend and Quentin's nemesis\n* [[Caitlin Carver]] as Rebecca \"Becca\" Arrington, Margo's former friend-turned-nemesis and Jason's new girlfriend\n* Meg Crosbie as Ruthie Spiegelman, Margo's sister\n* Susan Macke Miller as Debbie Spiegelman, Margo and Ruthie's mother\n* [[Tom Hillmann]] as Josh Spiegelman, Margo and Ruthie's father\n* RJ Shearer as Chuck Parson, Jason's best friend, Lacey's former boyfriend, and Quentin's nemesis  \n* [[Jim Coleman (actor)|Jim Coleman]] as Detective Otis Warren with the [[Orlando Police Department]]\n* Lane Lovegrove as Robert Joyner, the local man whose corpse was found by Margo and Quentin after he committed suicide\n* [[Ansel Elgort]] (cameo) as Mason, the convenience store clerk who is infatuated with Lacey\n* Stevie Ray Dallimore as Hank Jacobsen, Quentin's father  \n* [[John Green]] (voice) as Dwight Arrington, Rebecca's father\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Pre-production===\nThe rights to the film had been optioned since at least 2008;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nerdfighters.ning.com/profiles/blog/show?id=1833893%3ABlogPost%3A1046902 |title=Paper Towns Movie!!11!! |first=John |last=Green |date=October 24, 2008 |access-date=November 9, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221055807/http://nerdfighters.ning.com/profiles/blog/show?id=1833893%3ABlogPost%3A1046902 |archive-date=December 21, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Green wrote the first draft of the screenplay himself.<ref name=\"youtube\">{{YouTube |id=v9y0k15ok3k&t=2m48s |title=Lighting Candles for Rwanda (at 2:48)}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the novel features a scene set in [[SeaWorld]] the location was changed after the release of the [[CNN]] documentary ''[[Blackfish (film)|Blackfish]]'' which was highly critical of the theme park keeping orcas.<ref name=\"papertown\">{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/seaworld-scene-cut-john-greens-763312|title=SeaWorld Scene Cut From John Green's 'Paper Towns' Film|first= Rebecca|last=Ford|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 16, 2015|access-date=January 18, 2015| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150123000412/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/seaworld-scene-cut-john-greens-763312 | archive-date=January 23, 2015| url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|id=eCW3YrYXr-0|title=Is the Paper Towns Movie Like the Book?
