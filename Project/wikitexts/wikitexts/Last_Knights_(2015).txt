When minister Geza Mott beats Bartok for failing to provide an adequate bribe, Bartok retaliates and is put to trial where he denounces the loss of honour in the empire. Raiden is ordered to execute his master Bartok, whose clan is disbanded and estate divided. Geza has his warrior Ito watch Raiden lest he seek revenge.\n\nA year passes and Geza, still fearful of Raiden, demands half his father-in-law Auguste's troops to protect construction of his newly fortified estate, and is promoted to First Councillor to the Emperor. The Emperor chides Geza for his paranoid behavior over Raiden who is now a drunkard. Raiden has sold his sword for drink, his wife has left him, and he is hated by his men for killing Bartok. Geza relaxes his watch on Raiden.\n\nRaiden and the Bartok clan soldiers have sacrificed everything for the illusion of complete defeat, while preparing to avenge Bartok's death. Auguste, an old friend of Bartok, has made a pact to help Raiden in return for freeing his daughter from her abusive marriage to Geza. Raiden and his men infiltrate Geza's estate and face Geza's soldiers.\n\nRaiden kills Ito in a duel; Ito's men surrender to him. Raiden breaks into Geza's bedroom and decapitates him as his men rescue Bartok's daughter. <!-- Bartok's daughter? Or Auguste's? Name? --> The Emperor's council realises the public view Geza's death as righteous and widely support the Bartok clan. They caution him against the risk of turning the people against the crown. Raiden asks that only he be executed for Geza's death.\n\nThe crown publicly acknowledges the righteousness of the Bartok clan, but reminds the crowd that killing a high council member is the same as an attack on the emperor and Raiden will be executed. Raiden charges Lieutenant Cortez to take control of the Bartok clan. In flashback, he apologises to Naomi. Raiden lowers his head with his eyes closed, and as the executioner draws his sword back, Raiden's eyes suddenly open wide as the screen goes to black.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Clive Owen]] as Raiden\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Bartok\n* [[Cliff Curtis]] as Lieutenant Cortez\n* [[Aksel Hennie]] as Geza Mott\n* [[Dave Legeno]] as Olaf\n* [[Ayelet Zurer]] as Naomi\n* [[Shohreh Aghdashloo]] as Maria\n* [[Ahn Sung-ki]] as Auguste\n* [[Tsuyoshi Ihara]] as Ito\n* [[Park Si-yeon]] as Hannah\n* Hannah Rose Caton as Lilly\n* [[:it:Giorgio Caputo|Giorgio Caputo]] as Slim Tully\n* James Babson as Fat Jim\n* [[Payman Maadi]] as Emperor\n* Noah Silver as Gabriel\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=October 2015}}\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 16% based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 3.3/10.
