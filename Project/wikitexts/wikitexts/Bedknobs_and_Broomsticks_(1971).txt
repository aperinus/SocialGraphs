It is loosely based upon the books ''[[The Magic Bedknob|The Magic Bedknob; or, How to Become a Witch in Ten Easy Lessons]]'' (1944) and ''[[Bonfires and Broomsticks]]'' (1947) by English children's author [[Mary Norton (writer)|Mary Norton]]. Combining live action and animation, the film stars [[Angela Lansbury]], [[David Tomlinson]], [[John Ericson]], and introducing Ian Weighill, [[Cindy O'Callaghan]], and Roy Snart.\n\nDuring the early 1960s, ''Bedknobs and Broomsticks'' entered development when the negotiations for the film rights to ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964) were placed on hold. When the rights were acquired, the film was shelved repeatedly due to the similarities with ''Mary Poppins'' until it was revived in 1969. Originally at a length of 139 minutes, ''Bedknobs and Broomsticks'' was edited down to just under two hours prior to its premiere at the [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City. As with ''Mary Poppins'', the [[Sherman Brothers]] composed the film's songs.\n\nThe film was released on October 7, 1971, to mixed reviews from film critics, some of whom praised the live-action/animated sequence. The film received five [[Academy Awards]] nominations winning one for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Special Visual Effects]]. This was the last film released prior to the death of [[Walt Disney]]'s surviving brother, [[Roy O. Disney]], who died two months later. It is also the last theatrical film [[Reginald Owen]] appeared in before his death the next year in 1972; his last two acting credits were for television.\n\nIn 1996, the film was restored with most of the deleted material re-inserted back into the film. A [[Bedknobs and Broomsticks (musical)|stage musical adaptation]] has been produced. The musical had its world premiere at the [[Theatre Royal, Newcastle|Theatre Royal]], in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], on 14 August 2021 before embarking on a UK and Ireland tour, until May 2022.<ref>{{cite web|date=2021-05-10|title=Bedknobs & Broomsticks Musical UK Tour - Bedknobs & Broomsticks Tickets 2021|url=https://britishtheatre.com/bedknobs-and-broomsticks-musical-uk-tour/|access-date=2021-06-04|website=British Theatre|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn August 1940, during the [[Battle of Britain]], three children named Charlie, Carrie, and Paul Rawlins are [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]] from [[London]] to Pepperinge Eye, near the [[Dorset]] coast, where they are placed in the reluctant care of Miss Eglantine Price. The children discover Miss Price is learning [[witchcraft]] through a [[Distance education|correspondence school]] with hopes of using her spells in the British war effort against the [[Nazis]], and offers the children a transportation spell in exchange for their silence. She casts the spell on a bedknob.\n\nMiss Price receives a letter from her school announcing its closure, thus preventing her from learning the final spell. She convinces Paul to use the enchanted bed to return the group to London, and locate the headmaster, Professor Emelius Browne. Browne turns out to be a common [[Street performance|street magician]] who created the course from an old book, and is shocked to learn the spells actually work. He reveals his real reason for closing the school: the book is damaged and the final spell, \"Substitutiary Locomotion\", is missing. The group travels to [[Portobello Road Market|Portobello Road]] to locate the rest of the book. After an exchange with an old bookseller, Miss Price learns that the spell is engraved on a magical medallion called the Star of Astaroth. The bookseller explains that Astaroth used the medallion to [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphise]] a pack of wild animals, who then killed him and took the Star to a remote island called Naboombu.\n\nThe group travels to Naboombu. The bed goes underwater, where Mr. Browne and Miss Price enter a dance contest and win first prize. The bed is fished out of the sea by a bear, who brings the group before the island's ruler, King Leonidas the [[lion]], who is wearing the Star of Astaroth. Leonidas invites Mr. Browne to act as a referee in a [[Association football| soccer game]]. The chaotic match ends in Leonidas' self-proclaimed victory, while Mr. Browne swaps the medallion with his referee whistle as he leaves. A furious Leonidas runs towards the group to get the medallion back, but Miss Price turns him into a rabbit in the nick of time.\n\nBack home, Miss Price casts the spell using the [[magic word|magic words]] from the medallion (Treguna Mekoides Trecorum Satis Dee), which imbues inanimate objects with life. When Miss Price is informed that the children can be moved to another home, she decides to let them stay, realizing she has come to love them and vice versa. The children declare they want Mr. Browne to be their father, but Mr. Browne, wary of commitment, bids goodbye to the group and attempts to take a train back to London. A platoon of [[Nazi German]] commandos land on the coast via [[U-boat]] as part of an exercise and invade Miss Price's house, imprisoning her and the children in the local museum. At the train station, Mr. Browne fends off two Germans cutting phone lines and heads back to Miss Price's house, using a spell that he taught Miss Price to disguise himself and avoid the Germans. He inspires Miss Price to use the spell to enchant the museum's exhibits into an army. The army of knights' armor and military uniforms chases the Germans away, but as they retreat, they destroy Miss Price's workshop, ending her career as a witch. Though disappointed her career is over, she is happy she played a small part in the war effort.\n\nShortly afterwards, Mr. Browne enlists in the army and departs with the local [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] escorting him, promising the children he will return soon. Paul reveals he still has the enchanted bedknob, hinting they can continue with their adventures.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Angela Lansbury]] as Miss Eglantine Price. Miss Price is initially a somewhat reclusive woman, reluctant to take in children from London as she believes they will get in the way of her witchcraft, which she prefers to keep secret but hopes to use to bring World War II to an end. However, she bonds with the children and falls in love with Mr. Browne during their journey.\n* [[David Tomlinson]] as Mr. Emelius Browne. Introduced as \"Professor Browne,\" the title by which Miss Price knows him, he is running a Correspondence College of Witchcraft based on what he believes to be \"nonsense words\" found in an old book. When Miss Price and the children find him in London, he is revealed to be a street performer and con artist, and not a very good one.  He is, however, a smooth talker, which proves useful on the group's adventures, and believes in doing everything \"with a flair.\"  As the adventures unfold, he finds himself developing an attachment to Miss Price and the children, a feeling he struggles with.\n* Ian Weighill as Charles \"Charlie\" Rawlins. Charlie is the eldest of the orphaned Rawlins children; eleven, going on twelve, according to Carrie, an age which Miss Price calls \"The Age of Not Believing.\"  Accordingly, he is initially cynical and disbelieving of Miss Price's magical efforts, but comes around as time goes on; it is at his initial suggestion that Ms. Price uses the Substitutiary Locomotion spell on the museum artifacts.\n* [[Cindy O'Callaghan]] as Carrie Rawlins.  Slightly younger than Charlie, she takes on a motherly attitude toward her brothers, especially Paul. She is the first to encourage a friendly relationship between Miss Price and the children. \n* Roy Snart as Paul Rawlins.  Paul is about six; his possession of the bedknob and the Isle of Naboombu children's book lead to the group's adventures as well as the eventual solution to the quest for the Substitutiary Locomotion spell.  Paul is prone to blurting out whatever is on his mind, which occasionally leads to trouble.\n* [[Roddy McDowall]] as Mr. Rowan Jelk, the local clergyman.  Deleted scenes reveal Mr. Jelk to be interested in marrying Miss Price, largely for her property.\n* [[Sam Jaffe]] as the Bookman, a mysterious criminal also in pursuit of the Substitutiary Locomotion spell.  It is implied that there is some history and bad blood between him and Mr. Browne.\n* [[Bruce Forsyth]] as Swinburne, a [[spiv]] and associate of the Bookman's who acts as his muscle.\n* [[Tessie O'Shea]] as Mrs. Jessica \"Jessie\" Hobday, the local postmistress of Pepperinge Eye and chairwoman of the War Activities Committee.\n* [[John Ericson]] as Colonel Heller, leader of the German raiding party which comes ashore at Pepperinge Eye.\n* [[Reginald Owen]] as Major General Sir Brian Teagler, commander of the local Home Guard.\n* [[Arthur Gould-Porter]] as Captain Ainsley Greer, a British Army captain who comes from HQ in London to inspect the Home Guard and becomes lost in the area. He is constantly running into locals who suspect him of being a Nazi in disguise.\n* [[Hank Worden]] as Old Home Guard Soldier (uncredited)\n* [[Cyril Delevanti]] as Elderly farmer\n* [[Alan Hewitt]] as a Soldier\n\n===Voices===\n* [[Lennie Weinrib]] as King Leonidas, a [[lion]] who is the ruler of the Isle of Naboombu. He is a devoted soccer player with a fearsome temper, as well as a notorious cheat who is known to make up the rules as he goes along \u2013 according to Paul's book.\n** Lennie Weinrib also voices the [[Secretary bird]], a prim and proper type who often bears the brunt of King Leonidas' temper.\n* [[Dallas McKennon]] as Fisherman Bear, a [[brown bear]] who is a sailor and fisherman on the Isle of Naboombu. He is the one who pulls the bed, with Miss Price's group on it, out of the lagoon with his fishing pole, and takes them to see the King after warning them of his temper.\n* [[Bob Holt (actor)|Bob Holt]] as Codfish, a denizen of the Naboombu lagoon who judges the underwater dance contest.\n\n==Production==\nEnglish author Mary Norton published her first children's book, ''The Magic Bedknob'', in 1943. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported in August 1945 that Walt Disney had purchased the film rights to the book. Norton then published ''Bonfires and Broomsticks'' in 1947, and the two children's books were then combined into ''Bed-Knob and Broomsticks'' in 1957. During the negotiations for the film rights to ''Mary Poppins'' with [[P.L. Travers]] in 1961, a film adaptation of ''Bedknobs and Broomsticks'' was suggested as an alternative project. When the negotiations stalled, Disney instructed the Sherman brothers to begin working on the project.{{sfn|Koenig|1997|pp=145\u20136}} During a story conference with producer [[Bill Walsh (producer)|Bill Walsh]] and writer [[Don DaGradi]], as the Sherman brothers were singing the song \"Eglantine\", Walt fell asleep in his chair.<ref>{{cite interview| subject=Richard Sherman| url=http://animatedviews.com/2009/richard-m-sherman-on-bedknobs-and-broomsticks-a-solid-songwriter/| title=Richard M.

As the Sherman brothers' contract with the Disney studios was set to expire in 1968, they were contacted by Bill Walsh in their office to start work on the film. Then, Walsh, DaGradi, and the Sherman brothers re-assembled to work on the storyline for several months. Although there was no plan to put the film into production at the time, Walsh promised the Shermans that he would call them back to the studio and finish the project, which he eventually did in November 1969.{{sfn|Sherman|Sherman|1998|p=162}} Throughout 1970 and 1971, the Sherman brothers reworked their musical compositions for the film. The song, \"[[The Beautiful Briny]]\" was originally written for ''Mary Poppins'' for when Mary spins a compass sending the Banks children into several exotic locations, but it was later used for ''Bedknobs and Broomsticks''.{{sfn|Koenig|1997|p=146}}{{sfn|Sherman|Sherman|1998|p=166}}\n\n===Casting===\n[[Leslie Caron]], [[Lynn Redgrave]], [[Judy Carne]], and [[Julie Andrews]] were all considered for the role of Eglantine Price.<ref name=\"Maltin\">{{cite book| last=Maltin| first=Leonard| author-link=Leonard Maltin| title=The Disney Films| publisher=Disney Editions| page=262| isbn=978-0786885275| year=2000}}</ref> Andrews was initially offered the part, but hesitated.

Weighill had previously dropped out of school and began his acting career in an uncredited role as a schoolboy in ''[[David Copperfield (1969 film)|David Copperfield]]'' (1969). He auditioned before Disney talent scouts for one of the child roles in ''Bedknobs and Broomsticks'' in London, and was cast as Charlie. Prior to ''Bedknobs'', Snart was a child actor appearing in numerous commercials, and was cast as Paul for his \"impish, cheeky look\". For the part of Carrie, O'Callaghan had previously acted in television commercials and later made her stage debut in a production of ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]'' at the [[Scala Theatre]]. There, she caught the attention of Disney's talent scouts.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/63648756/3-english-children-get-big-break-from/ | title=3 English Children Get Big Break from Disney | work=[[Press & Sun-Bulletin]] | page=8 | via=Newspapers.com | date=March 25, 1972 | access-date=October 11, 2018 | archive-date=June 20, 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210620221109/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/63648756/3-english-children-get-big-break-from/ | url-status=live }} {{Open access}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography|Filming]] took place at the Disney studios in Burbank, California from early March to June 10, 1970.<ref>{{cite web| last=LoBianco| first=Lorraine| url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/188901%7C0/Bedknobs-and-Broomsticks.html| title=Bedknobs and Broomsticks| website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]| access-date=July 17, 2018| archive-date=July 18, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718055141/http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/188901%7C0/Bedknobs-and-Broomsticks.html| url-status=live}}</ref> The coastal scenes featuring German soldiers were shot on location at a nearby California beach.

The edit included several newly discovered songs, including \"Nobody's Problems\", performed by Lansbury. The number had been cut before the premiere of the film. Lansbury had only made a demo recording, singing with a solo piano because the orchestrations would have been added when the picture was scored. When the song was cut, the orchestrations had not yet been added; therefore, it was finally orchestrated and put together when it was placed back into the film.\n\nThe soundtrack for some of the spoken tracks was unrecoverable.
