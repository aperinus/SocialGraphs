Josef explains that he has an inoperable [[brain tumor]] and is expected to die before his pregnant wife Angela gives birth, so he wishes to have Aaron record a video diary for his unborn child. Throughout the day, Josef demonstrates eccentric behavior that makes Aaron uneasy, which culminates in Josef confessing that he raped his wife. As an increasingly-disturbed Aaron is hindered from departing by being unable to locate his car keys, he intercepts a phone call from Angela, who reveals she is actually Josef's sister and urges Aaron to escape. Josef, however, attempts to stop Aaron from leaving, leading to a scuffle that ends with Aaron getting away.\n\nBack at his home, Aaron starts receiving items in the mail from Josef, including a recording of Josef digging a grave. The police are unable to take action due to Aaron's knowing little about Josef, who Aaron realizes is stalking him. A final DVD is sent to Aaron, in which Josef offers to meet him in a public park to make amends. Aaron accepts Josef's offer, but places a camera on himself and sets his phone to  dial the police as a precaution. While Aaron waits on a park bench for Josef to arrive, Josef kills him from behind with an axe. Reviewing the footage, Josef questions why Aaron did not turn around in the moments leading up to his death. He concludes that Aaron believed he was a good person who would not harm him and because of this, he declares Aaron to be his favorite victim.\n\nJosef, now calling himself Bill, later receives a phone call from his newest target as he places a DVD of Aaron's murder alongside recordings of his past victims.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mark Duplass]] as Josef/Bill\n* [[Patrick Brice]] as Aaron\n\nDuplass' real-life spouse [[Katie Aselton]] makes an uncredited appearance as the voice of Angela.\n\n==Production==\nDuplass said that the film's story \"was inspired by character-driven dramas that are, at their heart, [[two-hander]]s: ''[[My Dinner with Andre]]'', ''[[Misery (film)|Misery]]'', and ''[[Fatal Attraction]]''\" as well as \"[his] myriad of strange [[Craigslist]] experiences over the years.\"<ref name=ac>{{cite news|last=Whittaker|first=Richard|title=Mark Duplass Is a Creep|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/screens/2015-07-14/mark-duplass-is-a-creep/|newspaper=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|date=July 14, 2015|access-date=October 23, 2016|archive-date=October 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024153205/http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/screens/2015-07-14/mark-duplass-is-a-creep/|url-status=live}}</ref> Brice and Duplass originally began working on ''Creep'' under the working title ''Peachfuzz'' after the wolf mask owned by Duplass' character, but chose to rename the film as the title's relevance came later in the movie's plot and they did not want viewers to \"spend the first half hour trying to figure out why the movie is called ''Peachfuzz'' and [not] pay attention to the very intricate details\".<ref name=STYD>{{cite web|last=Turek|first=Ryan|title=SXSW Interview: Mark Duplass, Patrick Brice on Bringing Creep to Life|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/349719-sxsw-interview-mark-duplass-patrick-brice-on-bringing-creep-to-life/|publisher=STYD|access-date=March 18, 2014|archive-date=March 31, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331000839/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/349719-sxsw-interview-mark-duplass-patrick-brice-on-bringing-creep-to-life/|url-status=live}}</ref> The two built the movie from a series of conversations they had with one another and decided to refine ''Creep'' while they were filming, which enabled them to film and screen portions of the film to see what would or would not work on camera.<ref name=STYD /> As a result, the film had multiple alternate end scenarios and Duplass stated that there were \"10 to 12 permutations of each scene\".<ref name=STYD />\n\nOf the creative process for his character, Josef, Duplass explained: \"We were interested in the psychological profile of this very, very strange person. We were very interested in how you meet people and don\u2019t quite understand what\u2019s up, but you start to get signs.
