Written by [[Jules Furthman]] and [[Leigh Brackett]], based on the short story \"Rio Bravo\" by B. H. McCampbell, the film stars Wayne as a Texan sheriff who arrests the brother of a powerful local rancher for murder and then has to hold the man in jail until a [[U.S. Marshal]] can arrive. With the help of a \"cripple\", a drunk and a young gunfighter, they hold off the rancher's gang. ''Rio Bravo'' was filmed on location at [[Old Tucson Studios]] outside [[Tucson]], Arizona, in [[Technicolor]].\n\nIn 2014, ''Rio Bravo'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-14-210/ |title=Cinematic Treasures Named to National Film Registry |date=17 December 2014 |access-date=4 August 2018 |work=[[National Film Preservation Board]] |issn=0731-3527 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |archive-date=11 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911175030/https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-14-210/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-08|archive-date=2016-10-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031213743/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries for feature films must be between 400-700 words. Please check wordcount before adding anything. Current wordcount is 695 words-->\nJoe Burdette, the spoiled younger brother of wealthy land baron Nathan Burdette, taunts town drunk Dude by tossing money into a [[spittoon]]. The sheriff, John T. Chance, stops Dude from reaching into the spittoon, prompting Dude to lash out and knock Chance unconscious. Joe starts to beat Dude for fun, shooting and killing an unarmed bystander who attempts to stop him. Chance recovers, follows Joe into Nathan's personal saloon, and, with help from a penitent Dude, overcomes Nathan's men and arrests Joe for murder.\n\nChance's friend Pat Wheeler attempts to enter town with a wagon train of supplies and dynamite, but has to force his way through Nathan Burdette's men. Chance reveals that he, Dude (who used to be a deputy before he became a drunk), and his old crippled deputy Stumpy are all that stand between Nathan's small army and Joe, whom they wish to free. Chance notices young gunslinger Colorado Ryan in Wheeler's wagon train, but Colorado promises he doesn't want to start any trouble.\n\nThat night, Carlos Robante, the owner of the local hotel, warns Chance that Wheeler is trying to recruit fighters. Chance tries to stop Wheeler, not wanting anyone to get hurt on his account. Wheeler asks if Colorado could help, but Colorado declines, feeling that it's not his fight. Chance then notices a rigged card game at the hotel. Recognizing one of the players as a wanted woman, \"Feathers\", the widow of a cheating gambler, he confronts her. However, Colorado reveals that another player is the cheater.\n\nOut in the street, Wheeler is gunned down. Chance and Dude pursue the killer into Nathan's saloon, and Chance allows Dude to prove himself and confront the killer, earning the respect of Nathan's men. Colorado and the rest of Wheeler's men are forced to stay in town to await a court order releasing Wheeler's possessions, and the wagons are left behind the Burdette warehouse. After Feathers secretly stays up all night with a shotgun to guard Chance, an irritated Chance orders Feathers to leave town for her safety. She refuses, and the two begin to bond.\n\nNathan himself rides into town. Stumpy, having old grudges against Nathan for taking his land, threatens to shoot Joe if any trouble starts around the jail. In response, Nathan has his saloon musicians repeatedly play \"[[El Deg\u00fcello]]\", {{aka}} \"The Cutthroat Song\". Colorado realizes the song means Nathan will show no mercy, and warns Chance.\n\nChance gives Dude back his old guns and some clothes and a black hat he left behind when he became a drunkard, and Dude gets a shave, trying to start afresh. Unfortunately, Stumpy doesn't recognize Dude when he returns, and shoots at him, shattering Dude's nerves. The next day, Dude is still shaky and finds himself ambushed by Burdette's men, who threaten to kill him unless Chance lets Joe go. Colorado and Feathers distract the men long enough for Chance to get his rifle, and he and Colorado shoot down the men and free Dude. Dude thinks about quitting and letting Colorado take his place, but when he hears \"El Deg\u00fcello\" being played, he resolves to see the thing through to the end.\n\nDude and Chance return to the hotel so Dude can take a bath, but Burdette's men capture Carlos' wife Consuelo and use her to lure Chance into a trap. Dude tells Chance to take the men to the jail, under pretext that Stumpy would let Joe out. However, Stumpy opens fire, as Dude secretly predicted. In the chaos, some men drag Dude off to Nathan, who demands a trade{{--}}Dude for Joe. Chance agrees, but brings Colorado as backup. Dude and Joe brawl during the trade, and a firefight ensues. Stumpy throws some sticks of dynamite from the wagons into the warehouse where Burdette and his men are holed up, and Chance detonates them with his rifle, abruptly ending the fight.\n\nWith both Burdettes and their few surviving gunmen in jail, Chance is able to finally spend some time with Feathers and admit his feelings for her. Colorado volunteers to guard the jail, allowing Stumpy and Dude to enjoy a night out in the town.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Howard Hawks'Rio Bravo trailer (27).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|John Wayne and Angie Dickinson in ''Rio Bravo'']]\n* [[John Wayne]] as John T.

The film received favorable reviews, and was successful, taking in over [[US$]]5.5 million.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\nA brief clip from ''Rio Bravo'' was among the archive footage later incorporated into the opening sequence of Wayne's last film, ''[[The Shootist]],'' to illustrate the backstory of Wayne's character.\n\nAs was often the case in a John Wayne Western, Wayne wore his \"Red River D\" belt buckle in the movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redriverdbeltbuckle.com/|website=Red River D Belt Buckle|title=History of the Red River D Buckle|access-date=2021-04-23|archive-date=2021-01-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210123103333/http://redriverdbeltbuckle.com/|url-status=live}}</ref> It can be clearly seen in the scene when Nathan Burdette comes to visit his brother Joe in the jail where he is being held for the U.S. Marshal, about 60 minutes into the film.\n\nThe story was credited to \"B.H.

His score includes the hauntingly ominous \"''[[El Deg\u00fcello]]''\" theme, which is heard several times.<ref>[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/xed01 The Handbook of Texas Online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310183148/https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/xed01 |date=2016-03-10 }}, Texas State Historical Association (retrieved on November 22, 2006).</ref> The Colorado character identifies the tune as \"The Cutthroat Song\". He relates that the song was played on the orders of General [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] to the Texans holed up in [[Battle of the Alamo|the Alamo]], to signify that no quarter would be given to them. The tune was used in Wayne's film ''[[The Alamo (1960 film)|The Alamo]]'' (1960). Composer [[Ennio Morricone]] recalled that director [[Sergio Leone]] asked him to write \"Dimitri Tiomkin music\" for ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]''. The trumpet theme is similar to Tiomkin's \"''Deg\u00fcello''\" (the Italian title of ''Rio Bravo'' was ''Un dollaro d'onore'', ''A Dollar of Honor'').{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}\n\nBecause the film starred a [[crooner]], Martin, and a [[teen idol]], Nelson, Hawks included three songs in the [[soundtrack]]. Before the big [[shootout|showdown]], in the [[jail|jail house]], Martin sings \"My Rifle, My Pony, and Me\" (which contains new lyrics by Webster to a Tiomkin tune that appeared in ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]''), accompanied by Nelson, after which Nelson sings a brief version of \"[[Cindy (folk song)|Get Along Home, Cindy]]\", accompanied by Martin and Brennan. Over the closing credits, Martin, backed by the [[Nelson Riddle]] Orchestra, sings a specially composed song, \"Rio Bravo\", written by Tiomkin with lyrics by [[Paul Francis Webster]]. Nelson later paid homage to both the film and his character, Colorado, by including the song \"Restless Kid\" on his 1959 [[LP (format)|LP]], ''Ricky Sings Again''.\n\nMembers of the [[Western Writers of America]] chose \"My Rifle, My Pony, and Me\" as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.<ref name=\"Top100\">{{Cite web |title=The Top 100 Western Songs |author=Western Writers of America |year=2010 |author-link=Western Writers of America |publisher=American Cowboy |url=http://www.americancowboy.com/culture/top-100-western-songs |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019002745/http://americancowboy.com/culture/top-100-western-songs |archive-date=19 October 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==''High Noon'' debate==\n[[File:John Wayne and Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson in 'Rio Bravo', 1959.jpg|thumb|right|{{center|Theatrical poster, 1959}}]]\nThe film was made as a response to ''[[High Noon]]'',<ref name=\"michael munn\">{{cite book|last1=Munn|first1=Michael|title=John Wayne: The Man Behind the Myth|date=2005|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=0451214145|page=190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qqatDJRg1NYC&q=john+wayne+high+noon+rio+bravo&pg=PA190|access-date=1 February 2015|archive-date=23 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210423231622/https://books.google.com/books?id=qqatDJRg1NYC&q=john+wayne+high+noon+rio+bravo&pg=PA190|url-status=live}}</ref> which is sometimes thought to be an [[allegory]] for [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisting in Hollywood]], as well as a critique of [[McCarthyism]].<ref>[http://tags.library.upenn.edu/rollmang/blacklist Blacklist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207032051/http://tags.library.upenn.edu/rollmang/blacklist |date=2009-02-07}}</ref> Wayne would later call ''High Noon'' \"un-American\" and say he did not regret helping run the writer, [[Carl Foreman]], out of the country.<ref name=manfred/> Director Howard Hawks went on the record to criticize ''High Noon'' by saying, \"I didn't think a good sheriff was going to go running around town like a chicken with his head cut off asking for help, and finally his Quaker wife had to save him.\"<ref name=\"jeff stafford\" /> According to film historian [[Emanuel Levy]], Wayne and Hawks teamed up deliberately to rebut ''High Noon'' by telling a somewhat similar story their own way: portraying a hero who does not show fear or inner conflict and who never repudiates his commitment to public duty, while only allying himself with capable people, despite offers of help from many other characters.
