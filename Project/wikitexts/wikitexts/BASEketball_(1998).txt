They find themselves outside drinking beer and shooting a basketball when two classmates challenge them to a game. After seeing that their opponents are very good at basketball, they say they will only play a game they picked up in the streets (while secretly inventing the rules as they play, based on both basketball and baseball). After winning, they decide to refine the rules to the game and Coop makes the first BASEketball out of a [[La-Z-Boy]] chair. Their friend, Kenny \"Squeak\" Scolari, tags along and the sport becomes very popular in the neighborhood over the next six months.\n\nBusinessman Ted Denslow meets Coop and Remer and proposes the creation of the National BASEketball League (NBL) along with numerous rules in place to prevent its decline: teams cannot switch cities, players cannot be traded, individuals cannot make money via corporate sponsorship deals, and it is completely open to anyone who wants to play, with Denslow stating that \"anyone can be a sports hero\". Coop is reluctant, but ultimately accepts the opportunity.\n\nFive years later, the NBL is in full swing with teams, fans, stadiums, and a major championship, the Denslow Cup. Denslow is owner of the Milwaukee Beers, Coop and Remer's team. During the championship game, Denslow dies from choking on a hot dog, causing Coop to miss his shot and costing the Beers the game. Denslow's [[Will and testament|will]] names Coop as owner of the Beers for one year on the condition that they win the next Denslow Cup; otherwise, ownership reverts to Denslow's widow Yvette. Coop and Remer then meet Jenna Reed, head of the Dream Come True Foundation, and Joey, one of the children in her care and a passionate fan of BASEketball; Coop, Remer and Squeak begin spending time with the two, with Coop eventually forming a relationship with Jenna.\n\nBaxter Cain, owner of the Dallas Felons, wants to remove Denslow's rules preventing [[monetization]] of the sport, but could not while Denslow was alive. However, Coop refuses to accept any changes; Cain partners with Yvette as he tries to make the Beers lose the next Denslow Cup so she will own the team; however, the Beers still continue winning games and heading towards the championship. Cain approaches Remer, telling him that he made an offer to Coop, but Coop refused without telling Remer. Remer confronts Coop about what Cain told him, and Coop quickly compromises by declaring Remer part owner of the team.\n\nLater, Cain cuts the funding to Jenna's foundation in an attempt to get Coop and Remer to adopt a clothing line; Coop is against it, but Remer agrees and becomes conceited with his newfound [[A-list]] status. After the semifinals, Cain informs Coop and Remer that the clothing line has been produced through [[child labor]] in [[Calcutta]]; if the public finds out, the team and Jenna's foundation will be ruined. Cain blackmails Coop and Remer into losing or forfeiting the Denslow Cup game or he will inform the public. Jenna learns about the scandal and breaks up with Coop, as Coop and Remer blame each other for the controversy.\n\nWith their friendship dissolved, Coop goes to Calcutta, aiming to resolve the situation by replacing the child workers with adults. Making it back to the championship game just as it begins, Coop and Remer still argue with each other and the Beers are losing; by the seventh-inning stretch, the Beers are down 16\u20130. Having had enough of Coop and Remer's feuding, Squeak gives the stadium an impassioned speech, reminding Coop and Remer where they came from, how much they changed everyone else's lives, and what they risk losing. Motivated, Coop and Remer reconcile their differences as Yvette, also moved by Squeak's speech, breaks off her alliance with Cain. After shifting their focus back in the game, they are poised to win when Coop's La-Z-Boy pops. Coop is crestfallen until Joey brings him a new BASEketball made from a [[Barcalounger]]. After a risky last throw, they win the Denslow Cup. Jenna and Coop reconcile as Yvette makes out with Remer and the both of them skate around the stadium with their new trophy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Trey Parker]] as Joe \"Coop/Airman\" Cooper\n* [[Matt Stone]] as Doug \"Sir Swish\" Remer\n* [[Dian Bachar]] as Kenny \"Squeak/Little Bitch\" Scolari\n* [[Yasmine Bleeth]] as Jenna Reed\n* [[Jenny McCarthy]] as Yvette Denslow\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Ted Denslow\n* [[Robert Vaughn]] as Baxter Cain\n* [[Trevor Einhorn]] as Joey Thomas\n* [[Francis X.
