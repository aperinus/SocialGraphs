The film follows Sam Bell ([[Sam Rockwell]]), a man who experiences a personal crisis as he nears the end of a three-year solitary stint mining [[helium-3]] on the [[far side of the Moon]]. [[Kevin Spacey]] voices Sam's robot companion, GERTY. ''Moon'' premiered at the 2009 [[Sundance Film Festival]] and was released in selected cinemas in [[New York City|New York]] and [[Los Angeles]] on 12 June 2009. The release was expanded to additional theatres in the [[United States]] on 10 July and to the [[United Kingdom]] on 17 July. A follow-up film containing an [[epilogue]] to the film's events, [[Mute (2018 film)|''Mute'']], was released in 2018. A third installment, a graphic novel called ''Madi: Once Upon A Time in the Future'', was released in 2020.\n\n''Moon'' was modestly budgeted and grossed just under $10 million worldwide<ref name=\"Mojo\" /> but was well-received by critics. Rockwell's performance found praise. The movie won numerous film critic and film festival awards and was nominated for the [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film]], and won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]] in 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the near future,{{efn|A computer screen shows a date of 2035 in one scene towards the end.}} Lunar Industries has made a fortune after an oil crisis by building Sarang Station, a facility on the far side of [[the Moon]] to mine the alternative fuel [[helium-3]] from lunar soil, which is rich in the material. The facility is [[Post-scarcity economy|highly automated]], requiring only a single human to maintain operations, oversee the harvesters, and launch canisters bound for [[Earth]] containing the extracted helium-3. Samuel Bell nears the end of his three-year work contract at Sarang Station. Chronic communication problems have disabled his live feed from Earth and limit him to occasional recorded messages from his wife Tess, who was pregnant with their daughter Eve when he left. His only companion is an [[artificial intelligence]] named GERTY, who assists with the base's automation and provides comfort for him.\n\nTwo weeks before his return to Earth, Sam begins to suffer from hallucinations of a teenage girl and a bearded, disheveled man. One such image distracts him while he is out recovering a helium-3 canister from a harvester, causing him to crash his [[lunar rover]] into the harvester. Rapidly losing cabin air from the crash, Sam falls unconscious.\n\nSam awakes in the base infirmary with no memory of the accident. He overhears GERTY having what appears to be a live chat with Lunar Industries management. Lunar Industries then orders Sam to remain on base and informs him that a rescue team will arrive to repair the harvester. Suspicious, Sam manufactures a fake problem to persuade GERTY to let him outside. He travels to the crashed rover, where he finds his unconscious [[doppelganger]]. He brings the double back to the base and tends to his injuries. The two Sams start to wonder if one is a [[Human cloning|clone]] of the other. After a heated argument and physical altercation, GERTY reveals that they are both clones of the original Sam Bell. GERTY activated the newest clone after the rover crash and convinced him that he was at the beginning of his three-year contract. GERTY confirms his memories of his wife and daughter are implanted.\n\nThe two Sams search the area, finding a communications substation beyond the facility's perimeter which has been interfering with the live feed from Earth. GERTY helps the older Sam access the recorded logs of past Sam clones, showing them all falling ill as their contract expires. Later, the older Sam discovers a secret vault containing hundreds of hibernating clones. They determine that Lunar Industries is unethically using clones of the original Sam Bell to avoid the cost of training and transporting new astronauts, as well as deliberately [[Radio jamming|jamming]] the live feed in order to prevent the clones from contacting Earth; clones who believe they are entering the final hibernation at the end of their contract just before their final return to Earth are in fact [[cremation|incinerated]]. The older Sam clone drives past the interference radius in a second rover and tries to call Tess on Earth. He instead makes contact with Eve, now 15 years old, who says Tess died \"some years ago\". He hangs up when Eve tells her father (offscreen, identified as \"Original Sam\" in [[closed captioning]]) that someone is calling regarding Tess. After he returns, the older Sam begins displaying the same symptoms as previous clones as they begin to deteriorate.\n\nThe two Sams realize that the incoming rescue team will kill them both if they are found together. The newer Sam convinces GERTY to wake another clone, planning to leave the awakened clone in the crashed rover and send the older Sam to Earth in one of the helium-3 transports. But the older Sam, having learned that the clones are designed to break down at the end of the 3-year contract, knows that he will not live much longer. With his health rapidly declining, the older Sam suggests that he be placed back into the crashed rover to die so that Lunar Industries will not suspect anything, while the newer Sam escapes instead.\n\nFollowing GERTY's advice, the newer Sam reboots GERTY to wipe its records of the events. Before leaving, the newer clone reprograms a harvester to crash and wreck the jamming antenna, thereby enabling live communications with Earth; he also brings along a canister of helium-3 to provide him with funds once he reaches Earth. The older Sam, back in the crippled rover, remains conscious long enough to watch the launch of the transport carrying the newer Sam to Earth. The rescue team is successfully fooled after finding both a newly-awakened clone in the medical bay and the corpse of the older Sam inside of the crashed rover.\n\nThe helium transport arrives at Earth, and over the film's credits, news reports describe how Sam's testimony on Lunar Industries' activities has stirred up an enormous controversy, and the company's [[business ethics|unethical practices]] have caused their stock to plummet.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Sam Bell\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as the voice of GERTY \n* [[Dominique McElligott]] as Tess Bell\n* [[Kaya Scodelario]] as Eve Bell\n** Rosie Shaw as Younger Eve\n* [[Benedict Wong]] as Thompson\n* [[Matt Berry]] as Overmeyers\n* [[Malcolm Stewart (actor)|Malcolm Stewart]] as the technician\n}}\n\n[[Robin Chalk]] appears as Rockwell's body double in portraying the Sam Bell clones.\n\n==Production==\nThis is the first feature film directed by [[television commercial|commercial]] director Duncan Jones, who co-wrote the script with Nathan Parker.<ref name=\"lands\">{{cite magazine |last=Siegel |first=Tatiana |url=https://variety.com/2008/film/markets-festivals/sony-lands-moon-rights-1117985128/ |title=Sony lands 'Moon' rights |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=5 May 2008 |access-date=18 March 2019 |archive-date=6 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506224255/http://variety.com/2008/film/markets-festivals/sony-lands-moon-rights-1117985128/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> The film was specifically written as a vehicle for actor Sam Rockwell.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Dawtrey |first=Adam |url=https://variety.com/2009/scene/markets-festivals/u-k-co-productions-storm-sundance-1117998560/ |title=U.K. co-productions storm Sundance |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=14 January 2009 |access-date=18 March 2019}}</ref> Rockwell almost turned the film down and [[Paddy Considine]] was an alternate choice.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=manmademoon |number=285518301742899201 |title=If Sam R decided last minute not to do the film, & that was a very real possibility, we were seeing if Paddy Considine would do it #Moonbbc2 |date=30 December 2012 |access-date=18 March 2019}}</ref> The film pays homage to the films of Jones' youth, such as ''[[Silent Running]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', and ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]''.<ref name=\"empire\">{{cite news |title=News Etc. |work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |date=February 2009 |pages=20\u201321}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired.com]]'', speaking about those films, Jones stated it was his \"intent to write for a science fiction-literate audience\" and that he \"wanted to make a film which would be appreciated by people like myself who loved those films\".<ref>{{cite magazine |title=''Moon'' Is Duncan Jones' Homage to Classic Sci-Fi |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/06/duncan-jones-moon/ |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired.com]] |location=San Francisco |date=12 June 2009 |access-date=18 March 2019}}</ref> Conceptual design was from [[Gavin Rothery (film creator)|Gavin Rothery]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Gavin Rothery {{!}} ARCHIVE |url=https://www.starburstmagazine.com/features/gavin-rothery-archive |website=STARBURST Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Moon |url=http://www.gavinrothery.com/el-panamericano |website=Gavin Rothery}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Episode 20 \u2013 Gavin Rothery \u2013 Director of Archive (2020) \u2013 Filmumentaries |url=https://filmumentaries.com/2021/03/episode-20-gavin-rothery-director-of-archive-2020/}}</ref>\n\nJones described his interest in the lunar setting:\n{{blockquote|[We] wanted to create something which felt comfortable within that canon of those science fiction films from the sort of late seventies to early eighties.<ref name=\"exl\"/> For me, the Moon has this weird mythic nature to it. ...
