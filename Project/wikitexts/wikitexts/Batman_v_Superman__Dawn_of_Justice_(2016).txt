Goyer]], and features an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Ben Affleck]] as [[Batman (DC Extended Universe)|Batman]] and [[Henry Cavill]] as [[Superman (DC Extended Universe)|Superman]], alongside [[Amy Adams]], [[Jesse Eisenberg]], [[Diane Lane]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Jeremy Irons]], [[Holly Hunter]], and [[Gal Gadot]]. ''Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'' is the first live-action film to feature Batman and Superman together, as well as the first live-action cinematic portrayal of [[Wonder Woman]]. In the film, criminal mastermind [[Lex Luthor (DC Extended Universe)|Lex Luthor]] manipulates Batman into a preemptive battle with Superman, who Luthor is obsessed with destroying.\n\nThe film was announced at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]] after the release of ''Man of Steel''. Snyder stated that the film would take inspiration from the ''Batman'' comic book series ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' by [[Frank Miller]] but clarified that it would follow an original premise. The incarnation of Batman in the film is different from the character's previous portrayal by [[Christian Bale]] in ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'', serving as a cinematic [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the character. The film is also inspired by narrative elements from the \"[[The Death of Superman|Death of Superman]]\". Pre-production began at [[East Los Angeles College]] in October 2013 and [[principal photography]] started in May 2014 in [[Detroit]]. Additional filming also took place in [[Illinois]] and [[New Mexico]], concluding that December.\n\n''Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'' premiered at the [[National Auditorium|Auditorio Nacional]] in [[Mexico City]] on March 19, 2016, and was released in the United States on March 25, 2016. Following a strong debut that set new box office records, the film experienced a historic drop in its [[Second weekend in box office performance|second weekend]] and never recovered. Despite grossing $873.6 million worldwide and turning in a profit, it performed below expectations and received generally unfavorable reviews from critics. An [[Director's cut#Extended cuts and special editions|extended cut]], dubbed the \"Ultimate Edition\", features 31 minutes of additional footage and was released to home media formats later in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400-700 words.

Years later in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], Bruce witnesses the Kryptonian attack, as well as the fight between [[Superman]] and [[General Zod (DC Extended Universe)|General Zod]], becoming visibly upset as the destruction of the city mounts.{{refn|name=MoS|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013).}} Eighteen months later, Superman has become a controversial figure. Bruce, who has been operating in [[Gotham City]] as the vigilante [[Batman]] for twenty years, sees Superman as a threat to humanity. After learning of Batman's form of justice, [[Superman (DC Extended Universe)|Clark Kent]] (Superman's civilian identity) seeks to expose him via ''[[Daily Planet]]'' articles. \n\nWayne learns that Russian weapon trafficker [[KGBeast|Anatoli Knyazev]] has been working with [[LexCorp]] mogul [[Lex Luthor (DC Extended Universe)|Lex Luthor]] to bring [[kryptonite]], discovered after Zod's [[terraforming]] attempt, into the United States. Luthor attempts to persuade Senator June Finch to allow him to import kryptonite so that it can be used as a deterrent against future Kryptonian and [[metahuman]] threats. She declines, but Luthor makes alternative plans with Finch's subordinate, granting him access to Zod's body and the Kryptonian scout ship. Bruce attends a gala at LexCorp to steal encrypted data from the company's mainframe, but antiquities dealer [[Diana Prince (DC Extended Universe)|Diana Prince]] takes it from him; she returns it after failing to access the information. \n\nWhile decrypting the drive, Bruce dreams of a post-apocalyptic world where he leads rebels against an evil Superman. He is awakened by an unidentified person, appearing through a portal, who tells him that [[Lois Lane (DC Extended Universe)|Lois Lane]] \"is the key\" and urges him to find \"the others\" before vanishing.{{refn|name=Timeline1|group=N|Although the film never explicitly identifies the mysterious man nor where he comes from, producer Deborah Snyder has confirmed that he is [[Barry Allen (DC Extended Universe)|the Flash]] traveling back in time, played by [[Ezra Miller]].

One is Diana, who appears in a photo from [[World War I]]. Wayne tells [[Alfred Pennyworth]] that he plans to steal and weaponize the kryptonite to use against Superman.\n\nA widely publicized congressional hearing, led by Finch, is held to question Superman's actions over the past 18 months. A bomb smuggled in by Luthor detonates, killing everyone present except Superman. Superman blames himself for not detecting it in time and self-imposes exile. Elsewhere, Batman breaks into LexCorp and steals the kryptonite. He builds a [[powered exoskeleton]], a kryptonite [[grenade launcher]], and a kryptonite-tipped spear. Meanwhile, Luthor enters the Kryptonian ship and accesses its vast database of technology. Luthor lures Superman out of exile by kidnapping Lois and [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Martha Kent]], Clark's adoptive mother. Superman confronts Luthor, who reveals he manipulated him and Batman by fueling their distrust for each other. Luthor demands he kill Batman in exchange for Martha's life. \n\nSuperman tries to explain the truth to Batman, who instead attacks him and eventually subdues him using a kryptonite gas. As Batman prepares to move in for the kill using the spear, Superman pleads with him to \"save Martha\"\u2014the same name as [[Martha Wayne|Batman's mother]]. Batman, flashing back to his parents' death, hesitates in confusion long enough for Lois to arrive and explain what Superman meant. Coming to his senses about how far he has fallen from grace, he promises to rescue Martha. Superman regains his strength and confronts Luthor on the scout ship. Luthor executes his backup plan, unleashing a monster genetically engineered from DNA from both Zod's body and his own.{{refn|name=Timeline2|group=N|While never identified on-screen or in the credits, beyond Luthor telling Superman the creature is \"your doomsday\",<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://time.com/4268441/batman-v-superman-ending-monster/ |title=Explaining That Monster at the End of 'Batman v Superman' |last=Dockterman |first=Eliana |date=March 27, 2016 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=February 28, 2018}}</ref> actor [[Robin Atkin Downes]] has identified the character as [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]].<ref name=\"Downes\">{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/Robin_A_Downes/status/703245558652080129 |title=Very proud to release that I helped bring #Doomsday to life in the upcoming @BatmanvSuperman #Dreamgigs |author-link=Robin Atkin Downes |last=Downes |first=Robin Atkin |date=February 27, 2016 |publisher=[[Twitter]] |access-date=February 26, 2016}}</ref>}} Diana arrives, revealing her superhuman abilities, and joins Batman and Superman in their fight against the creature. Superman realizes its vulnerability to kryptonite and retrieves the spear, fatally impaling the creature with it. In its dying moments, the creature stabs Superman, who was weakened by kryptonite exposure, killing him.\n\nFollowing Luthor's arrest, Batman confronts him in prison, warning him that he will always be watching. Luthor gloats that Superman's death has made the world vulnerable to powerful alien threats. A memorial is held for Superman in Metropolis. Clark is also declared dead, and Bruce and Diana both attend his funeral in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]]. Martha gives Lois an envelope containing an engagement ring from Clark. Bruce tells Diana that he regrets having failed Superman in life. He asks her help to form a team of metahumans,<!-- Do no pipelink team of metahumans with Justice League as this is an easter egg link.

On Batman's suit, Zack Snyder commented \"I had a really strong idea about what I wanted to do \u2013 I really wanted to do sort of a fabric-based Batman; not what's become the more normal, armored Batman.

Affleck stated a well known billionaire would likely have his voice recognized. When asked what makes this Batman different from the previous portrayals, Affleck said this Batman \"is a little older, he's a little more world-weary. He's been around the block once or twice so he's a little wiser but he's definitely more cynical and a little darker and more jaded\", adding that Batman has gotten \"more exposed to the violence and the criminal element of that world over time.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://batman-news.com/2016/03/18/ben-affleck-batman-v-superman-armored-suit/|title=Ben Affleck talks 'Batman v Superman' and what it was like in the \"heavy\" armored Batsuit (video)|first=Chris|last=Begley|date=March 18, 2016|access-date=August 13, 2016}}</ref> The film's Batman was influenced by [[Frank Miller]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', which shows Batman in his 50s.

Brody feels this notion is supported by the fact that Batman's eyes glow blue when he is wearing the exoskeleton and Superman's glow red when he uses his [[Heat vision (fiction)|heat vision]].<ref name=\"NY: DemsVReps\" />  Brody criticized this allegory as \"salacious\" for suggesting that the Democratic Party allies itself with evil, which he says \"has no relationship to contemporary politics\".<ref name=\"NY: DemsVReps\" /> However, he called it \"a powerful metaphor\" for suggesting \"there'd be much less of an urge to find a superhero\u2014or to magnify demagogues who pretend to be one\u2014if politicians merely did their jobs competently and sensitively.\"<ref name=\"NY: DemsVReps\" />\n\nMark Hughes writing for ''[[Forbes]]'' notes that the film inverts the politics of ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' by having Superman as the outsider character who is questioned by the government and media. He writes \"This is a reversal of sorts from [[The Dark Knight Returns|the comic]], where Superman represents the establishment perspective while Batman is the outcast under constant press, public, and government scrutiny.\"<ref name=\"Hughes\" /> He also noted how Batman sees Superman as human for the first time during the Martha scene: \"he's never looked at Superman as a real person or as a man before. Then suddenly Superman is vulnerable, he has a regular guy's name and a woman who loves him crying over him, and a mom \u2013 his last words are basically \"save my mother.\" We see, very emotionally, how Batman realizes what he's doing and that he's the bad guy, a painful but very human revelatory moment.\"<ref name=\"Hughes\" />\n\nRichard Newby writing for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', wrote the Martha scene \"is Bruce's opportunity to reconnect with his own humanity and the humanity of Superman. Batman doesn\u2019t end the fight because their mothers have the same name, but because he recognizes Superman as someone with a mother, and thus a human, despite his alien origins. The battle against Superman is ultimately Bruce\u2019s realization that he can be better and reconnect with humanity again.
