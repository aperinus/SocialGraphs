The film was directed by [[Peter Hewitt (film director)|Peter Hewitt]] and produced/co-written by [[Stephen Sommers]] (who also worked on Disney's adaptation of Twain's [[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|1884 novel]], 1993's ''[[The Adventures of Huck Finn (1993 film)|The Adventures of Huck Finn]]''). The movie was released in North America on December 22, 1995.<ref name=bomojo/>\n\nIn the film, mischievous young [[Tom Sawyer]] witnesses a murder by a vicious half-[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] criminal known as \"Injun Joe\". Tom befriends [[Huckleberry Finn|Huck Finn]], a boy with no future and no family, and is forced to choose between honoring a friendship or honoring an oath, when the town drunk is accused of the murder.\n\n==Plot==\nOne dark stormy night, Injun Joe goes to meet Doctor Jonas Robinson for some shady business. Meanwhile, a young boy name Tom Sawyer is runs away from home with his friends to become steamboat men. This ultimately fails as their raft collides on a rock in the [[Mississippi River]], throwing Tom into the water. His friends find him washed up on the shore, and Tom finds it was Huck Finn who carried him to safety. Tom later meets Huck discovering an unusual way to remove warts - by taking a dead cat to the graveyard at night. There they witness Injun Joe and Muff Potter, the town drunk, digging up the grave of Vic \"One-Eyed\" Murrell for Doctor Robinson. A treasure map is discovered and Doc assaults Muff and Injun Joe in an attempt to take it for himself. Doc manages to knock out Muff, but Injun Joe fights back by fatally stabbing Doc with Muff's knife.\n\nThe next morning, Muff is charged for the murder. Tom and Huck had signed an oath saying that if either of them came forward about it, they would drop dead and rot. The boys embark on a search for the treasure map Injun Joe has, so they can declare Muff innocent while preserving their oath. Eventually however, Joe finds the last treasure and asks his partner to hide the treasure in a cave before burning the map. With the only evidence to prove Muff's innocence destroyed, Tom and Huck's friendship starts to decline, and Huck eventually leaves Hannibal. Joe then discovers that Tom was a witness to the crime. He finds Tom and threatens he will kill him if he ever tells anyone about the murder. \n\nAt Muff Potter's trial, Tom decides that his friendship with Muff is more important than his oath with Huck and exposes the truth. Injun Joe in fury, unsuccessfully attempts to kill Tom before leaving Hannibal. The townspeople declares Tom as a hero for his bravery and plans to throw a festival to commemorate the occasion. Tom, however, knowing Joe is after him, refuses to attend. Huck later sneaks into Tom's bedroom one night, criticizing Tom for breaking their oath before leaving town again.\n\nThe next day during the festival, a group of children, including Tom and his love interest Becky Thatcher, enter the caves, where Tom and Becky become lost. Meanwhile, the judge is alerted by the sheriff that Joe ended up killing one of his partners. Huck, who secretly attends the festival, overhears all this and goes after Tom. They eventually stumble upon Injun Joe in McDougal's Cave. He traps them, but Tom and Becky manage to escape. Tom later discovers the spot where Joe hid his treasure. He then finds an opening in the cave and asks Becky to get her father.\n\nInjun Joe ultimately finds Tom and attempts to kill him before Huck suddenly shows up. After a brief struggle, Injun Joe easily overpowers Huck. Just as Joe is about land a finishing blow, Tom quietly empties the contents from the treasure chest and threatens Joe by throwing the treasure chest over a chasm. Injun Joe then tries to get the chest from Tom, only to fall into the chasm to his death. The boys reconcile as they claim Joe's treasure, and are declared heroes by the people. Tom is praised on the front page of the newspaper, and Widow Douglas adopts Huck Finn.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]] as [[Thomas Sawyer|Thomas \"Tom\" Sawyer]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-12-21/entertainment/ca-16219_1_jonathan-taylor-thomas|title=Little Big Man : Heartthrob and Hot Property at 14, Taylor Has a Veteran's View of Hollywood|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1995-12-21|access-date=2012-06-14|first=Claudia|last=Puig}}</ref>\n*[[Brad Renfro]] as [[Huckleberry Finn|Huckleberry \"Huck\" Finn]]\n*[[Eric Schweig]] as Injun Joe\n*[[Charles Rocket]] as Judge Thatcher: Becky's father\n*[[Amy Wright]] as Aunt Polly: Tom's maternal aunt\n*[[Mike McShane]] as Muff Potter\n*[[Marian Seldes]] as Widow Douglas: Huck's adoptive mother\n*[[Rachael Leigh Cook]] as Rebecca \"Becky\" Thatcher: Tom's love interest\n*[[Courtland Mead]] as Sid Sawyer: Tom's younger brother\n*Joey Stinson as Joseph \"Joe\" Harper \n*[[Blake Heron]] as Benjamin \"Ben\" Rodgers\n*[[Lanny Flaherty]] as Emmett: Injun Joe's accomplice.\n*Peter MacKenzie as Mr. Sneed\n*[[Heath Lamberts]] as Mr. Dobbins\n*[[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]] as Doctor Jonas Robinson\n*[[Andrew Stahl|Andy Stahl]] as Sheriff\n*[[Bronwen Murray]] as Cousin Mary: Tom's maternal cousin\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nIn its opening weekend the film grossed $3,210,458 million in 1,609 theaters in the United States and Canada, debuting number 9 of box office.<ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office : 'Exhale' Blows Down the Competition|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1995-12-27|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1995-12-27/entertainment/ca-18149_1_weekend-gross|access-date=2012-06-14|first=Elaine|last=Dutka}}</ref> In its second week it rose to No. 8 grossed \t$6,789,871 million.<ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office : A Very Happy New Year's Holiday for 'Toy Story' and 'Jumanji'|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date= 1996-01-03|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-03/entertainment/ca-20514_1_toy-story|access-date=2012-06-14|first=Claudia|last=Puig}}</ref> The U.S. and Canada box office for ''Tom and Huck'' was $23,920,048.<ref name=bomojo/>\n\n===Critical===\nThe film received mixed to negative reviews,<ref>{{cite news|title=MOVIE REVIEW : A Darker 'Tom and Huck' for a Modern Audience|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1995-12-22|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-12-22/entertainment/ca-16735_1_tom-sawyer|access-date=2012-06-14|first=John|last=Anderson}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=FILM REVIEW;Tom Sawyer as Gable|work=The New York Times|date=1995-12-22|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B00E3DF1539F931A15751C1A963958260|access-date=2012-06-14|first=Stephen|last=Holden}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=FILM REVIEW -- A Likable Tom and Huck, With an Eerily '90s Twist|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=1995-12-22|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/12/22/DD69845.DTL#ixzz1xjFeKaYX|access-date=2012-06-14|first=Peter|last=Stack}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='Tom And Huck' A Silly Take On Twain's Classic Tale|publisher= Chicago Tribune|date=1995-12-22|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-12-22/entertainment/9512220017_1_adventures-of-tom-sawyer-aunt-polly-scene|access-date=2012-06-14|first=John|last=Petrakis}}</ref> with a 'rotten' 25% on review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes.<ref>{{Rotten Tomatoes|tom_and_huck}}</ref>\n\n=== Accolades ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |Awards\n|-\n!width=130|Group\n!Category\n!width=110|Recipient(s)\n!Outcome\n|-\n|[[First Americans in the Arts]]\n| Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role (Film)\n|[[Eric Schweig]]\n|{{won}}\n\n|-\n|[[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]]\n| Favorite Movie Actor\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]]\n|{{nom}}\n\n|-\n|[[Young Artist Award]]s\n|Best Young Leading Actor - Feature Film\n|{{nom}}\n\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | [[YoungStar Award]]s\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Best Performance by a Young Actor in a Comedy Film\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Brad Renfro]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Performance by a Young Actress in a Comedy Film\n| Rachael Leigh Cook\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was released in VHS and LaserDisc on May 1, 1996, in DVD on May 6, 2003, on February 10, 2009 was released double feature with ''[[The Adventures of Huck Finn (1993 film)|The Adventures of Huck Finn]]'' (1993) and also in Blu-Ray on July 13, 2021.
