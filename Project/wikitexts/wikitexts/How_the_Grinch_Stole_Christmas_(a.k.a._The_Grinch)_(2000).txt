Seaman]]. The film is based on [[Dr. Seuss]]'s [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!|1957 children's book of the same name]] and is the first Dr. Seuss book to be adapted into a full-length feature film, following [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|the 1966 animated TV special of the same name]] as the second adaptation of the book. The film is narrated by [[Anthony Hopkins]] and stars [[Jim Carrey]] as the eponymous character, with [[Jeffrey Tambor]], [[Christine Baranski]], [[Bill Irwin]] and [[Molly Shannon]] in supporting roles.\n\nProduced by [[Imagine Entertainment]], ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas'' was released by [[Universal Pictures]] in the United States on November 17, 2000. The film earned mixed reviews from critics, who praised Jim Carrey's performance, but criticized its darker theme and somewhat scary moments, as well as deviating from the source material too drastically. It spent four weeks as the #1 film in the United States. ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas'' grossed $345 million worldwide, making it the [[2000 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest grossing film of 2000]] and originally becoming the second highest-grossing holiday film of all-time behind ''[[Home Alone]]'' (1990), until both films were surpassed in 2018 by the [[The Grinch (film)|third film adaptation of the story]].<ref name=\"BOM\"/><ref>{{cite book| title=Guinness World Records 2007| url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec2007guin|url-access=registration| publisher=Guinness World Records Limited| year=2006| page=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec2007guin/page/n197 182] (UK edition)| chapter=Arts & Media| isbn=978-1-9049-9412-1}}</ref> It won the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Academy Award for Best Makeup]] as well as getting nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please refer to WP:FILMPLOT before editing. Plots for films should be between 400-700 words. Also see [[User:NinjaRobotPirate/How to streamline a plot summary]] for excellent tips. -->\nEvery Who down in [[Whoville]] really likes [[Christmas]]. However, the Whos dislike the Grinch, a [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] green creature who lives in a cave on nearby Mount Crumpit, north of Whoville, because of his mean-spiritedness, especially during the holiday season. Six-year-old Cindy Lou Who believes that everyone is focusing more on gifts and festivities rather than personal relationships. She encounters the Grinch at the post office (while he plays with the mail by switching everything around as well as throwing unpleasant jury duty notices into random mailboxes), where he saves her life after getting stuck in the mail shaft. Cindy starts researching the Grinch and later discovers more of his past.\n\nThe Grinch arrived in Whoville as a baby and was adopted by two elderly sisters. In school, the then-timid Grinch was attracted to Martha May Whovier, a girl in his class who reciprocated his feelings. Classmate Augustus MayWho, however, started bullying him, jealous that Martha favored the Grinch over him. That Christmas, he made an angel as a gift for Martha, but accidentally cut his face while trying to shave due to MayWho claiming he had a beard. When MayWho and their other classmates saw his cut face the next day, they (except Martha) teased him, causing him to lose his temper, declare his hatred for Christmas, and flee to Mount Crumpit, where he has resided since.\n\nCindy nominates the Grinch as the town's \"Holiday Cheermeister\", outraging MayWho, now mayor. Cindy climbs to Mount Crumpit to invite the Grinch to the celebration, and he eventually accepts, realizing he could potentially encounter Martha there and finally upset MayWho. As Cheermeister, the Grinch participates in several events and begins enjoying himself until MayWho presents him with an electric razor, reminding him of his childhood humiliation. MayWho then publicly proposes to Martha, giving her a gaudy engagement ring and a new car. Enraged, the Grinch berates the Whos' materialism, mocking their belief that Christmas is only about gifts that will ultimately be discarded. He shaves MayWho's head, burns down the tree with a makeshift flamethrower (the Whos, however, have a spare) and goes on a rampage before returning home.\n\nDisgusted with the Whos' Christmas, the Grinch vows to crush their spirit by stealing all of their presents, decorations and food while they are asleep. He disguises himself as [[Santa Claus]] and his pet dog Max as a [[reindeer]], then descends into Whoville. The first house he enters is Cindy's, and when she catches him stealing their tree, he lies to her to facilitate his escape. The Grinch continues stealing all of the gifts, decorations and food and stuffing them all in a large sack, before climbing back atop Mount Crumpit to destroy it all by pushing the sack off the side. Upon awakening on Christmas morning, the Whos horrifyingly discover the theft and Mayor MayWho blames Cindy for enabling the Grinch to ruin the town's spirit. However, her cheerful father, town postmaster Lou Lou Who, defends her by informing MayWho and the others that Cindy has been trying to tell them that Christmas mainly involves time with family and friends, not just gifts and fancy decorations. The Whos agree with Lou and start singing Whoville's Christmas carol.\n\nBefore the Grinch can push the sack off the top of Mount Crumpit, he hears the Whos singing and realizes that he has failed to prevent Christmas, but then figures out the true meaning of Christmas, causing his heart to grow three sizes, and breaks down in tears. The sleigh full of gifts then begins to slide over the edge of the cliff along with Cindy, who had come to spend Christmas with him. The Grinch gets the strength to lift the loaded sleigh and carry Cindy to safety, and they ride down the mountain to return everything. The Grinch apologizes for his pranks and the burglary before surrendering himself to the police, who accept his apology and deny MayWho's request to arrest and [[pepper spray]] him. Martha even rejects MayWho's proposal and returns his engagement ring to him, declaring that she loves the Grinch. Afterwards, the reformed Grinch joins in the Whos' celebration feast and carves the roast beast himself in his cave.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as the [[Grinch]], a bad-tempered, devious and misanthropic green-furred creature who despises Christmas and the Whos of Whoville. It is revealed in his origin story that he started to hate Christmas after his school classmates mocked him for his appearance, and for some cuts he sustained when trying to shave his face.

Geisel visited the set in October 1999. Much of the Whoville set was constructed on the backlot of [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal Studios]] behind the Bates Motel set from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. [[Rick Baker]] was hired to design and create the film's prosthetic makeup for Carrey and the rest of the cast. It took a number of tests, and ultimately Carrey admiring a photo of Baker in his first test makeup, for the decision to use Baker's original makeup design. The Grinch suit was covered in yak hair, dyed green and sewed onto a spandex suit. The application of the makeup took up to 2 and a half hours, after which a frustrated Carrey kicked a hole in the wall of his trailer. Carrey's makeup artist [[Kazu Hiro]] recounted, \"On set, [Carrey] was really mean to everybody and at the beginning of the production they couldn't finish. After two weeks we only could finish three days' worth of shooting schedule, because suddenly he would just disappear and when he came back, everything was ripped apart. We couldn't shoot anything.\" Kazu Hiro left production until Baker and Howard had a discussion with Carrey on how important Kazu Hiro was to the production.
