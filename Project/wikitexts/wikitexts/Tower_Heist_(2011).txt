The plot follows employees of an exclusive apartment building who lose their pensions in the [[Ponzi scheme]] of a [[Wall Street]] businessman and enlist the aid of a criminal, a bankrupt businessman, and an immigrant maid to break into his apartment and steal back their money while avoiding the FBI agents in charge of his case.\n\n''Tower Heist'' began development as early as 2005, based on an idea by Murphy that would star him and an all-black cast of comedians as a heist group who rob [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (New York City)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]]. As the script developed and changed into an ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]''&ndash;style caper, Murphy left the project. Ratner continued to develop the idea into what would eventually become ''Tower Heist'', with Murphy later rejoining the production. Filming took place entirely in [[New York City]] on a budget of $75&nbsp;million (after tax rebates), with several buildings provided by [[Donald Trump]] used to represent the eponymous tower. The film's soundtrack album and musical score was composed by [[Christophe Beck]] and produced by [[Jake Monaco]] and was released on November 1, 2011, by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]], [[Back Lot Music]] and Colosseum Records.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise going to the cast, including Broderick, Leoni, and Stiller. Murphy's performance was repeatedly singled out, with critics feeling that he displayed a welcome return to the comedic style of his early career. Much of the criticism was focused on the plot, which was considered \"formulaic\",<ref name=\"RevLevy\"/> \"rushed\",<ref name=\"RevVariety\"/> \"dull\"<ref name=\"RevEMpire\"/> and \"laborious\".<ref name=\"RevTHR\"/> The film was theatrically released on November 4, 2011, in the United States by [[Universal Pictures]] where it earned $152.9&nbsp;million<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo\"/> worldwide on a budget of $75\u201385&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo\"/><ref name=\"RatnerInterview\"/>\n\nPrior to release, the film was involved in a controversy over plans by Universal Pictures to release it for home viewing on [[video on demand]] to 500,000 [[Comcast]] customers, only three weeks after its cinematic debut. Concern over the implementation's harming ticket sales and inspiring further films to follow suit resulted in several theater chains' refusal to show the film at all if the plan went ahead, forcing Universal to abandon the idea.\n\nThis was one of [[Heavy D|Heavy D's]] final roles before he died.<ref name=\"CastHeavyD1\"/><ref name=\"CastHeavyD2\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--On May 4, 2021, this plot section was reduced from 766 to 544 words. Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot sections must be between 400 to 700 words and cannot just be a sequence of events. -->\n\nJosh Kovaks is the [[building manager]] of The Tower, an upscale apartment complex in [[New York City]] that has Wall Street billionaire Arthur Shaw as its penthouse tenant. The Tower staff lose all their pensions because Josh gave them to Shaw, who is under [[house arrest]] by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] for masterminding a [[Ponzi scheme]], embezzling up to $2 billion. Josh, his brother-in-law and The Tower's [[concierge]] Charlie, and elevator operator Enrique are fired after attempting to confront Shaw for his scheme.\n\nThe FBI agent in charge of Shaw's case, Claire Denham, drunkenly suggests to Josh that Shaw has concealed $20 million as a reserve, and that he should steal it. Josh gets Charlie, Enrique, and evicted Tower tenant Mr. Fitzhugh to help him steal the money.\n\nThey supplement their inexperience by enlisting Josh's childhood friend Slide, a petty criminal, and the tower's [[maid]] Odessa Montero, who has [[locksmith]] experience. Denham informs Josh that Shaw is scheduled to attend court on [[Thanksgiving]] during the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] to avoid publicity, so Josh and his team decide to break into Shaw's apartment then. Prior to this, Charlie is rehired as The Tower's new manager, and, uncomfortable with the plan, warns Josh to abandon it, or Charlie will turn him over to the police.\n\nSlide attempts to betray the team by reaching the safe ahead of them and taking all of the money for himself, having tricked Odessa into giving him lessons. The team intercepts him at Shaw's apartment and break down a false wall, revealing Shaw's safe, which turns out to be empty. During the ensuing altercation, the group find gold underneath the paint of a [[Ferrari 250 GT Lusso]] which Shaw has displayed in his apartment, realizing that he invested his money in gold, turned it into car parts, and reassembled the car inside the apartment piece by piece to hide the money in plain sight, which, according to Fitzhugh, is worth about $45 million (give or take $10 million) in total. They then decide to lower it to Fitzhugh's old apartment using a window-washing platform. Charlie rejoins the team after realizing their presence and saves Fitzhugh from falling to his death. They push the car on top of one of the elevators, and Josh finds a ledger of Shaw's illegal finances in the car's glove box.\n\nShaw and the FBI return, realizing the Thanksgiving Day court date to be part of Josh's plan. Denham notes the missing car and Shaw's hidden safe and forfeits his $10 million bail and remands him into federal custody until his real court date for not informing the FBI of the safe. The FBI arrests Josh's conspirators (except Slide, who somehow manages to slip away) while Denham catches up to Josh in [[Central Park]]. In the [[Police van|paddy wagon]], Josh reveals to Shaw that he found the ledger. Shaw tries to negotiate a deal with them by giving them cash ten times the value of the gold car in exchange for their silence. They decline Shaw's bribe by reminding him \"they don't accept tips at The Tower.\"\n\nAt FBI HQ, Director Mazin and Denham mention to Josh that they know about his friendship with Slide. Tower [[receptionist]] Miss Iovenko tells Director Mazin that she passed her [[New York State Bar Association|bar exam]] three days before and will be Josh's attorney. She shows them Shaw's ledger with evidence that will put him away for life, and tells them she will turn it over in exchange for everyone's freedom. Mazin accepts on the condition that Josh serve a minimal two-year sentence for masterminding the heist.\n\nA news report states that Shaw will enter a [[guilty plea]]. Slide leads the retrieval of the car from the Tower's swimming pool. Its various dismantled parts are sent to Tower employees to compensate for their lost pensions while splitting the remainder of the gold among themselves. While Shaw begins his life sentence, Josh enters his cell with a satisfied smile slowly forming on his face.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 150\n| footer    = Top to bottom: Ben Stiller, Matthew Broderick, and Alan Alda star in the film.\n| image1    = Ben Stiller in NYC Cropped.jpg\n| image2    = Matthew Broderick portrait 2009 cropped.jpg\n| image3    = Alan Alda by Bridget Laudien Cropped.jpg\n}}\n\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Josh Kovaks, The Tower's building manager.

Plus, who could have known that, in this period of time, the global financial markets would teeter on the verge of collapse and the villain in our story would pale in comparison to some very real ones on Wall Street? Truth remains stranger than fiction.\"{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=5}}\n\nRewrites of the script gradually moved away from the ensemble of comedians and began to focus on two central characters, at which point Murphy left the project. The modified script reminded Ratner of the ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'' remake, a project he had developed but for which he was unavailable due to his commitment to directing ''[[Rush Hour 2]]''.<ref name=\"RatnerInterview\"/><ref name=\"Development2\"/> The project remained in development for a period of years but Ratner remained committed to the project, having enjoyed the heist films of the 1970s including ''[[The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974 film)|The Taking of Pelham One Two Three]]'', ''[[The Hot Rock (film)|The Hot Rock]]'', and ''[[The Anderson Tapes]]'',{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=4}} turning down the opportunity to direct other films such as ''[[Horrible Bosses]]'', which he instead produced.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=25}}<ref name=\"THRRatner\"/> Ratner also wanted to work with Murphy, whom Ratner partially credited as inspiring his ''Rush Hour'' films.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=4}} As the script began to be finalized, Murphy was drawn back into the much changed project after being informed of Stiller's participation, with Murphy being offered the role of Slide. Murphy rejoined as both a cast member and producer, alongside Grazer and Kim Roth.<ref name=\"RatnerInterview\"/>{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=4}} In late October 2010, the film was finally scheduled for release, being given a November 4, 2011, release date.<ref name=\"Development5\"/>\n\n===Writing===\nFeeling the original concept was too close to ''Ocean's Eleven'',<ref name=\"RatnerInterview2\"/> Ratner attempted to recruit ''Rush Hour'' screenwriter Nathanson to perform additional work on the ''Tower Heist'' script, but at that time Nathanson was unavailable. Ratner instead hired Griffin, a writer on the ''Ocean's Eleven'' remake. Griffin \"brought the real motivation and the heart to the concept\", moving away from the premise of performing an ensemble heist on a rich Donald Trump type,<ref name=\"RatnerInterview2\"/><ref name=\"Development2\"/> and focusing instead on a group of blue-collar employees who take on a corrupt, thieving [[Bernard Madoff]] like businessman who has embezzled their pensions.<ref name=\"RatnerInterview2\"/> Ratner enjoyed the pitch and brought it to Grazer who gave his approval.<ref name=\"Development2\"/> After taking the script to Stiller and bringing him into the project, Ratner had [[Noah Baumbach]] perform specific rewrites for Stiller's character.<ref name=\"Development2\"/> Nathanson then came aboard the project and performed the final rewrites to Griffin's screenplay in October 2010,<ref name=\"RatnerInterview\"/><ref name=\"Murphy2\"/><ref name=\"Development2\"/> adding \"the obstacles, complexities and specificities of the characters\".<ref name=\"RevLevy\"/>\n\nTo help develop the script, the filmmakers and writers spoke with the resident managers of several high-profile New York hotels to learn of their experiences interacting with their clientele. This research gave Griffin the idea for Shaw's possessing a vehicle in his apartment, which Grazer and Ratner eventually decided would be a rare 1963 Ferrari 250 GT Lusso which once belonged to [[Steve McQueen]].{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=12}} On his research, Nathanson said \"It was informative, to say the least, to speak with the people who work in these buildings. I interviewed everyone from doormen to housekeepers to building managers. There's a whole underworld to the New York building scene that exists in the basements that most people are unaware of. They make it all possible, and you just never see it. It's fascinating.\"{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=10}}\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Tower Heist marching band jeh.theora.ogv|thumb|Filming recreates the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] on location in New York City for the climax of the heist.]]\nFilming began in November 2010, taking place entirely in New York City<ref name=\"Development3\"/> on a budget of $85&nbsp;million ($75&nbsp;million after tax rebates).<ref name=\"RatnerInterview\"/><ref name=\"LABox\"/> Production designer [[Kristi Zea]] visited several upscale hotels and high-rise residences to research the design elements to incorporate into the opulent surroundings of the tower and Shaw's penthouse. Zea created an amalgamation of the elements she saw during her research to create a sophisticated lobby design for the tower. For Shaw's penthouse, Zea took inspiration from a top-floor apartment in the [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (New York City)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]] at [[Central Park West]] in [[Columbus Circle]].{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=10-11}} Zea populated the apartment with an assortment of art pieces to represent Shaw's status, based on specific artists and works that Ratner suggested. Zea decided to use modern-classic reproduction designs by artists such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Cy Twombly]], and [[Andy Warhol]].{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=11}} Explaining her decision, Zea said \"These days, it seems wealthy people want to have wall power. They want to have art on their walls that means something and shows people, just like a car, that, 'I'm rich, I'm smart and I know what I'm doing.{{'\"}}{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=11}}\n\nDonald Trump allowed the production to use several of his own properties to portray the luxurious locales with the [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (New York City)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]] being used for exterior shots of the tower.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=11}} Sections of the building were recreated on closed [[Chroma key|green screen]] sets for some of the film's visual effects.<ref name=\"FilmingVFX\"/> A foot and car chase sequence was filmed on [[Central Park West]] and [[Columbus Avenue (Manhattan)|Columbus Avenue]].{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=11}} Some vehicle filming occurred on sound stages in [[Brooklyn]].{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=13}} The burglary itself takes place during the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]], requiring the crew to film parts of the actual parade itself, and then recreate the event one week later for further filming.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=14}}\n\nFor Shaw's Ferrari, it was decided that purchasing an actual model&nbsp;&ndash; of which only 350 exist and would cost at least $1&nbsp;million&nbsp;&ndash; would be too expensive and the vehicle would be unsuitable for filming purposes. Instead, two replicas were commissioned, a process which took three months under the supervision of prop master Peter Gelfman. The replicas then received additional reinforcement for filming purposes from Steve Kirshoff and the special effects crew. After running camera tests on several authentic Ferrari colors, it was decided to paint the replicas bright red in order to create a lasting impression instead of using the actual metallic brown muted-coloring of McQueen's vehicle.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=12-13}} Sidibe and Murphy performed the only improvised scene, in which they are cracking a safe together.<ref name=\"RatnerInterview2\"/> Test screenings did not result in any scenes being cut from the film, with Ratner claiming that the theatrical version is his \"director's cut\".<ref name=\"RatnerInterview2\"/> He did remove some scenes which he felt \"didn't fit\", or did not match the [[PG-13 (Motion Picture Association)|PG-13]] rating the filmmakers were targeting.<ref name=\"RatnerInterview2\"/> In post-production, Universal decided to film a new scene for the ending that would feature a reunion between Stiller and Murphy's characters. Murphy refused to return unless he was paid a further $500,000 on top of his $7.5&nbsp;million salary.

Universal Pictures projected opening takings of $25&ndash;30&nbsp;million during the opening weekend&nbsp;&ndash; aiming below expectations due to a slow marketplace&nbsp;&ndash; with rival studios claiming that the film would need to make at least $30&nbsp;million to be a success.<ref name=\"BoxOffice1\"/><ref name=\"BoxOffice2\"/> In the United States and Canada, ''Tower Heist'' opened in 3,367 theaters.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMidnight\"/> The film took $85,000 from midnight screenings and a total of $8.5&nbsp;million opening Friday, becoming the number one grossing film for the day.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMidnight\"/> Although the film had been expected to be the number one film for the weekend,<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMidnight\"/><ref name=\"BoxOfficeOpening1\"/> it took $10.5&nbsp;million on the opening Saturday, falling behind the animated film ''[[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|Puss in Boots]]'' ($15.3&nbsp;million).

The site's critics consensus reads: \"''Tower Heist'' is a true Brett Ratner joint: little brains to this caper, but it's fun fluff, exciting to watch, and showcases a welcome return to form for Eddie Murphy.\"<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\"/> [[Metacritic]] gave the film a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on reviews from 39 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMidnight\"/><ref name=\"BoxOfficeOpening1\"/>\n\nTim Robey of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' called the film \"a tolerably enjoyable Brett Ratner movie\", labeling it \"brash, forgettable fun\". He criticized Ratner for having the mostly white characters require the aid of a black character for the heist, saying \"it's a little embarrassing that they can't conceive of doing this without bailing a black criminal out of jail but cultural sensitivity has never been Ratner's strong suit.\"<ref name=\"RevTelegraph\"/> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'s}} Todd McCarthy said that the film is \"snappy, well cast and streetwise\" but felt that it ignored the \"contemporary economic issues at its core\". McCarthy said that Murphy's performance was a return to form as \"the rude, confrontational, wiseass Murphy audiences have nearly forgotten after all the silly kid comedies and heavy-makeup outings of recent years\", and said that with his introduction \"the film's energy and amusement level kick up a few notches\", but that the enjoyment ebbs during the actual break-in, in which \"Murphy becomes neutered&nbsp;... and the logistics of the heist become too far-fetched and laborious.\"<ref name=\"RevTHR\"/>\n\n''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''{{'}}s [[David Edelstein]] called it \"a shameless but exuberantly well-done caper comedy\", and praised the performances of Stiller, Murphy and Leoni, saying \"Ben Stiller&nbsp;... and Eddie Murphy&nbsp;... show off two of the best fastballs in comedy, and T\u00e9a Leoni's best scene as an FBI agent&nbsp;&ndash; drunk, both sloppy and blunt&nbsp;&ndash; makes you wish she had more.\"<ref name=\"RevNewYorker\"/> [[Emanuel Levy]] called ''Tower Heist'' a \"formulaic, haphazardly plotted action comedy&nbsp;... whose best asset is its strong ensemble.\" Levy said \"What makes the picture&nbsp;... work is not its plot, which is overly familiar and utterly implausible, but the socio-psychological dynamics that prevail among the [characters].\" Levy singled out Stiller as \"well cast\" and Sidibe as having \"some of the picture's best lines\", but gave individual praise to Murphy, saying that he \"dominates the second half of the picture\", rendering \"a joyous performance that recalls his witty, charming, streetwise roles of the 1980s\".<ref name=\"RevLevy\"/>\n\n''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''{{'}}s Nick de Semlyen awarded the film three out of five stars, calling it \"fun if uneven stuff from Ratner\", with a \"fairly dull\" opening act. Semlyen said it was \"a welcome return to form for Eddie Murphy\", but was critical that he is \"sorely underused\". Semlyen praised Alda, saying that it is his \"smarm offensive that turns out to be the primary pleasure\".<ref name=\"RevEMpire\"/> ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'}}s Nick Pinkteron said that the film \"deserves credit as a clean, well-turned job, fleet and funny and inconsequential\", and appreciated the cast, praising Leoni as the \"best thing going\", and Murphy's \"inspired\" contributions. Pinkerton was critical of the script, describing it as \"amateur as its crooks: the audience isn't even fully aware of who's in on the job when it kicks off, while other threads are left dangling.\"<ref name=\"RevVillageVoice\"/>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] awarded the film 2.5 out of 4, saying \"This isn't a great heist movie for a lot of reasons, beginning with the stupidity of its heist plan and the impossibility of these characters ever being successful at anything more complex than standing in line\", but appreciated that the comedy did not \"go heavy on the excremental, the masturbatory and symphonies of four-letter words\", calling it \"funny in an innocent screwball kind of way\".<ref name=\"RevEbert\"/> [[Lisa Schwarzbaum]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the film \"overblinged, eye-catching, and essentially tacky\", and praised Murphy, saying \"when Murphy is on screen, his comedic vigor&nbsp;... gooses the movie's energy level&nbsp;... but whenever Murphy wanders off, the movie's pulse rate drops. ''Tower Heist'' is in effect two movies: One belongs to Murphy, the other to the rest of the cast.\"<ref name=\"Schwarzbaum\"/> ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out London]]''{{'}}s Trevor Johnston said that \"though it's hard to get excited by this amiable potboiler, ''Tower Heist'' is so at home with its limitations it's equally hard to dislike\", but criticized the finale \"which might have been a bit more tense had we been able to take it remotely seriously\".<ref name=\"RevTimeOut\"/> ''Time Out New York''{{'}}s David Fear gave it 2 out of 5 stars, saying \"one nail-biting moment and some much-missed Murphy mouthiness won't keep you from feeling like you're the one being ripped off.\"<ref name=\"RevTimeOutNY\"/>\n\n''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'s}} [[Anthony Lane]] criticized the plot, saying \"toss everything you can find, starting with roughly diced plots, into the blender: such appears to be the method behind ''Tower Heist''.\" Lane called the characters \"unlikable people\" but offered praise to Broderick, saying he \"underplays [the character] so well\". Lane lamented that \"the notion of a theft from the thieves&nbsp;&ndash; from those who are lapped in lofty, screw you wealth&nbsp;&ndash; is a tempting one right now, but ''Tower Heist'' passes the buck.\"<ref name=\"RevTheNewYorker\"/> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Peter Debruge was also critical, saying the film \"goes wonky on the way to the bank, due to its lackluster pacing and shortage of the qualities that typically earn stars Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy their paychecks \u2013 namely, laughs.\" Debruge felt that the opening 40 minutes were \"a dull blue-collar drama populated entirely by stereotypes\", and while the film \"picks up some much-needed momentum\" with the actual heist, the \"resolution feels rushed\". Debruge echoed praise for Murphy, calling his performance \"a welcome return to the comic's irreverent, '80s-era persona\", and lamenting his limited screen-time.<ref name=\"RevVariety\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n''Tower Heist'' received two [[NAACP Image Award]] nominations, for [[NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Motion Picture|Outstanding Motion Picture]] and [[NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture|Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture]] for [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"AccoNAACP\" />\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n!
