The ''senpai'' plans to confess his romantic feelings for the ''k\u014dhai'' to her that night, though circumstances keep them separated for a majority of the evening.\n\nThe ''k\u014dhai'' meets a pervert, T\u014dd\u014d, at a bar. She wins the admiration of two other patrons, Higuchi and Hanuki, after punching T\u014dd\u014d when he makes an advance on her. Higuchi and Hanuki lead the ''k\u014dhai'' in [[gate crashing]] strangers' parties, where she drinks an impressive amount of alcohol. She later participates in a drinking game with Rihaku, a supernatural being, and wins.\n\nMeanwhile, the ''senpai'' undertakes a number of adventures to find a copy of ''Ratatatam'', a beloved book from the ''k\u014dhai'''s childhood. After obtaining the book, he learns that she is to play the lead in the final scene of a [[guerilla theatre]] production. He attempts to replace the male lead in the scene, but is unsuccessful. Having caught a cold, the ''senpai'' returns home.\n\nThe ''k\u014dhai'' visits the companions she has met throughout the night, all of whom have caught the same cold as the ''senpai'', and nurses them back to health. Her final visit is to the ''senpai'', who gives her the copy of ''Ratatatam'' and suggests visiting a used bookstore together, to which she enthusiastically assents. The film ends with the two meeting for coffee before going to the bookstore.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Characters\n!
