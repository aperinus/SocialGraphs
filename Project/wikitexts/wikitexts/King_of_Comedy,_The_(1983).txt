It is the first production of Embassy International Pictures, later [[Regency Enterprises]], and is also Jerry Lewis's final film for 20th Century Fox.\n\n== Plot ==\nRupert Pupkin is a delusional and aspiring stand-up comedian trying to launch his career. After meeting Jerry Langford, a successful comedian and talk-show host, Rupert believes his \"big break\" has finally come. He attempts to book a spot on Langford's show, but is continually rebuffed by his staff, particularly Cathy Long, and finally by Langford himself. Along the way, Rupert indulges in elaborate and obsessive fantasies in which he and Langford are colleagues and friends.\n\nHoping to impress, Rupert invites a date, Rita, to accompany him when he arrives uninvited at Langford's country home. When Langford returns home to find Rupert and Rita settling in, he angrily tells them to leave. Rupert continues brushing off Jerry's dismissals and Rita's urging until Jerry finally retorts that he had only told Rupert he could call him so Jerry would get rid of him. Bitterly vowing to work \"50 times harder\", Rupert finally leaves.\n\nExhausted with rejection, Rupert hatches a kidnapping plot with the help of Masha, a fellow stalker similarly obsessed with Langford. As ransom, Rupert demands that he be given the opening spot on that evening's episode of Langford's show (guest hosted by [[Tony Randall]]) and that the show be broadcast in normal fashion. The network's bosses, lawyers and the FBI agree to his demands, with the understanding that Langford will be released once the show airs. Between the taping of the show and the broadcast, Masha has her \"dream date\" with Langford, who is taped to a chair in her parents' Manhattan townhouse. Langford convinces her to untie him under the guise of seduction, at which time he seizes the gun, only to find it is a toy gun loaded with faulty pellets. He slaps Masha to subdue her and flees downtown, where he angrily sees Rupert's full stand-up routine on a series of television display sets.\n\nMeanwhile, Rupert's act is well received by the studio audience. In his act, he describes his troubled upbringing while simultaneously laughing at his circumstances. Rupert then closes his act by confessing to the audience that he kidnapped Langford to break into show business. As the audience still laughs (thinking it's still a part of his act), Rupert responds by saying: \"Tomorrow, you'll know I wasn't kidding and you'll all think I'm crazy. But I figure it this way: better to be king for a night than a [[Schmuck (pejorative)|schmuck]] for a lifetime.\" Having shown the broadcast to Rita at her bar, he proudly submits to his arrest as the FBI agents profess distaste for his jokes.\n\nThe film ends with a news report of Rupert's crime, his six-year prison sentence and parole after two years, set to a montage of storefronts stocking his \"long-awaited\" autobiography, ''King for a Night'', which states that Rupert still considers Langford his friend and mentor and that he is currently weighing several \"attractive offers,\" including comedy tours and a film adaptation of his memoirs. Rupert later takes the stage for a television special with a live audience, where an announcer enthusiastically introduces him as the King of Comedy while Rupert himself prepares to address his audience. The announcer repeats \"Ladies and gentlemen, Rupert Pupkin\", or a variation of this, seven times.\n\n== Cast ==\n=== Principal cast ===\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Rupert Pupkin, a struggling [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] with [[Mental disorder|mental health]] issues who longs to appear on Langford's show.

De Niro was not interested and preferred their next collaboration to be a comedy. He had purchased the rights of a script by film critic [[Paul D. Zimmerman]].<ref name=\"Baxter pp.219/20\">Baxter, John ''De Niro A Biography'' pp.&nbsp;219/20.</ref> [[Michael Cimino]] was first proposed as director but eventually withdrew from the project because of the extended production of ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grist |first1=Leighton |title=The Films of Martin Scorsese, 1978\u201399: Authorship and Context II |date=2013 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Basingstoke, UK |isbn=978-1-4039-2035-5 |page=69}}</ref>\n\n[[Bob Fosse]] briefly considered directing the film and suggested [[Andy Kaufman]] as Rupert Pupkin, Sandra Bernhard as Masha and [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] as Jerry Langford. Ultimately, Fosse passed on the film in favor of directing ''[[Star 80]]'' instead. Scorsese pondered whether he could face shooting another film, particularly with a looming strike by the [[Writers Guild of America]]. Producer [[Arnon Milchan]] knew he could do the project away from Hollywood interference by filming entirely on location in New York and deliver it on time with the involvement of a smaller film company.<ref name=\"Baxter pp.219/20\" />\n\nAfter such a strong critical appreciation for the way in which Scorsese had shot ''Raging Bull'', the director felt that ''The King of Comedy'' needed more of a raw cinematic style, one of which would take its cues from early silent cinema, using more static camera shots, and fewer dramatic close-ups. Scorsese has noted that Edwin S. Porter's 1903 film ''[[Life of an American Fireman]]'' had greatly influenced ''The King of Comedy''<nowiki/>'s visual style.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last1=Thompson |editor-first1=David Thompson |title=Scorsese on Scorsese |date=1991 |publisher=Faber and Faber |location=London u.a. |isbn=0-571-15243-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/scorseseonscorse0000scor_q9s3/page/88 88] |edition=Repr. |url=https://archive.org/details/scorseseonscorse0000scor_q9s3/page/88}}</ref>\n\nDe Niro prepared for Rupert Pupkin's role by developing a \"role reversal\" technique, consisting of chasing down his own autograph-hunters, stalking them and asking them many questions. As Scorsese remembered, he even agreed to meet and talk with one of his longtime stalkers:<blockquote>The guy was waiting for him with his wife, a shy suburban woman who was rather embarrassed by the situation. He wanted to take him to dinner at their house, a two-hour drive from New York. After he had persuaded him to stay in Manhattan, [De Niro] asked him, 'Why are you stalking me? What do you want?' He replied, 'To have dinner with you, have a drink, chat. My mom asked me to say hi.'<ref>{{Cite book |title=De Niro: A Life |last=Levy |first=Shawn |publisher=Crown Archetype |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-307-71678-1 |location=New York }}</ref></blockquote>De Niro also spent months watching stand-up comedians at work to get the rhythm and timing of their performances right. Fully in phase with his character, he went as far as declining an invitation to dinner from Lewis because he was \"supposed to be at his throat and ready to kill him for [his] chance\".<ref>{{Cite book |title=Untouchable: Robert De Niro: Unauthorised |last=Dougan |first=Andy |publisher=Random House |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-7535-0407-9 |location=London |page={{page needed |date=March 2018}}}}</ref>\n\nIn the biography/overview of his work, ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', the director had high praise for Jerry Lewis, stating that during their first conversation before shooting, Lewis was extremely professional and assured him before shooting that there would be no ego clashes or difficulties. Scorsese said he felt Lewis' performance in the film was vastly underrated and deserved more acclaim.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last1=Thompson |editor-first1=David Thompson |title=Scorsese on Scorsese |date=1991 |publisher=Faber and Faber |location=London u.a. |isbn=0-571-15243-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/scorseseonscorse0000scor_q9s3/page/90 90] |edition=Repr. |url=https://archive.org/details/scorseseonscorse0000scor_q9s3/page/90}}</ref>\nAccording to an interview with Lewis in the February 7, 1983, edition of ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine, he claimed that Scorsese and De Niro employed [[method acting]] tricks, including making a slew of [[anti-Semitic]] epithets during the filming to \"pump up Lewis's anger\".<ref>''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', February 7, 1983, page 44.</ref> Lewis described making the film as a pleasurable experience and noted that he got along well with both Scorsese and De Niro. Lewis said he was invited to collaborate on certain aspects of the script dealing with celebrity life. He suggested an ending in which Rupert Pupkin kills Jerry, but was turned down. As a result, Lewis thought that the film, while good, did not have a \"finish\".<ref name=\"Bogdanovich p196\">Bogdanovich, Peter. ''Who The Hell's In It'', p.196.</ref>\n\nIn an interview for the DVD, Scorsese stated that Jerry Lewis suggested that the brief scene where Jerry Langford is accosted by an old lady for autographs, who screams, \"You should only get cancer\", when Lewis politely rebuffs her, was based on a real-life incident that happened to Lewis. Scorsese said Lewis directed the actress playing the old lady to get the timing right.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n=== Writing ===\nAt the time he wrote his script, [[Paul D.
