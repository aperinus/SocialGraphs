Macy]], [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Julia Stiles]], [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], [[Rebecca Pidgeon]], [[David Paymer]], [[Patti LuPone]], [[Clark Gregg]], and [[Charles Durning]].\n\nThe plot involves the on-location production in [[Waterford, Vermont]], of a film called ''The Old Mill''. The actual film was shot in Massachusetts in [[Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts|Manchester-by-the-Sea]], [[Beverly, Massachusetts|Beverly]], [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]] and [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]].\n\n''State and Main'' received favorable reviews from critics.\n\n== Plot ==\nHavoc is wrought on the inhabitants of a small New England town by a troubled film production. After the leading man's [[ephebophilia|penchant for underage girls]] gets them banished from their [[New Hampshire]] location, the crew moves to the small town of [[Waterford, Vermont]] to finish shooting ''The Old Mill''.\n\nAs its title suggests, the film depends on the presence of a genuine mill, something the town is reported to possess. Unfortunately, with only days before principal photography begins, it becomes apparent that the mill in fact burned down decades ago.\n\nUnfazed, the film's director, Walt Price ([[William H. Macy]]), places his faith in the ability of first-time screenwriter Joseph Turner White ([[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]) to alter the script. What he doesn't count on is White's apparently bottomless reserve of angst-fueled writer's block. A local bookseller, Annie Black ([[Rebecca Pidgeon]]), tries to provide White with inspiration.\n\nThe film's leading lady ([[Sarah Jessica Parker]]) refuses to do her contracted nude scene unless she's paid an additional $800,000, while the foreign cinematographer offends the locals by messing with a historic firehouse. Meanwhile, the leading man, Bob Barrenger ([[Alec Baldwin]]), dallies with Carla ([[Julia Stiles]]), a crafty local teen.\n\nEverything comes to a head after Barrenger and Carla are injured in a car accident, which leads White (the only witness) to another emotional quandary and into the arms of Annie.  Meanwhile, a powerful movie producer ([[David Paymer]]) comes to town to help Price with the ensuing mess.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[William H.
