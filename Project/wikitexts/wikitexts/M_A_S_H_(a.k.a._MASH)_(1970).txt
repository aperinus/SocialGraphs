The picture is the only theatrically released [[feature film]] in the ''[[M*A*S*H]]'' franchise, and it became one of the biggest films of the early 1970s for [[20th Century Fox]].\n\nThe film depicts a unit of medical personnel stationed at a [[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]] (MASH) during the [[Korean War]].

They are insubordinate, womanizing, mischievous rule-breakers, but they soon prove to be excellent combat surgeons. Other characters already stationed at the camp include bumbling commanding officer [[List of M*A*S*H characters#Henry Blake|Henry Blake]], his hyper-competent chief clerk [[Radar O'Reilly]], dentist Walter \"Painless Pole\" Waldowski, the incompetent and pompous surgeon [[Frank Burns]], and the contemplative Chaplain [[Father Mulcahy]].\n\nThe main characters in the camp divide into two factions. Irritated by Frank's religious fervor, Hawkeye and Duke get Blake to move him to another tent so newly arrived chest surgeon [[Trapper John McIntyre]] can move in. The three doctors (the \"Swampmen\", after the nickname for their tent) have little respect for military protocol, having been drafted into the Army, and are prone to pranks, womanizing, and heavy drinking. Frank is a straitlaced military officer who wants everything done efficiently and by the book, as is [[Margaret Houlihan]]<!--do not change to O'Houlihan; see Talk Page and help reach a consensus-->, who has been assigned to the 4077th as head nurse. The two bond over their respect for regulations and start a secret romance. With help from Radar, the Swampmen sneak a microphone into a tent where the couple are making love and broadcast their passion over the camp's PA system, embarrassing them badly and earning Houlihan the nickname \"Hot Lips.\" The next morning, Hawkeye goads Frank into assaulting him, resulting in the latter's removal from the camp for psychiatric evaluation. Later, when Hot Lips is showering, the Swampmen prank her by pulling the tent sides off and exposing her naked body, in order to settle a bet over whether or not she is a natural blonde. Furious and embarrassed, Hot Lips screams at Blake for letting his staff run wild and failing to discipline them.\n\nPainless, described as \"the best-equipped dentist in the Army\" and \"the dental Don Juan of Detroit\", becomes depressed over an incident of [[erectile dysfunction|impotence]] and announces his intent to commit suicide, believing that he has turned homosexual. The Swampmen agree to help him carry out the deed, staging a feast to evoke [[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper]], arranging for [[Father Mulcahy]] to give Painless absolution and communion, and providing him with a \"black capsule\" (actually a sleeping pill) to speed him on his way. Hawkeye persuades the gorgeous Lieutenant \"Dish\" Schneider\u2014who has remained faithful to her husband and is being transferred back to the United States for discharge\u2014to spend the night with Painless and allay his concern about his \"[[latent homosexuality]]\". The next morning, Painless is his usual cheerful self, and a smiling Dish leaves camp in a helicopter to start her journey home.\n\nTrapper and Hawkeye are sent to Japan on temporary duty to operate on a Congressman's son and hopefully, play some golf. When they later perform an unauthorized operation on a local infant, they face disciplinary action from the hospital commander for misusing Army resources. Using staged photographs of him in bed with a prostitute, they [[blackmail]] him into keeping his mouth shut.\n\nFollowing their return to camp, Blake and General Hammond organize a [[American Football|football]] game between the 4077th and the 325th Evac Hospital and wager several thousand dollars on its outcome. At Hawkeye's suggestion, Blake applies to have a specific [[neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] \u2013 [[Spearchucker Jones|Dr. Oliver Harmon \"Spearchucker\" Jones]], a former professional football player for the [[San Francisco 49ers]] \u2013 transferred to the 4077th as a [[List of sports idioms#R|ringer]]. Hawkeye also suggests that Blake bet half his money up front and keep Jones out of the first half of the game. The 325th scores repeatedly and easily, even after the 4077th drugs one of their star players to incapacitate him. Hammond confidently offers high odds, against which Blake bets the rest of his money. Jones enters the second half, which quickly devolves into a free-for-all, and the 4077th gets the 325th's second ringer thrown out of the game and wins with a final trick play.\n\nNot long after the football game, Hawkeye and Duke get their discharge orders and begin their journey home \u2013 taking the same stolen Jeep in which they arrived.<ref>{{Citation |title=MASH (1970) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066026/plotsummary |access-date=2019-01-14 |archive-date=2017-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307195824/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066026/plotsummary |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as [[Hawkeye Pierce|Capt.

In the [[DVD]] [[audio commentary]], Altman describes the novel as \"pretty terrible\" and somewhat \"racist\" (the only major black character has the nickname \"Spearchucker\"). He claims that the screenplay was used only as a springboard.<ref name=DVDcommentary /> Despite this assertion by Altman, however, while some improvisation occurs in the film and Altman changed the order of major sequence, most sequences are in the novel. The main deletion is a subplot of Ho-Jon's return to the 4077th as a casualty (when Radar steals blood from Henry, it is for Ho-Jon's operation under Trapper and Hawkeye's scalpels; when the surgeons are playing poker after the football game, they are resolutely ignoring Ho-Jon's corpse being driven away).{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} The main deviation from the script is the trimming of much of the dialogue.\n\nIn his director's commentary, Altman says that ''M*A*S*H'' was the first major studio film to use the word \"[[fuck]]\" in its dialogue.<ref name=DVDcommentary>Altman, Robert ''M*A*S*H Collector's Edition'' (Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment), \"Director's Commentary\" track.
