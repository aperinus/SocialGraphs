It stars [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] as [[Perry Edward Smith|Perry Smith]] and [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]] as [[Richard Hickock|Richard \"Dick\" Hickock]], two men who murder a family of four in [[Holcomb, Kansas]]. Although the film is in parts faithful to the book, Brooks made some slight alterations, including the inclusion of a fictional character, \"The Reporter\" (played by [[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]]).\n\nThe film was shot [[location shooting|on location]] at sites where Smith and Hickock's crimes occurred, including the real Clutter home where they robbed and murdered all four members of the family. The film was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. In 2008, it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cinematic Classics, Legendary Stars, Comedic Legends and Novice Filmmakers Showcase the 2008 Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-08-237/2008-entries-to-national-film-registry-announced/2008-12-30/|access-date=2020-11-16|website=Library of Congress}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-11-16|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nTold through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], ex-convicts [[Perry Smith (murderer)|Perry Smith]] and [[Richard Hickock|\"Dick\" Hickock]] meet in rural Kansas in the fall of 1959. Together, they concoct a plan to invade the farm home of the wealthy Clutter family, as patriarch Herbert Clutter supposedly keeps a large supply of cash in a wall safe. The two criminals break into the home in the middle of the night but are unable to find any safe, as Herbert uses checks for his personal business and his farm operations. In order to leave no witnesses to their robbery attempt, Smith and Hickock kill Herbert by cutting his throat, and proceed to murder his wife, Bonnie, and their two teenage children, Nancy, 16, and Kenyon, 14, with a [[shotgun]]. Their bodies are discovered the next day, and a Finney County sheriff's and Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KBI) investigation is immediately launched, headed by detective [[Alvin Dewey]].\n\nBased on a tip by a former cell mate of Hickock, the two men become the primary suspects for the Clutter murders. The fugitives elude law enforcement by heading to [[Florida]], traveling southwest across the country, and eventually crossing the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border. After two weeks in Mexico, the two return to the United States, and decide to travel to [[Las Vegas|Las Vegas, Nevada]], hoping to earn money in gambling winnings. Shortly after their arrival to Las Vegas, Smith and Hickock are arrested for driving a stolen car, violating parole, and passing bad checks.\n\nThe [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department|Las Vegas Police Department]] and the KBI later separately interrogate the two men about the Clutter murders. Both Smith and Hickock admit to passing bad checks, but both deny knowing anything about the murders. The KBI attempts to scare the men into confessing, claiming that they left a witness behind who can testify against them. The KBI interrogation, however, is slowed by Smith's refusal to provide answers. Next, the KBI confront the two with evidence, such as a bloody footprint matching the boots worn by Smith. Finally, Hickock relents, confessing that he was present, but that Smith carried out the murders. He begs for immunity from the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]]. After Smith learns that Hickock has confessed, he recounts how, it was in fact he, not Hickock, who wielded the knife and pulled the trigger in all four killings, but maintains that Hickock was present as an active accomplice.\n\nBoth Smith and Hickock are charged with [[first-degree murder]], found guilty on all counts, and each sentenced to death by [[hanging]]. After losing multiple appeals both men are hanged for their crimes with law enforcement officials and media representatives in attendance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n*[[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] as [[Perry Smith (murder)|Perry Smith]]\n*[[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]] as [[Dick Hickock]]\n*[[John Forsythe]] as [[Alvin Dewey]]\n*[[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]] as Jensen, the reporter\n*[[Gerald S.

In rehearsals, cinematographer [[Conrad Hall]] noticed that the rain sliding down the glass was casting shadows on Blake's face, creating a visual effect that made it appear that Blake was crying. Hall pointed it out to Brooks and the blocking for Blake's character was changed so that the 'tears' would stay on his face throughout the scene. Hall, who was nominated for an Academy Award for his work on the film, called this effect \"purely a visual accident\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Conrad Hall interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mas4zNdBhzo  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/mas4zNdBhzo |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|website=YouTube |access-date=15 January 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n===Musical score===\n{{Main|In Cold Blood (soundtrack)}}\nThe score for the film was composed by Quincy Jones, who at the time had little experience with film scores.{{sfn|Daniel|2011|p=181}} During the period, few black musicians were hired to compose scores for feature films, and Columbia Pictures initially pressed for [[Leonard Bernstein]] to compose the score, but Brooks insisted on Jones.{{sfn|Daniel|2011|p=181}}\n\nIn preparing the score, Jones accompanied Brooks on a visit to the penitentiary in which Smith and Hickock were confined, and was inspired to utilize two acoustic [[bass guitar|basses]] throughout the score to represent the two killers' \"demented minds\".{{sfn|Daniel|2011|p=181}} The score was completed throughout the shoot, with Jones writing new music to accompany [[dailies]].{{sfn|Daniel|2011|p=181}}\n\n==Personnel==\n* Orchestra [[arrangement|arranged]] and conducted by Quincy Jones\n**[[Gil Bernal]] \u2212 vocals (track 10)\n**[[Buddy Childers]] \u2212 [[trumpet]]<ref name=\"In Cold Blood\">{{cite web |title=In Cold Blood |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/jots.200016342/ |website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n**[[Frank Rosolino]] \u2212 [[trombone]]<ref name=\"In Cold Blood\"/>\n**[[Dave Grusin]] \u2212 [[clavinet]]<ref name=\"In Cold Blood\"/>\n** Gene Cipriano, [[Bud Shank]], William Green \u2212 [[woodwinds]]<ref name=\"In Cold Blood\"/>\n**[[Howard Roberts]] \u2212 [[guitar]]<ref name=\"In Cold Blood\"/>\n**[[Ray Brown (musician)|Ray Brown]], [[Andy Simpkins]] \u2212 [[bass (instrument)|bass]]\n**[[Carol Kaye]] \u2212 [[electric bass]]<ref name=\"In Cold Blood\"/>\n**[[Shelly Manne]], [[Earl Palmer]] \u2212 [[drums]]<ref name=\"In Cold Blood\"/>\n**[[Don Elliott]], [[Emil Richards]] \u2212 [[percussion]]<ref name=\"In Cold Blood\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''In Cold Blood'' premiered in the United States on December{{nbsp}}14, 1967,<ref name=afi/> and grossed approximately $13{{nbsp}}million domestically.<ref name=numbers/> The film earned an additional $7,551 during a limited revival run in the United Kingdom in 2015.<ref name=numbers/>\n\nAt the time of its release, it was rated \"For Mature Audiences\", which meant no children under 17 were allowed to see the film without parents or legal guardians of age; now the MPAA has rated the film \"R\", due to its violence and mature nature.\n\n===Critical response===\n[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film an \"excellent quasidocumentary, which sends shivers down the spine while moving the viewer to ponder\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |author-link=Bosley Crowther |date=December 15, 1967 |title=Screen: Graphic Quadruple Murder |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=59}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, writing, \"At times one feels this is not a movie but a documentary where the events are taking place now.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |date=2007 |title=Roger Ebert's Four Star Reviews--1967-2007 |location=Kansas City |publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing |page=352 |isbn=9780740792175 }}</ref> [[Charles Champlin]] of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' put it on his list of the ten best films of 1967, calling it \"an honest, sobering, revealing motion picture, earnest and authentic, with only minor lapses into theatricality.
