It is the fifth film version of the story of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|mutiny on the ''Bounty'']]. The supporting cast features [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], [[Liam Neeson]] and [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]].\n\nThe screenplay by [[Robert Bolt]] was based on the book ''Captain Bligh and Mr Christian'' (1972) by [[Richard Hough]]. The film was made by [[Dino De Laurentiis Productions]] and Bounty Productions Ltd. and distributed by [[Orion Pictures Corporation]] and [[Thorn EMI|Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment]]. The music score was composed by [[Vangelis]] and the cinematography designed by [[Arthur Ibbetson]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is set as flashbacks from the court martial at Portsmouth<ref>Hough, Richard (1972). Captain Bligh and Mr Christian: The Men and the Mutiny. London: Hutchinsons. {{ISBN|978-0-09-112860-9}}. p. 276.</ref> of Commanding Lieutenant [[William Bligh]] for the loss of {{HMS|Bounty}} to mutineers, led by his friend [[Fletcher Christian]], during its expedition to [[Tahiti]] to gather [[breadfruit]] pods for transplantation in the Caribbean.\n\nBligh sets out from Great Britain in December 1787, electing to sail the ''Bounty'' west round the tip of South America in an attempt to use the expedition to fulfill an ambition to [[circumnavigate]] the globe. The attempt to round [[Cape Horn]] fails due to harsh weather, and the ship is obliged to take the longer eastern route. Finally arriving in Tahiti in October 1788, Bligh finds that due to the delays, the wind is against them for a quick return journey and they must stay on the island for four months longer than planned.\n\nDuring their stay in Tahiti, ship discipline becomes problematic. Many of the crew develop a taste for the easy pleasures that island life offers, especially the native women, making the relationship with their Captain tense. Bligh, at the same time, subjects the crew to pressure, eventually reaching breaking point when some members become intent on staying on the island. When the ship leaves [[Tahiti]], Fletcher is forced to leave his native wife, [[Mauatua]], behind.\n\nThe resumption of naval discipline on the return voyage turns Bligh into a tyrant not willing to tolerate any disobedience whatsoever, creating an atmosphere of tension and violence. Bligh insists that the ship is dirty and orders the crew to clean up several times a day. Many of the men, including Christian, are singled out for tongue-lashings by Bligh.\n\nPlaying on Christian's resentment against Bligh's treatment of both him and the men, the more militant members of the crew finally persuade Christian to take control of the ship. Bligh is roused from his bed and arrested, along with those considered loyal to him, and they are forced into a ship's boat, minimally supplied, and cast adrift. The film follows both the efforts of Fletcher Christian to get his men beyond the reach of British punishment and the epic voyage of Bligh to get his loyalists safely to the [[Dutch East Indies]] in a [[longboat]].\n\nBligh, through courage and excellent seamanship, and a return of his good character and leadership qualities, successfully manages to reach civilisation after a very harrowing journey without navigational charts or firearms. One man, however, is killed by natives as the crew stop for supplies on a hostile island. Bligh is portrayed as a man who, on the one hand takes his sense of discipline and command too far, exceeding the limits of the ship's company, but whose character ultimately successfully protects his loyal non-mutineers and guides their overcrowded boat to safety.\n\nThe mutineers sail back to Tahiti to collect their wives, girlfriends and native friends. [[P\u014dmare I|King Tynah]], however, is concerned that their presence on the island could incite King George to declare war against Tahiti and his people. Realising the folly of staying, the mutineers gather supplies and sail away to try to find a safe refuge. Christian pleads with Tynah to allow Mauatua to decide her own destiny. Tynah concedes, and Mauatua chooses the uncertainty of a life with Christian over remaining with her father.\n\nThe search for a safe haven is long and seemingly impossible, as they realise that any pursuing Royal Navy vessels will search all known islands and coastlines to find them. At this point, those who remained on board the ''Bounty'' are so frustrated that they are ready to rebel against Christian to turn the ship back towards Tahiti. After Christian forces the crew to continue on, they eventually find [[Pitcairn Island]], a place which Christian realises is not marked on British maps of the region.\n\nAs the crew of the ''Bounty'' burn the ship to keep it from being found (as well as to motivate the crew to tough it out on the island), the judgment of Bligh's [[court-martial]] is read: Bligh is found not to have been responsible for the loss of the ''Bounty'', and is commended for the voyage of the open boat. Meanwhile, Fletcher Christian and his men realise that they will never go back home to Britain.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}<!-- Cast is in credits order and named as credited; please do not change. -->\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Master's Mate [[Fletcher Christian]]\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Lieutenant [[William Bligh]]\n* [[Laurence Olivier]] as [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Admiral Hood]]\n* [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] as Captain Greetham\n* [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as Sailing Master [[John Fryer (Royal Navy officer)|John Fryer]]\n* [[Bernard Hill]] as William Cole\n* [[Philip Davis (actor)|Phil Davis]] as [[Ned Young|Edward Young]] (as Philip Davis)\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as Seaman Charles Churchill\n* [[Wi Kuki Kaa]] as King Tynah\n* Tevaite Vernette as [[Mauatua]]\n* [[Philip Martin Brown]] as Seaman [[John Adams (mutineer)|John Adams]]\n* [[Simon Chandler]] as [[David Nelson (botanical collector)|David Nelson]]\n* [[Malcolm Terris]] as Dr. John Huggan\n* [[John Sessions]] as John Smith\n* [[Andrew Wilde (actor)|Andrew Wilde]] as Seaman [[William McCoy (mutineer)|William McCoy]]\n* [[Neil Morrissey]] as Seaman [[Matthew Quintal]]\n* [[Richard Graham (actor)|Richard Graham]] as John Mills\n* [[Dexter Fletcher]] as Seaman [[Thomas Ellison (mutineer)|Thomas Ellison]]\n* [[Pete Lee-Wilson]] as William Purcell\n* [[Jon Gadsby]] as John Norton\n* [[Barry Dransfield]] as [[Michael Byrne (sailor)|Michael Byrne]]\n* Steve Fletcher as Seaman James Valentine\n* [[Jack May]] as Prosecuting Captain\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development ===\n====David Lean====\nThis version was originally a longstanding project of director [[David Lean]] and his frequent collaborator, [[Robert Bolt]]. They started working on a script in Bora Bora in October 1977.\n\nLean and Bolt decided to make two films. One named ''The Lawbreakers'' that dealt with the voyage out to Tahiti and the subsequent mutiny, and the second which was to have been named ''The Long Arm'', a study of the journey and the mutineers after the mutiny, as well as the admiralty's response in sending out the frigate {{HMS|Pandora|1779|6}}.<ref name=\"mann\"/>\n\nIn November 1977 producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] announced he would finance the project and make it after his version of the ''[[Hurricane (1979 film)|Hurricane]]''.<ref name=\"clips\">{{cite news|title=FILM CLIPS: The Man Behind the Kangaroo|author=Kilday, Gregg|work=Los Angeles Times|date=Nov 30, 1977|page=g12}}</ref> Phil Kellogg was to produce the films.<ref name=\"clips\"/> In December of that year, Paramount announced they would finance and distribute.<ref>{{cite news|title=FILM CLIPS: Gere, Berenson: Up From Nasty|author=Kilday, Gregg|work=Los Angeles Times|date=Dec 12, 1977|page=f16}}</ref>\n\nThe intention was to shoot the film in Tahiti, where De Laurentiis had built a large facility for shooting ''Hurricane'', including a brand-new hotel.<ref>{{cite news|title='The Hurricane' Builds\u2014in Cost|author=ALJEAN HARMETZ|work=New York Times|date=1 June 1978|page=C15}}</ref>\n\nWhile working on the script, Lean directed a documentary, ''[[Lost and Found: The Story of Cook's Anchor]]'', about discovering an anchor that belonged to a ship of Captain Cook.\n\nIn August 1978 Lean said he expected each film to cost $25 million. \"With the high brow critics you're as good as dead if you spend that sort of money on a film\", he said. \"For that kind of money, the argument runs, anyone should be able to make a good picture.

A script was finished by November 1978. Bernard Williams became attached as producer. He says Lean and De Laurentiis assumed both films could be made for $40 million in total, but Williams budgeted ''The Lawbreakers'' alone at $40 million.<ref name=\"mann\"/> De Laurentiis decided he could not afford to proceed. \"Dino is no longer behind the project\", said Kellogg in November, adding \"The first script is finished and the second is underway.

The latter was the first New Zealand film to obtain a distributor in the US. Donaldson said he met with de Laurentiis to discuss filming a sequel to ''Conan the Barbarian''. Donaldson worked on a new script for that film. \"Some time during that period I mentioned that I thought The Bounty sounded like an interesting project\", Donaldson said. \"Well, when I finished with the Conan script, he didn't really like it so I figured, well, I'm finished with Dino.\"<ref name=\"phil\"/>\n\nThe producer then offered him ''The Bounty'' despite not having seen any of the director's films and the fact that his biggest budget to date had been $1 million.<ref name=\"los\">{{cite news|title=MOVIES: DIRECTOR ROGER DONALDSON: NEW MASTER OF 'THE BOUNTY'|author=Mann, Roderick|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 6, 1984|page=r22}}</ref> (De Laurentiis later says he gave Donaldson the job on the basis of ''Smash Palace''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mogul on the Bounty|author=de Laurentiis, Dino|work=The Guardian|date=May 12, 1984|page=8}}</ref>)\n\n\"Making the movie was something that, initially, I wasn't sure I wanted to do\", said Donaldson. \"I thought it might be perceived as some sort of a remake.

The latter has since gone on to become [[HMS Surprise (novel)|HMS ''Surprise'']] in [[Peter Weir]]'s ''[[Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World|Master and Commander]]''. For the storm sequences a detailed 25-foot model of the ''Bounty'' was built.\n\nGibson described the making of the film as difficult because of the long production time and bad weather: \"I went mad. They would hold their breath at night when I went off. One night I had a fight in a bar and the next day they had to shoot only one side of my face because the other was so messed up. If you see the film, you can see the swelling in certain scenes.\" Anthony Hopkins, who had battled with [[alcoholism]] until becoming [[abstinent]] in 1975, was worried about Gibson's heavy drinking, saying, \"Mel is a wonderful, wonderful fellow with a marvellous future. He's already something of a superstar, but he's in danger of blowing it unless he takes hold of himself.\" Gibson, who likewise self-identified as an alcoholic, agreed with this concern, and added his admiration for the Welsh actor: \"He was terrific. He was good to work with because he was open and he was willing to give. He's a moral man, and you could see this. I think we had the same attitudes.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|title = Mel Gibson: Living Dangerously|author = Joan Goodman|magazine = Playgirl|date=December 1984}}</ref>\n\nDonaldson said Hopkins \"became Bligh\" during filming. \"So much so that you didn't want to sit with him at breakfast.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nDonaldson admits he and Hopkins clashed during filming. \"I'm a bit of a hard task-master\", admitted Donaldson later. \"I won't give up until I really think we've wrung everything we can out of every scene...

According to director Donaldson, <blockquote>\"The major difference between our film and the other versions is that none of the others pointed out that Bligh and Christian were friends. They'd made voyages together before they sailed on the ''Bounty''. And while they were on the ''Bounty'', Bligh demoted another officer and promoted Christian, who was at that stage nothing but a midshipman, and made him second in command. What interested me was to explore how their relationship deteriorated from that point to where Christian leads a mutiny against Bligh.\"<ref name=\"Stephen Farber\"/></blockquote> Unlike earlier versions, this film did not portray Bligh as a villainous character. According to Gibson, \"It was a kind of fresh look at Captain Bligh, and I think of all the renditions of who Bligh was, his was probably the closest. His Bligh was stubborn and didn't suffer fools, but he was brilliant and just had a lot of bad luck.\"<ref name=\"Michael Fleming 2000\">Michael Fleming (July 2000). \"Mel's Movies\", Movieline.</ref>\n''The Bounty'' also paints a far less heroic portrait of Christian. In Gibson's description, \"Fletcher was just a lad of twenty-two and he behaved like one. The first time he decided to test his horns and fight for the herd, it was a mistake. He shouldn't have done it.\" Gibson later expressed the opinion that the film did not go far enough in correcting the historical record.<blockquote>\"I think the main problem with that film was that it tried to be a fresh look at the dynamic of the mutiny situation, but didn't go far enough. In the old version, Captain Bligh was the bad guy and Fletcher Christian was the good guy. But really Fletcher Christian was a social climber and an opportunist. They should have made him the bad guy, which indeed he was. He ended up setting all these people adrift to die, without any real justification. Maybe he'd gone island crazy. They should have painted it that way. But they wanted to exonerate Captain Bligh while still having the dynamic where the guy was mutinying for the good of the crew. It didn't quite work.\"<ref name=\"Michael Fleming 2000\"/></blockquote> The film also portrays the sailors exploiting the islanders. Unlike the earlier film versions, the native women are shown (accurately) totally bare-breasted. Gibson said, \"It was a complete culture shock and it was unbelievable to them. It was paradise in terms of personal freedoms\u2014freedoms that shouldn't have been taken advantage of. They exploited the people, fooled them and didn't tell them the whole truth\".<ref>{{cite news|title = Mel Gibson|author = Terry Poulton|publisher = Close Up|date = Summer 1984}}</ref> Gibson chose to suddenly erupt in violent emotion during the mutiny scene because eyewitness accounts had described Christian as 'extremely agitated' and 'sweating and crying'.<ref>{{cite news|title = Is Mel Gibson Australian or American? |author = Bob Thomas |author-link = Bob Thomas (reporter) |agency = [[Associated Press]]|date = 4 May 1984}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''The Bounty'' grossed $8.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $9.7 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $18.3 million, against a production budget of $20 million.

On the [[Review aggregator|aggregate]] site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] it has received a 74% rating from 19 critical reviews with an average rating of 6.28/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Thanks in large part to its cast, and Anthony Hopkins in particular, ''The Bounty's'' retelling of the mutiny on the HMS Bounty is an intelligent, engaging adventure saga.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1002947-bounty/ |title=Rotten Tomatoes, ''The Bounty''|publisher=Rottentomatoes.com|access-date=2013-04-11}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four stars out of four, stating, \"this ''Bounty'' is not only a wonderful movie, high-spirited and intelligent, but something of a production triumph as well.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19840101/REVIEWS/401010315/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times|title=The Bounty}}</ref>\n\nHowever, others were disappointed with the film, especially given its distinguished cast. Many critics singled out Gibson's performance as bland, particularly when compared to the performances given by [[Clark Gable]] and [[Marlon Brando]] in two earlier adaptations. [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated, \"Both Bligh and Christian are unfinished characters in a screenplay that may or may not have been tampered with... The movie seems to have been planned, written, acted, shot and edited by people who were constantly being over-ruled by other people. It's totally lifeless.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&res=9C05E6D9143AF937A35756C0A962948260&oref=slogin|work=The New York Times|first=Vincent|last=Canby|title='The Bounty,' Capt.

Yet I'd put so much time and effort into the role. So right then and there I decided: Never again. I will no longer invest so much effort in something over which I have no control.
