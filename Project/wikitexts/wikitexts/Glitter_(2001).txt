Carey plays Billie Frank, an aspiring singer who, along with her friends Louise (Da Brat) and Roxanne ([[Tia Texada]]), is a club dancer. Timothy Walker ([[Terrence Howard]]) offers them a contract as backup singers/dancers to another singer. At the premiere of the song they record, Billie meets Julian \"Dice\" Black ([[Max Beesley]]), a nightclub [[DJ]], who helps her in her solo career. In the process, Billie and Dice fall in love.\n\nCarey began working on a film and soundtrack project titled ''All That Glitters'' in 1997. However, during that period, her label [[Columbia Records]] pressured her to release a [[Number 1's (Mariah Carey album)|compilation album]] in time for the holiday season in November 1998. Consequently, Carey put ''All That Glitters'' on hold. Following this, she aimed to complete the film and album project for the summer of 2001. Shooting began in Toronto and New York at the end of September 2000. Carey used the time to work on the soundtrack of the film, along with [[Eric Ben\u00e9t]] and Da Brat, who also appeared in the film.\n\nThe film was released on September 21, 2001, ten days after the release of the [[Glitter (soundtrack)|accompanying soundtrack]] on [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]]. Before its release, Carey was suddenly hospitalized, citing \"extreme exhaustion\" and a \"physical and emotional breakdown\".<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Mariah Carey 'Under Psychiatric Care' |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/mariah-carey-under-psychiatric-care-78905/ |magazine=Billboard |publication-date=August 1, 2001}}</ref> During her hospitalization, Carey was diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 11, 2018 |first=Jess |last=Cagle |title=Mariah Carey: My Battle with Bipolar Disorder |url=https://people.com/music/mariah-carey-bipolar-disorder-diagnosis-exclusive/ |access-date=2022-03-03 |website=PEOPLE.com |language=en}}</ref> Due to this, the film and soundtrack release were both postponed for three weeks.\n\n''Glitter'' was heavily panned by critics and was a [[Box office bomb|box office failure]].

The soundtrack of the film achieved moderate commercial success and went on to sell over two million copies worldwide, considerably less than Carey's previous releases.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 1970s, Lillian Frank is a performer at a nightclub. Lillian tries to rouse the crowd with her torch song, \"Lillie's Blues\", with her daughter Billie Frank accompanying her on vocals. The plot fails and Lillian is fired. Lillian feels defeated and lights a cigarette, but then accidentally falls asleep, starting a fire and causing the building to be evacuated. Due to her mother's actions, Billie is [[Foster care|fostered]].\n\nYears later, in 1983, the adult Billie is a club dancer along with her foster-care friends Louise and Roxanne. They meet Timothy Walker, who offers a contract as backup singers and dancers to the singer Sylk and the three are contracted. Later at a nightclub hosted by Julian \"Dice\" Black, Sylk debuts \"All My Life\". Dice discovers that Billie is the real singer of the song, as a means to cover up Sylk's abysmal singing ability. Impressed, he wishes to produce her but Billie raises concerns about her contract with Timothy and he eventually agrees on the provision that Dice pays him $100,000.\n\nBillie and Dice start working on songs. Ultimately they sign with Guy Richardson of a major record label. With success in their hands, he asks her up to his apartment and they have passionate sex. Billie's first major single, \"[[Loverboy (Mariah Carey song)|Loverboy]]\", is a success. Billie is called to perform at an awards ceremony, where she meets singer Rafael. Billie gets a threat from Timothy concerning the debt that Dice failed to pay. Billie, upset about how Dice lied about her contract and his arrest, argues with and leaves him. Following the break-up, Billie collaborates with several songwriters, including Rafael, with whom she makes another hit single, \"Want You\", and her debut album becomes a massive success.\n\nBillie begins writing a song on her own, due to her emotional pain. Dice also misses Billie, and also begins writing a song. Billie goes to Dice's apartment to reconcile with him but discovers he is not home. She discovers the music he has written and realizes they wrote the same song, \"[[Never Too Far]]\", and kisses his music sheet. Dice, upon seeing her lipstick prints on the sheet, plans a reconciliation but is shot dead by Timothy. Before playing at [[Madison Square Garden]], a devastated Billie sees the news report of Dice's death, and onstage after, commands the band to stop playing \"Loverboy\". She tearfully tells the audience not to take the ones they love for granted, and she then starts to sing \"Never Too Far\". Afterward, Billie reads a note Dice had left her, where he tells her that he loves her and that he has found Lillian. Billie's limo takes her to the secluded rural property where she is happily reunited with her mother.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Mariah Carey]] as Billie Frank\n** Isabel Gomes as young Billie\n* [[Max Beesley]] as Julian \"Dice\" Black\n* [[Terrence Howard]] as Timothy Walker\n* [[Da Brat]] as Louise\n** Lindsey Pickering as young Louise\n* [[Tia Texada]] as Roxanne\n** Courtnie Beceiro as young Roxanne\n* [[Eric Ben\u00e9t]] as Rafael\n* [[Valarie Pettiford]] as Lillian Frank\n* [[Ann Magnuson]] as Kelly\n* [[Dorian Harewood]] as Guy Richardson\n* Grant Nickalls as Jack Bridges\n* [[Padma Lakshmi]] as Sylk\n* Kim Roberts as Miss Wilson\n* [[Bill Sage]] as Mr. Frank\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn late 1997, Carey began work on the project under the working title ''All That Glitters'', but the project was put on hold due to [[Columbia Records]]' requests to release a [[compilation album]] to benefit from the 1998 holiday season.<ref name=\"eonline.com\"/><ref name=\"shapiro6\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=97}}</ref> ''[[Number 1's (Mariah Carey album)|#1's]]'' was released in November 1998.<ref name=\"shapiro6\"/> Despite this, Carey continued working on ''All That Glitters'', but wished to fulfil her contract with Columbia Records, which had her signed for one more album.<ref name=\":0\"/> In 1999, she released her last album with Columbia Records, ''[[Rainbow (Mariah Carey album)|Rainbow]]'', which included some of the material created for ''All That Glitters''.<ref name=\":0\"/> On April 2, 2001, Carey released a joint statement alongside Columbia Records confirming her departure.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite magazine |author=Billboard Staff |date=2001-04-03 |title=Mariah Carey Jumps To Virgin From Columbia |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/mariah-carey-jumps-to-virgin-from-columbia-80193/ |access-date=2022-03-04 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Mariah Carey Leaves Columbia Records |url=https://apnews.com/article/92d8259f9dc93c061ffa21c36ca828e4 |access-date=2022-03-05 |website=AP NEWS |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Saraceno |first=Christina |date=2001-04-03 |title=Mariah Carey Inks Virgin Deal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mariah-carey-inks-virgin-deal-234086/ |access-date=2022-03-05 |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nFollowing this departure, Carey signed a US$100 million record deal with [[Virgin Records]] ([[EMI Records]]) in April 2001.<ref name=\"emi\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1777172.stm|title=EMI Drops Mariah Carey|work=[[BBC News]]|date=January 31, 2002|access-date=February 3, 2011}}</ref> The record label gave Carey full conceptual and creative control over the project.<ref name=\"emi\" /> It was announced that ''All That Glitters'' would take place in 1983, with the sound of its soundtrack following the theme through a modernized version of the 1980s sound.<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|url=https://allmusic.com/album/glitter-r544381|title=((( Glitter > Overview ))) |publisher=[[AllMusic]].
