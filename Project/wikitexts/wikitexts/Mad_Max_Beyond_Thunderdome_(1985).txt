Miller revived the series in 2015 with the release of the fourth installment, ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]'', which stars [[Tom Hardy]] in the title role.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[post-apocalyptic]] Australia, [[Max Rockatansky]] is crossing the desert in a motor vehicle pulled by camels. The airborne bandit Jedediah and his young son attack him and steal his vehicle, and Max follows Jedediah's trail to a trading post called Bartertown. Initially refused entry because he has nothing to trade, he impresses the local officials with his toughness, and the founder and ruler of the town, Aunty Entity, offers to resupply him if he completes a task.\n\nAunty explains that Bartertown's precious energy comes from a subterranean [[Anaerobic digestion|refinery]], called Underworld, that turns pig feces into [[methane]]. The refinery is run by a resourceful [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] called Master, who rides around on Blaster, his giant bodyguard. \"Master Blaster\" has begun to challenge Aunty for control of Bartertown, and she wants Max to kill Blaster so she can more easily subvert Master to her will. \n\nMax inflitrates Underworld to size up Master Blaster and befriends Pig Killer, a convict sentenced to work there for slaughtering a pig to feed his children. When Master Blaster learns his newly-acquired vehicle belonged to Max, he forces Max to disarm a booby-trap. In doing so, Max sets off his alarm and discovers that Blaster is hypersensitive to high-pitched noises.\n\nBack on the surface, Aunty tells Max that, by law, conflicts in Bartertown are resolved by a fight to the death in a [[Gladiator|gladiatorial]] arena called Thunderdome. Max publicly accuses Master of stealing his vehicle, which a mechanic has converted to run on methane, and a battle is scheduled against Blaster. The giant dominates until Max blows a [[bosun's whistle]], which makes Blaster grab his head in pain. Max knocks Blaster's helmet off and prepares to kill him, but relents upon seeing that Blaster has an [[intellectual disability]]. Max reveals Aunty's plot and Master threatens to shut down the refinery, so Aunty has Blaster killed. She is then able to terrorize Master into keeping the refinery running.\n\nFor breaking a deal, Max is bound, placed on a horse, and sent into the Wasteland, his punishment determined by the spin of a wheel. When the horse collapses from exhaustion, Max frees himself and continues on foot until he also collapses.\n\nSavannah Nix finds Max near death and hauls him back to her home, an [[oasis]] populated by a primitive tribe of children and teenagers. The children are descended from survivors of a crashed [[Boeing 747]], some of whom left to seek help and never returned. They believe Max is the pilot, Captain Walker, come to fix the aeroplane and fly them to the fabled \"Tomorrow-morrow Land\". Max denies he is Walker and insists there is no longer any civilisation like that in their stories. Disillusioned, a group of children led by Savannah wants to attempt the journey to Bartertown, but Max stops them and has them tied up, saying everyone should go on living in the oasis.\n\nDuring the night, the separatists escape. Max agrees to bring them back, taking a few children along, but both parties are in bad shape by the time he catches up. Out of supplies, Max is forced to lead the children back to Bartertown.\n\nThe combined group sneaks into Underworld and, with Pig Killer's help, frees Master and escapes in a modified truck down some train tracks, destroying the refinery and most of Bartertown in the process. Aunty orders her forces to pursue and retrieve Master, and Max and his group do their best to fight off the attackers. They come across Jedediah and his son, who Max coerces into providing a ride in their aeroplane. With the approach of Aunty's army shortening the runway, Max gets in his vehicle, which a child stole from one of Aunty's men, and crashes an opening so the plane can take off. Injured and alone, Max is spared by an impressed Aunty, who leaves to rebuild Bartertown.\n\nJedediah flies Master, Pig Killer, and the children to the ruins of [[Sydney]]. Years later, they have established a small community with other wanderers. While they attempt to rediscover the knowledge of the pre-apocalyptic world, each night Savannah recites the story of their journey and they light up the city as a beacon to lead Max, or anyone else still out there, home.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- in the same order and with the same subdivisions as the film's scrolling end credits -->\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as [[Max Rockatansky|\"Mad\" Max Rockatansky]], a lone warrior who was an MFP (Main Force Patrol) officer before the collapse of society.

Despite her brutality and Bartertown's chaos, Aunty is an intelligent, cultured woman, who holds a hope of one day rebuilding society to its former glory. Regarding the character, Miller said: \"We needed someone whose vitality and intelligence would make her control over Bartertown credible.
