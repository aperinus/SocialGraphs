The film grossed $17 million against its $26 million budget, and received mostly negative reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nJake Huard wakes up after being knocked down during a boxing match. After beating his opponent, he returns to the home he shares with his distant father, who is also his employer at a naval shipyard, building vessels for the [[United States Navy|Navy]] and doubts Jake's ability to amount to anything.\n\nHuard is visited by [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Burton, telling Jake that his application to the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland]] has been recently accepted. At a bar where Huard and his friends are celebrating, his friends introduce him to a young woman named Ali, whom they claim is a [[prostitute]] hired as a going-away present. Huard's attempts to seduce Ali are unsuccessful, and his farewell with his father leaves him frustrated.\n\nOn his first day at the Academy, Huard discovers that one of his instructors Ali, a [[Midshipman#United States Navy and Marine Corps|Midshipman 2nd Class]] (an [[student#Post-second year|upperclassman]]), is the same woman that his friends introduced him to. She and her fellow instructor, Whitaker, begin [[hazing]] Huard's class of [[Plebs#United States military academies|plebes]], and that Huard in particular is behind academically. Their [[Company (military unit)|company]] commander, Midshipman Lieutenant Cole, had been an enlisted [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] prior to joining the Academy; announces his intent to run out any midshipman he deems unfit to be an officer.<ref>Gal Perl Finkel, [https://web.archive.org/web/20191114140815/https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/A-new-strategy-against-ISIS-483521 A NEW STRATEGY AGAINST ISIS], [[The Jerusalem Post]], March 7, 2017. Retrieved October 20, 2020.</ref> Huard's roommates include overweight Nance (nicknamed Twins), Loo, and Estrada, who is being singled out by Whitaker because of his ethnicity.\n\nOrdered by Whitaker to take multiple showers per day due to a perceived stench, Estrada one day fails to complete his task but nevertheless reports to Whitaker that the orders were fully executed. Loo informs Cole of Estrada's dishonor, and Estrada is processed out of the Naval Academy. Meanwhile, Huard's class becomes increasingly frustrated from suffering due to his failures, as evidenced by Loo moving out of the room. Nance explains his refusal to leave by noting that the instructors are so focused on Huard that they are leaving him alone. While home on winter leave, Huard intends not to return until he discovers that his father made a wager, expecting Huard to fail. Upon his return, the class begins instruction in [[boxing]], and it is announced that a midshipman tournament; the Brigades, will occur at the end of the year. After Huard angers the boxing instructor with some [[unsportsmanlike conduct]] toward Cole in the ring, he is forced to train by himself.\n\nDuring an after-hours match with Burton, Huard swallows his pride and admits he needs help training; enlisting Ali and Burton for physical training, and Nance to gain enough weight to be in Cole's [[heavyweight|weight class]]. In his match with Loo, he endures some taunting and returns with a single-punch [[knockout]], earning him Loo's respect and support. Huard also begins to excel in his classes, gaining respect with the rest of his class when he proves capable of performing academically. During the tournament, Jake progresses and defeats Whitaker in the semifinals, leaving him and Cole for the final match.\n\nAfter Nance fails by just four seconds to successfully complete the obstacle course, Cole informs Nance that he will be kicked out from the Academy. Nance attempts [[suicide]], prompting Huard to tackle Cole in anger. Expecting to be kicked out as well, Huard begins to pack up and leave, until Cole approaches him and informs him that he has requested more time from the disciplinary board; delaying the hearing until after the final Brigades match. After some encouragement from the recovering Nance, Huard steps into the ring to fight Cole, lasting a full three rounds. Although Cole wins [[Split decision|by decision]], Huard's boxing ability earns him the respect of the entire Academy, as well as his father, who has come to see the fight.\n\nAt his hearing, the disciplinary board decides to retain Huard, based on Cole's recommendation. The Class of 2008 celebrates the end of their Plebe year, while Huard and Ali finally express their mutual attraction openly. Huard approaches newly-[[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] [[Second Lieutenant#United States|Second Lieutenant]] Cole to ask who would have won if the fight had continued, to which Cole challenges Huard to join the Marines to find out.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[James Franco]] as Midshipman 4th Class Jake Huard\n* [[Tyrese Gibson]] as Midshipman 1st Class / 2nd Lieutenant Matthew Cole\n* [[Jordana Brewster]] as Midshipman 2nd Class Alison \"Ali\" Halloway\n* [[Vicellous Reon Shannon]] as \"Twins\" / Marcus Nance\n* [[Roger Fan]] as Loo\n* [[Wilmer Calderon]] as Estrada\n* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as Lieutenant Commander Burton\n* [[Chi McBride]] as McNally\n* [[Brian Goodman]] as Bill Huard\n* Billy Finnigan as Kevin\n* Rocco Rosanio as Jake's Friend\n* [[Jim Parrack]] as A.J.\n* [[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]] as Supt.
