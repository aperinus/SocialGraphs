Directed by [[Sam Raimi]] from a screenplay by [[David Koepp]], it is the first installment in Raimi's [[Spider-Man (2002 film series)|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]], and stars [[Tobey Maguire]] as the [[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|titular character]], alongside [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[James Franco]], [[Cliff Robertson]], and [[Rosemary Harris]]. The film chronicles Spider-Man's [[origin story]] and early superhero career. After being bitten by a genetically-altered spider, outcast teenager Peter Parker develops spider-like superhuman abilities and adopts a masked superhero identity to fight crime and injustice in [[New York City]], facing the sinister [[Norman Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|Green Goblin]] (Dafoe) in the process.\n\nDevelopment on a live-action Spider-Man film began in the 1980s. Filmmakers [[Tobe Hooper]], [[James Cameron]], and [[Joseph Zito]] were all attached to direct the film at one point. However, the project would languish in [[development hell]] due to licensing and financial issues. After progress on the film stalled for nearly 25 years, it was licensed for a worldwide release by [[Columbia Pictures]] in 1999 after it acquired options from [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] on all previous scripts developed by [[The Cannon Group|Cannon Films]], [[Carolco Pictures|Carolco]], and [[New Cannon]]. Exercising its option on just two elements from the multi-script acquisition (a different screenplay was written by James Cameron, Ted Newsom, [[John Brancato]], Barney Cohen, and [[Menahem Golan|Joseph Goldman]]), Sony hired Koepp to create a working screenplay (credited as Cameron's), and Koepp received sole credit in final billing. Directors [[Roland Emmerich]], [[Ang Lee]], [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], [[Barry Sonnenfeld]], [[Tim Burton]], [[Michael Bay]], [[Jan de Bont]], [[M. Night Shyamalan]], [[Tony Scott]], and [[David Fincher]] were considered to direct the project before Raimi was hired as director in 2000. The Koepp script was rewritten by [[Scott Rosenberg]] during pre-production and received a dialogue polish from [[Alvin Sargent]] during production. Filming took place in [[Los Angeles]] and New York City from January to June 2001. [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]] handled the film's [[visual effects]].<ref name=\"imageworks\">{{cite web |title=About |url=https://www.imageworks.com/about |access-date=February 8, 2019 |website=[[Sony Pictures Imageworks]] |publisher=[[Sony Pictures|Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.]] |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204073242/https://www.imageworks.com/about |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n''Spider-Man'' premiered at the [[Mann Village Theater]] on April 29, 2002, and was released in the United States on May 3. The film received positive reviews from audiences and critics who praised Raimi's direction, the performances, visual effects, action sequences, and musical score. It was the first film to reach $100 million in a single weekend as well as the most successful film based on a comic book at the time. With a box office gross of over $825 million worldwide, it was the [[2002 in film#Highest-grossing films|third highest-grossing film of 2002]], the [[List of highest-grossing superhero films|highest-grossing superhero film]] and the sixth [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film overall]] at the time of its release. ''Spider-Man'' is credited for redefining the modern superhero genre, as well as the [[Blockbuster film|summer blockbuster]].<ref>{{cite web |date=May 3, 2017 |title=15 Years Later, Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man' Is Both a Trendsetter and a Throwback |url=https://collider.com/sam-raimi-spider-man-changed-superhero-movies/#poster |website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |access-date=February 21, 2020 |archive-date=January 9, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200109001649/https://collider.com/sam-raimi-spider-man-changed-superhero-movies/#poster |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=May 3, 2014 |title=SPIDER-MAN WEEK: The Spidey trailer that changed the game |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2014/05/03/spider-man-week-the-spidey-trailer-that-changed-the-game/ |access-date=July 15, 2017 |archive-date=July 10, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710164741/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2014/05/03/spider-man-week-the-spidey-trailer-that-changed-the-game/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=June 16, 2017 |title=Looking Back: Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man' is Still Definitive 15 Years Later |url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2017/looking-back-sam-raimis-spider-man-is-still-definitive-15-years-later/ |website=FirstShowing.net |access-date=July 15, 2017 |archive-date=July 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720173416/http://www.firstshowing.net/2017/looking-back-sam-raimis-spider-man-is-still-definitive-15-years-later/ |url-status=live }}</ref> After its success, the film spawned two sequels, ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', released in 2004 and 2007 respectively. Maguire and Dafoe later reprised their roles in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) film ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (2021), which dealt with the concept of the [[Multiverse (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|multiverse]] and linked the Raimi trilogy to the MCU.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nOn a school trip, high school senior [[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|Peter Parker]] visits a [[Columbia University]] genetics laboratory with his best friend [[Harry Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|Harry Osborn]] and his crush [[Mary Jane Watson (Sam Raimi film series)|Mary Jane Watson]]. There, a [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] \"super-spider\" bites him, and he falls ill upon returning home. Meanwhile, Harry's father [[Norman Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|Norman Osborn]], a scientist and the founder and owner of [[Oscorp]], tries to secure an important military contract. He experiments on himself with an unstable performance-enhancing chemical and goes insane, killing his assistant.\n\nThe next day, Peter finds he is no longer near-sighted and has developed spider-like abilities: he can shoot webs out of his wrists and has quick reflexes, superhuman speed and strength, and a heightened ability to sense danger. Brushing off his [[Uncle Ben]]'s advice that \"[[with great power comes great responsibility]]\", Peter considers buying a car to impress Mary Jane. He enters an underground [[wrestling]] event to win the money for it and wins his first match, but the promoter cheats him out of his earnings. When [[Burglar (comics)|a man]] robs the promoter's office, Peter allows him to escape in retaliation. Moments later, he discovers Ben was carjacked and killed. Peter pursues the carjacker, only to realize it was the man he let escape. The carjacker flees but dies after falling out a window. Meanwhile, a crazed Norman interrupts a military experiment by Oscorp's corporate rival Quest Aerospace and kills several people.\n\nUpon graduating, Peter begins using his abilities to fight injustice, donning a spandex costume and the masked persona of [[Spider-Man]]. [[J. Jonah Jameson (film character)|J. Jonah Jameson]], publisher of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' newspaper, hires Peter as a [[freelance]] photographer since he is the only person providing clear images of Spider-Man. Upon discovering that Oscorp's board plans to oust him to sell the company to Quest, Norman assassinates them. Jameson dubs the mysterious, villainous killer the \"[[Green Goblin]].\"\n\nThe Goblin offers Peter a place at his side, but he refuses. They fight, and Peter is wounded. At Thanksgiving dinner, Peter's [[Aunt May]] invites Mary Jane, Harry, and Norman. During the dinner, Norman sees the wound and realizes Peter's identity. Thinking the only way to defeat Peter is to attack those special to him, Norman later attacks May, forcing her to be hospitalized.\n\nHarry, who is dating Mary Jane, sees her holding Peter's hand to comfort him and presumes she has feelings for him. Devastated, Harry tells his father that Peter loves Mary Jane, unknowingly revealing Spider-Man's biggest weakness. Norman holds Mary Jane and a [[Roosevelt Island Tram]] car full of children hostage alongside the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. He forces Peter to choose whom he wants to save and drops them both. Peter saves both Mary Jane and the tram car. Norman then throws him into an abandoned building and brutally beats him. When Norman says how he intends to kill Mary Jane, Peter regains his strength and gains the upper hand. Norman reveals himself to Peter and begs for forgiveness while subtly getting his glider ready to [[impalement|impale]] Peter from behind. Warned by his spider-sense, Peter dodges the attack, and the glider impales Norman instead. Norman tells Peter not to reveal his identity as the Goblin to Harry before dying. Peter takes Norman's body back to the Osborn house just as Harry arrives and, believing Spider-Man to have killed his father, pulls a gun on him, but he escapes.\n\nAt Norman's funeral, Harry swears vengeance toward Spider-Man, whom he deems responsible for his father's death. Mary Jane confesses to Peter that she loves him. Peter, however, feels he must protect her from the unwanted attention of his enemies, so he hides his true feelings and tells Mary Jane that they can only be friends, causing her to be heartbroken. As Peter leaves, he recalls Ben's words and accepts his new responsibility as Spider-Man.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Quote box\n|quote = I felt like I was an outsider.

Raimi had used more traditional special effects in his previous films and learned a lot about using computers during production.<ref name=\"HBO\" /> Raimi worked hard to plan all the sequences of Spider-Man swinging from buildings, which he described as, \"ballet in the sky.\" The complexity of such sequences meant the budget rose from an initially planned $70&nbsp;million to around $100&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"empire\" /> Shots were made more complicated because of the main characters' individual color schemes, so Spider-Man and the Green Goblin had to be shot separately for effects shots: Spider-Man was shot in front of a [[greenscreen]], while the Green Goblin was shot against bluescreen. Shooting them together would have resulted in one character being erased from a shot.<ref name=\"hughes\" />\n\nDykstra said the biggest difficulty of creating Spider-Man was that as the character was masked, it immediately lost a lot of characterization.

Raimi wanted to convey the essence of Spider-Man as being, \"the transition that occurs between him being a young man going through puberty and being a superhero.\" Dykstra said his crew of animators had never reached such a level of sophistication to give subtle hints of still making Spider-Man feel like a human being.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Zonkel |first=Phillip |date=March 20, 2003 |title=Spinning 'Spider-Man's' Visual Effects Web \u2013 Former CSULB Student John Dykstra Is Credited with a Great Deal of Computer-Generated Movie Magic |work=[[Press-Telegram (Long Beach)|Press-Telegram]] |location=Long Beach, California}}</ref> When two studio executives were shown shots of the computer generated character, they believed it was actually Maguire performing stunts.<ref name=\"hughes\" /> In addition, Dykstra's crew had to composite areas of New York City and replaced every car in shots with digital models.
