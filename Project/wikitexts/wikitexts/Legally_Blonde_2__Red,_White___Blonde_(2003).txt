It is a sequel to the 2001 film ''[[Legally Blonde]]'' and the second film in the [[Legally Blonde (franchise)|''Legally Blonde'' series]]. It stars [[Reese Witherspoon]] (who also served as the film's [[executive producer]]) alongside an [[ensemble cast]] featuring [[Sally Field]], [[Regina King]], [[Jennifer Coolidge]], [[Bruce McGill]], [[Dana Ivey]], [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]], [[Bob Newhart]], and [[Luke Wilson]], with Coolidge and Wilson reprising their roles from the first film.\n\nAlthough the story is set in [[Washington, D.C.]], the film was shot in the offices at [[Vivint Arena]] (then the Delta Center), the [[Utah State Capitol]] in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], and the [[Illinois State Capitol]] in [[Springfield, Illinois]]. The supposed \"aerial views\" on Washington buildings were [[scale model]]s built by the crew.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde Production Notes {{!}} 2003 Movie Releases |url=https://madeinatlantis.com/movies_central/2003/legally-blonde-2-red-white-blonde.htm |access-date=2022-07-12 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe film opened on July 2, 2003, to generally negative reviews from critics. Nevertheless, it was a box office success, grossing $125 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter the events of ''[[Legally Blonde]]'', [[Elle Woods]] wants her [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]], Bruiser, to reunite with his mother, hoping both dogs will attend her wedding to her fianc\u00e9 Emmett. Elle hires a detective to find Bruiser's mother, only to discover that her owner is C'est Magnifique, a [[cosmetics]] company that [[Testing cosmetics on animals|uses Bruiser's mother for testing]]. She finds out that her law firm represents the corporation and when she urges the firm to drop them as a client, she is fired.\n\nElle decides to leave [[Boston]], where she and Bruiser have settled with Emmett, and go to [[Washington, D.C.]], to work on Bruiser's Bill. Elle decides to take it upon herself to be the \"voice for those who can't speak\" and to outlaw animal testing. While working for Congresswoman Victoria Rudd, Elle is met with skepticism and other barriers common to Washington politics. Rudd's member of staff, Timothy, sarcastically calls her \"[[Capitol Hill|Capitol]] [[Barbie]]\". After a variety of ups and downs including a failed attempt to improve her work environment by having her co-workers write compliments about one another and place them in the \"snap cup\", Elle starts to lose her faith in Washington politics.\n\nElle discovers that Bruiser is [[Homosexual behavior in animals|gay]], after she is paged by \"The Paws That Refreshes: A Doggy Day Spa\". He has been affectionate with Leslie, a [[Rottweiller]] owned by Congressman Stan Marks, the Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Committee on Energy and Commerce]] which has jurisdiction over Bruiser's Bill. Elle also finds that Congresswoman Libby Hauser, the [[Ranking minority member|Ranking Member]] of the same committee, was a member of Elle's [[sorority]] Delta Nu. As a result, both Marks and Hauser warm to Elle and eventually come to support Bruiser's Bill.\n\nElle also discovers that Congresswoman Rudd has actually been working against her. She has been trying to satisfy the interests of a major campaign donor named \"Bob\" (who is [[Unseen character|never seen]], but with whom Rudd has several telephone conversations).\n\nHowever, Rudd is eventually blackmailed into supporting Elle's petition thanks to her Chief of Staff, Grace Rossiter. She has a recorded conversation during which Rudd admits to Elle that she has been working against Bruiser's Bill in order to help her sponsors who want to continue testing on animals.\n\nAs Grace is appalled that Rudd lied to Elle and blamed it on her, Grace and Elle eventually reach a place of mutual respect, especially after Grace admits she came to Washington D.C. with an enthusiasm not unlike Elle's, but later lost that idealism when she discovered how dirty politics could really be.\n\nWith the help of her friends, Elle's [[discharge petition]] is successful, and Bruiser's Bill is brought to the floor of the House. Bruiser's mother and the rest of the dogs are released by C'est Magnifique Corporation.\n\nElle and Emmett get married in a park in D.C., albeit not at [[Fenway Park]] as they had planned, but standing on the home plate which has been delivered to D.C. by Paulette's husband. Emmett asks Elle where she wants to live since they are now a married couple, and he goes on to suggest the cities of Boston, New York City, and Washington DC. Elle glances at the White House, winking at the camera as the movie ends.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as [[Elle Woods]]\n* [[Moonie (dog)|Moonie]] as Bruiser Woods\n* [[Sally Field]] as Victoria Rudd\n* [[Regina King]] as Grace Rossiter\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Paulette Bonafont\u00e9\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Emmett Richmond\n* [[Bob Newhart]] as Sid Post\n* [[Bruce McGill]] as Stan Marks\n* [[Dana Ivey]] as Libby Hauser\n* [[Jessica Cauffiel]] as Margot Chapman\n* [[Alanna Ubach]] as Serena McGuire\n* [[Taco Bell chihuahua|Gidget]] as Bruiser's Mom\n* [[Bruce Thomas (actor)|Bruce Thomas]] as UPS Guy\n* [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]] as Reena Giuliani\n* J.
