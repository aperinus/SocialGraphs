It chronicles a series of unfortunate events that befall a good-hearted but hapless nurse ([[Ben Stiller]] as Greg Focker) while visiting his girlfriend's parents ([[Robert De Niro]] as Jack Byrnes and [[Blythe Danner]] as Dina Byrnes). [[Teri Polo]] as Pam Byrnes and [[Owen Wilson]] as Kevin Rawley also star.\n\nThe film is a remake of a 1992 [[Meet the Parents (1992 film)|film of the same name]] directed by [[Greg Glienna]] and produced by Jim Vincent. Glienna \u2013 who also played the original film's protagonist \u2013 and Mary Ruth Clarke cowrote the screenplay. [[Universal Pictures]] purchased the rights to Glienna's film with the intent of creating a new version. Jim Herzfeld expanded the original script but development was halted for some time. Jay Roach read the expanded script and expressed his desire to direct it but Universal declined him. At that time, [[Steven Spielberg]] was interested in doing so while [[Jim Carrey]] was interested in playing the lead role.<ref>{{cite web|title=Carrey Has 'No Regrets' Over Meet The Parents|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/jim-carrey/news/carrey-has-no-regrets-over-meet-the-parents_1089627|website=ContactMusic|date=16 December 2008|access-date=28 July 2015|archive-date=27 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927160049/http://www.contactmusic.com/jim-carrey/news/carrey-has-no-regrets-over-meet-the-parents_1089627|url-status=live}}</ref> The studio only offered the film to Roach once Spielberg and Carrey left the project.\n\nReleased in the United States and Canada on October 6, 2000 and distributed by Universal Pictures, the film earned back its initial budget of $55 million in only 11 days. It went on to become one of the highest-grossing films of 2000, earning over $165 million in North America and over $330 million worldwide. It was well received by film critics and viewers alike, winning several awards and earning additional nominations. Ben Stiller won two comedy awards for his performance and the film was chosen as the Favorite Comedy Motion Picture at the 2001 [[People's Choice Awards]]. The success of the film inspired two sequels, namely ''[[Meet the Fockers]]'' and ''[[Little Fockers]]'' released in 2004 and 2010, respectively. It also inspired a reality television show titled ''[[Meet My Folks]]'' and a sitcom titled ''[[In-Laws]]'', both of which debuted on [[NBC]] in 2002.\n\n==Plot==\nGaylord \"Greg\" Focker is a nurse living in [[Chicago]]. He intends to propose to his girlfriend, Pam Byrnes, but his plan is disrupted when they are invited to the wedding of Pam's sister, Debbie, at their parents' house on [[Long Island]]. Greg decides to impress Pam's parents first, and propose to her in front of her family, but this plan is put on hold when the airline company loses his luggage which contains the [[engagement ring]].\n\nAt the Byrnes's house, Greg meets Pam's father, Jack, mother, Dina, and their beloved cat, Jinx. Despite maintaining a friendly demeanor towards him, Jack is immediately suspicious of Greg and openly criticizes him for his choice of career as a male nurse and anything else he sees as a difference between Greg and the Byrnes family. Greg attempts to impress Jack, but his efforts fail. He becomes even more uncomfortable after he receives an impromptu [[Polygraph|lie detector]] test from Jack and later learns from Pam that Jack is a retired [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative who interrogated double agents.\n\nMeeting the rest of Pam's family and friends, Greg still feels like an outsider. Despite efforts to impress her family, his inadvertent actions make him an easy target for ridicule. Greg unintentionally gives Debbie a broken nose and a black eye during a pool volleyball game, uses a malfunctioning toilet which floods the Byrnes' backyard with sewage, and sets the wedding altar on fire. Several misunderstandings also cause Jack to believe Greg is a [[cannabis|marijuana]] user after Pam's weed-using brother, Denny, unintentionally frames him.\n\nLater, Greg loses Jinx and replaces him with a stray whose tail he spray-paints to make him look like Jinx, which happens to also make a mess of the house including destroying Debbie's wedding dress (though the real Jinx is later found). By now, the entire Byrnes family, including Pam, agrees that it is best for Greg to leave Long Island and go home. Desperate to save himself, Greg reveals he has seen Jack engaging in some secret activity with some shady characters, and that Jack is planning a secret mission after the wedding. Jack angrily reveals that the secret mission was a surprise honeymoon for Debbie and her fianc\u00e9 Bob, and Greg realizes he has only dug himself deeper into a hole. Jack also accuses Greg of lying about being a nurse and taking the [[Medical College Admission Test]] because his CIA pals could not find any record of a \"Gregory\" Focker.\n\nGreg's missing luggage arrives and unfortunately for Greg his real name Gaylord is accidentally revealed, much to the amusement of the Byrnes family. Greg drives sadly to the airport preparing to return Chicago, he is later detained by airport security for insisting that his luggage stays with him rather than be checked. Back at the Byrnes's house, Jack learns from a disappointed Pam that he could find no record of Greg from the CIA because his real name is Gaylord, and is presented with copies of Greg's transcripts his parents faxed her, proving that Greg passed the Medical College Admission Test. Despite this, Jack still states his belief that Greg is an unsuitable husband for Pam because of the mistakes and lies he made, but is told off by Dina over his consistent picking apart of any man Pam brings home (and that he didn't even like Pam's previous fianc\u00e9, Kevin, until after they broke up).\n\nAfter hearing Pam make a heartfelt phone call to Greg to apologize for not sticking up for him earlier, Jack realizes that Pam truly loves Greg. He rushes to the airport, convinces airport security to release Greg, and brings him back to the Byrnes's house. Jack performs a lie detector test on Greg to tell the truth about the weekend and loving Pam, leading Jack to propose to Greg to be his son-in-law.\n\nAs Greg is proposing to Pam, Jack and Dina listen in on their conversation from another room, agreeing that they should now meet Greg's parents (though both are visibly worried about this). After Debbie's wedding, Jack views footage of Greg recorded by hidden cameras that he had placed strategically around the house in which Greg calls Jack a \"psycho\" and mocks him and exposes Denny as the true marijuana user.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n*[[Robert De Niro]] as Jack Byrnes, a retired [[CIA]] agent and a [[Vietnam War]] [[war veteran|veteran]] who is overprotective of his family and takes an instant dislike towards Greg\n*[[Ben Stiller]] as Gaylord \"Greg\" Focker, a male nurse and Pam's boyfriend, who seeks to impress her parents\n*[[Teri Polo]] as Pam Byrnes, a 2nd grade teacher, who is Greg's girlfriend and Jack and Dina's older daughter\n*[[Blythe Danner]] as Dina Byrnes, Jack's wife and Pam's mother \n*[[Nicole DeHuff]] as Debbie Byrnes, the younger sister of Pam, Jack and Dina's younger daughter and Bob's fianc\u00e9e\n*[[Jon Abrahams]] as Denny Byrnes, brother of Pam and Debbie, and Jack and Dina's youngest child\n*[[Owen Wilson]] as Kevin Rawley, the wealthy stock investor/carpenter ex-fianc\u00e9 of Pam\n*[[James Rebhorn]] as Larry Banks, Bob's father and a close friend of Jack, who is a plastic surgeon\n*[[Tom McCarthy (director)|Thomas McCarthy]] as Bob Banks, Larry and Linda's son, a doctor and Debbie's fianc\u00e9\n*[[Phyllis George]] as Linda Banks, Larry's wife and Bob's mother\n}}\n\n==Themes==\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=\"But I was trying to have in a kind of forties-farce way, the opportunity to create realistic characters, but heighten the comedic situations and predicaments a bit so that they're still very funny and there is still some very broad humor, but you would connect to the characters and completely identify with Ben Stiller's anxiety about not only meeting Robert De Niro's character and all, but the kind of characters from his past that come with him.\"|source=Jay Roach<ref name=\"DVDTALK\">Kleinman, Geoffrey.

The cultural differences are often highlighted, and Greg repeatedly made aware of them. This serves to achieve comedic effect through character development and has also been commented upon as being indicative of thematic portrayal of Jewish characters' roles in modern film as well as being a prime example of how male nurses are portrayed in media.<ref name=\"Brook 240, 241\">{{harvnb|Brook|2006|pp=240, 241}}</ref><ref name=\"Bower 97-99\">{{harvnb|Bower|2004|pp=97\u201399}}</ref><ref name=\"SUMMERS\">{{harvnb|Summers|Summers|2009|pp=172, 173}}</ref> Speaking about character development in ''Meet the Parents'', director Jay Roach stated that he wanted an opportunity to \"do character-driven comedy\"<ref name=\"DVDTALK\"/> and \"to create realistic characters, but heighten the comedic situations and predicaments.\"<ref name=\"DVDTALK\"/>\n\nVincent Brook observes mainstream Hollywood cinema's tendency since the 1990s of incorporating Jewish [[liminality]] and \"popularizing the Jew.\"<ref name=\"Brook 240, 241\"/> He explains the \"manly Jewish triumph\"<ref name=\"Brook 240, 241\"/> of characters like [[Jeff Goldblum]]'s David Levinson in ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' and labels it as a \"certain answer to America's yearnings for a new Jewish hero.\"<ref name=\"Brook 240, 241\"/> This stands in direct contrast to the [[wikt:schlemiel|schlemiel]] or \"the Jewish fool\"<ref name=\"Brook 240, 241\"/> which was seen to have been revitalized in the mid-1990s after faltering since the 1960s. The schlemiel, Brook explains, is an anti-hero in whose humiliation the audience finds supreme pleasure. Within that context, Brook describes Greg Focker's character as \"the quintessential example of the postmodern schlemiel.\"<ref name=\"Brook 240, 241\"/> The repeated embarrassing encounters that Greg faces with his girlfriend's all-American family is compared to the example of [[Jason Biggs]]'s character Jim Levenstein of the [[American Pie (film series)|''American Pie'' film series]] where Levenstein is often the comedic centerpiece due to his repeated sexual embarrassments.<ref>{{harvnb|Brook|2006|p=241}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Meet the Parents grace.JPG|thumb|300px|left|At the insistence of his Christian host, the Jewish Greg agrees to say a prayer to bless the food at the dinner table.

In this scene, Greg attempts to recite a prayer by improvising and, in doing so, launches into a recital of the song [[Day by Day (Godspell song)|\"Day by Day\"]] from Act I of ''[[Godspell]]''. Bower notes this scene as \"particularly important for establishing the cultural distance\"<ref name=\"Bower 99\"/> between the Jewish Greg and the Christian Byrnes. She noted that the social gap is further widened next morning when Greg is the last person to arrive at the breakfast table; he shows up wearing pajamas while everyone else is fully clothed. Here Greg is shown eating a [[bagel]], which Bower argues as being a clear signifier of Jewishness.<ref name=\"Bower 99\"/>\n\nBased on common misconceptions and stereotypes about [[men in nursing]], Greg's profession is repeatedly brought up by Jack in a negative context and the character of Greg Focker has come to be one of the best known film portrayals of a male nurse.<ref name=\"SUMMERS\"/> Even though men dominated the profession in earlier times,<ref>{{harvnb|O'Lynn|Tranbarger|2007|p=6}}</ref> there has been a feminization of the nursing profession over the course of the last century which has caused men in nursing to often be portrayed as misfits by the media.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Lynn|Tranbarger|2007|p=172}}</ref> A common stereotype is that of a man who accepts a career in nursing as an unfortunate secondary career choice, either failing to become a physician or still trying to become one. Such stereotyping is due to a presumption that a man would prefer to be a physician but is unable to become one due to lack of intelligence or non-masculine attributes. Jack is often seen openly criticizing Greg's career choice per his perception of nursing being an effeminate profession. In their book ''Men in Nursing: History, Challenges, and Opportunities'' authors Chad O'Lynn and Russell Tranbarger present this as an example of a negative portrayal.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Lynn|Tranbarger|2007|p=257}}</ref> Commenting on the same issue but disagreeing, Barbara Cherry in her book ''Contemporary Nursing: Issues, Trends, & Management'' called the portrayal of Greg as a nurse \"one of the most positive film portrayals of men who are nurses\"<ref name=\"CHERRY\">{{harvnb|Cherry|2005|p=34}}</ref> and commented that Greg \"humorously addresses and rises above the worst of all stereotypes that are endured by men in this profession.\"<ref name=\"CHERRY\"/> Sandy and Harry Summers in the book ''Saving Lives: Why the Media's Portrayal of Nurses Puts Us All at Risk'' postulate that Greg's character, although intelligent and firm in his defense of his profession, \"might have done more to rebut the stereotypes\"<ref name=\"SUMMERS\"/> while also reporting that \"some men in nursing\"<ref name=\"SUMMERS\"/> expressed their opinions that it would have been better to not present the stereotypes at all.<ref name=\"SUMMERS\"/>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Background===\n{{main|Meet the Parents (1992 film)}}\nThe film is a [[remake]] of a 1992 [[independent film]] of the same name.<ref name=\"STUMPED\">[http://stumpedmagazine.com/Articles/the-boys-who-met.html The Boys Who Met the Parents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716160630/http://stumpedmagazine.com/Articles/the-boys-who-met.html |date=2011-07-16 }}, ''Stumped''.
