The next day, Colt and Tum-Tum encounters a same group of men led by J.J. harassing and assaulting a girl named Jo from the protest at the pizza parlor after she demands them about her father's whereabouts. Colt, Tum-Tum and Rocky step in to protect her by fighting them and getting cheered on by the admiring customers. After fending off the men with their martial arts techniques, they are praised as heroes which gives them big heads. However, the boys are put to work by Mori and the owner of the pizza parlor to work off damages from their fight. Mori tries to teach them a lesson in humility, but the reference of a flower blooming goes over their heads. Jo comes to the boys later at the pizza parlor and explains that the men are under the employ of Jack Harding, an industrialist who is illegally dumping toxic contents into the Native American reserve. Without proof, they can do nothing. Jo's father named Charlie had gone to investigate, but he had not returned. Colt, who is seemingly attracted to Jo, agrees that they will help and find her father. The boys follow and sneaks into Jack's waste management, overheard his conversation with the Mayor about corruption and founds Charlie imprisoned. The boys managed to fight of the some of Jack's men and escape as they report Jo. That night, they mount an escape plan for her father, which is successful. They spend the night celebrating with the tribe and getting thanks for helping them. During the dance, Jack and his men attack them once again until the boys and Native Americans fight them off with the help of Mori, who suspicious about his grandsons.\n\nCharlie and his family prepares and appeals for a court date with significant evidence to put Jack out of business for good. Soon, Jack arranges to have Jo kidnapped by the [[Outlaw motorcycle club|Bikers]] and convince her father to falsify his evidence, which he has no other choice for her safety.\n\nRocky and his brothers get the information to find where Jo is being held hostage, drive out to rescue her and return before the court case is dismissed and all of Charlie's hard work accounts for nothing at all. After fighting through a small band of armed bikers at the abandoned town, they found Jo and return her to the court house. The boys arrive and fight off Jack's men and the [[Sheriff|Sheriffs]] as Jo arrives to the courtroom just before her father about to turn the real evidence over to Jack. Charlie punches Jack, admits his mistake and hands the real evidence to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] representative who signifies the case and shuts down the company producing the waste.\n\nAs the boys leave the court, Jo and her family looks around for the 'heroes' of the day, but they are nowhere to be found. Returning to Mori's home, Rocky, Colt and Tum-Tum realizes the point of Mori's earlier lesson: that a flower is content to bloom quietly, without clamoring for attention. The film ends with Grandpa Mori and the boys somersaulting into the air in victory.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Victor Wong (actor born 1927)|Victor Wong]] as Grandpa Mori Tanaka\n* [[Michael Treanor]] as Samuel 'Rocky' Douglas Jr.\n* [[Max Elliott Slade]] as Jeffrey 'Colt' Douglas\n* Chad Power as Michael 'Tum-Tum' Douglas\n* [[Crystle Lightning]] as Jo\n* [[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]] as Jack Harding\n* [[Patrick Kilpatrick]] as J.J.\n* [[Donal Logue]] as Jimmy\n* [[Scott MacDonald (actor)|Scott MacDonald]] as Eddy\n* Don Shanks as Charlie\n* Sheldon Peters Wolfchild as Lee\n* Nick Ramus as Chief Roundcreek\n* [[Vincent Schiavelli]] as The Mayor\n* Selina Jayne as Jo's Mother\n* [[Don Stark]] as The Sheriff\n* Dennis Holahan as Dean Thompson\n* Michael Hungerford as Truck Driver\n* Cathy Perry as Reporter\n* Wayne Collins Jr. as Kid #1\n* Janie Melissa Gunderson as Kid #2\n* Danuel Pipoly as Kid #3\n* Amanda Nicole Power as Kid #4\n* Adam Treanor as Kid at Pizza Parlor\n* Erin Treanor as Pizza Parlor Girl\n* Gary Epper as Biker #1\n* Eric Mansker as Biker #2\n* Ted Pitsis as Town Man\n* Stuart Proud Eagle Grant as Indian #1\n* Jeff Cadiente as Indian #2\n* David Cadiente as Indian On Truck\n* Al Goto as Indian On Truck\n* Pat Van Ingen as Indian Grandmother\n* Brett Jones as Thug at Indian Rally and Pizza Parlor and Indian Ceremony and Court House and Waste Plant Worker\n* Richard Cetrone as Thug at Pizza Parlor and Court House\n* Mark Orrison as Waste Plant Guard\n* Hunter Brown as Waste Plant Worker and Thug at Indian Ceremony\n* Bobby Burns as Waste Plant Worker\n* Dane Farwell as Waste Plant Worker\n* Melvin Jones as Waste Plant Worker\n* Gene LeBell as Waste Plant Worker\n* Gary Littlejohn as Waste Plant Worker\n* Dwayne McGee as Waste Plant Worker and Thug at Indian Ceremony and Court House\n* Denney Pierce as Waste Plant Worker and Thug at Indian Ceremony\n* Steve Vandeman as Waste Plant Worker\n* William Washington as Waste Plant Worker\n* Rick Avery as Thug at Indian Ceremony\n* Dan Bradley as Thug at Indian Ceremony\n* Eugene Collier as Thug at Indian Ceremony\n* Monty Cox as Thug at Indian Ceremony\n* Bill Erickson as Thug at Indian Ceremony\n* Michael Haynes as Thug at Indian Ceremony\n* Clint Jones as Thug at Indian Ceremony\n* Clint Lilley as Thug at Indian Ceremony\n* Bill MacIntosh as Thug at Indian Ceremony\n* Don Pulford as Thug at Indian Ceremony\n* Mario Roberts as Thug at Indian Ceremony\n* Thomas Rosales Jr. as Thug at Indian Ceremony\n* Brian Smrz as Thug at Indian Ceremony\n* Erik Stabenau as Thug at Indian Ceremony\n* Michael Ragsdale as Big Hairy Biker\n* Phil Adams as Biker\n* John Alden as Biker\n* Brian Avery as Biker\n* Brad Billington as Biker\n* Jeff Bornstein as Biker\n* John Branagan as Biker\n* Kurt Bryant as Biker\n* Keith Campbell as Biker\n* Michael Cassidy as Biker\n* Doc D.
