It tells the story of an unmarried piano teacher ([[Isabelle Huppert]]) at a Vienna [[music school|conservatory]], living with her mother ([[Annie Girardot]]) in a state of emotional and sexual disequilibrium, who enters into a sadomasochistic relationship with her student ([[Beno\u00eet Magimel]]). A co-production of Austria and France, Haneke was given the opportunity to direct after previous attempts to adapt the novel by filmmakers [[Valie Export]] and [[Paulus Manker]] collapsed for financial reasons.\n\nAt the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]], it won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]]; the two leads, Huppert and Magimel, won [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actress]] and [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor]]. It went on to receive positive reviews and other awards and nominations.\n\n==Plot==\nErika Kohut is a piano professor in her late 30s at a Vienna music conservatory who resides in an apartment with her domineering elderly mother. Her late father had been a longstanding resident in a psychiatric asylum. Despite Erika's aloof and assured fa\u00e7ade, she is a woman whose [[sexual repression]] and loneliness is manifested in her [[paraphilia]], including [[voyeurism]], [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic fetishes]], and [[Self-harm|self-mutilation]].\n\nAt a recital hosted by the Blonskij couple, Erika meets Walter Klemmer, a young aspiring engineer who also plays piano, and who expresses admiration of her talent for classical music. The two share an appreciation for composers [[Robert Schumann]] and [[Franz Schubert]], and he attempts to apply to the conservatory to be her pupil. His audition impresses the other professors, but Erika, though visibly moved by his playing, votes against him; she cites his divergent interpretation of Schubert's [[Andantino (music)|Andantino]], and questions his motivations. Despite this, Walter is admitted as Erika's pupil. Meanwhile, another pupil, Anna Schober, struggles with anxiety while pushed by her own ambitious mother. However, when Erika witnesses Anna and Walter socializing, she slips to an empty coatroom and smashes a glass, hiding the shards inside one of Anna's coat pockets. This cuts Anna's right hand, preventing her playing at the forthcoming jubilee concert.\n\nWalter pursues Erika into a lavatory after she secretly injured Anna. Walter passionately kisses Erika, and she responds by repeatedly humiliating and frustrating him. She proceeds to give him a [[handjob]] before performing [[fellatio]] on him, but abruptly stops when he does not abide by her orders to be silent and to look at her and not to touch her. She tells him she will write him a letter regarding their next meeting. Later at the conservatory, Erika feigns sympathy for Anna's mother, with Erika saying only she can substitute for Anna in the upcoming school concert at such a late stage.\n\nWalter is increasingly insistent in his desire to initiate a sexual relationship with Erika, but Erika is only willing if he will satisfy her masochistic fantasies. She gives him the letter indicating acts she will consent to. He follows her home and reads the letter in her bedroom, but the list repulses him and he leaves. Later that night, Erika\u2019s mother is berating her while they lay in bed together for letting Walter in her bedroom in the middle of the night, when Erika suddenly begins kissing and groping her mother. Her mother resists and tells Erika she is unwell.\n\nErika finds Walter at an ice rink after his [[ice hockey|hockey]] practice to apologize. She begins to subjugate herself to him in a janitorial closet. Walter says he loves her and they begin to have sex, but Erika is unable to, and vomits while performing fellatio. Later that night, Walter arrives at Erika's apartment and attacks her in the fashion described in her letter. He locks her mother away in her bedroom before proceeding to beat and rape Erika.\n\nThe next day, Erika brings a large kitchen knife to the concert where she is scheduled to substitute for Anna. When Walter arrives, he enters cheerfully, laughing with his family, and flippantly greets her. Moments before the concert is due to start, a distraught Erika calmly stabs herself in the shoulder with the kitchen knife and exits the concert hall into the street.\n\n==Cast==\n\n*[[Isabelle Huppert]] as Erika Kohut\n*[[Beno\u00eet Magimel]] as Walter Klemmer\n*[[Annie Girardot]] as The Mother\n*[[Susanne Lothar]] as Mrs. Schober\n*[[Udo Samel]] as Dr. Blonskij\n*Anna Sigalevitch as Anna Schober\n*Cornelia K\u00f6ndgen as Mme Blonskij\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Burberrys Trenchcoat.jpg|150px|left|thumb|[[Burberry]] trench coats were selected for costumes.]]\nThe film is based on the 1983 novel ''[[The Piano Teacher (Jelinek novel)|The Piano Teacher]]'' by [[Elfriede Jelinek]],<ref>{{cite book |chapter=The Key to Voyeurism: Haneke's Adaptation of Jelinek's ''The Piano Teacher'' |title=On Michael Haneke |last1=Naqvi |first1=Fatima |author-link=Fatima Naqvi |last2=Kone |first2=Christophe |date=2010 |publisher=Wayne State University Press |isbn=978-0814336991 |page=127}}</ref> who won the 2004 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/oct/08/austria.books |title=Austrian writer wary at scooping Nobel prize |last=Ezard |first=John |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=8 October 2004 |access-date=9 January 2018}}</ref> Director [[Michael Haneke]] read ''The Piano Teacher'' when it was published and aspired to adapt it to transition from making [[television film]]s to cinema.
