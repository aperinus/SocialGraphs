Inspired by the 1937 Hungarian play ''[[Parfumerie]]'' by [[Mikl\u00f3s L\u00e1szl\u00f3]] (which had earlier been adapted in 1940 as ''[[The Shop Around the Corner]]'' and in 1949 as ''[[In the Good Old Summertime]]''),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://mentalfloss.com/article/84669/9-movies-are-remakes-remakes |title=9 Movies That Are Remakes of Remakes |archive-date=August 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190818132205/https://mentalfloss.com/article/84669/9-movies-are-remakes-remakes |url-status=live |access-date=September 11, 2021 }}</ref> it was co-written by Nora and [[Delia Ephron]]. It tells the story of two people in an [[Love letter|online romance]] who are unaware they are also business rivals. It marked the third pairing of Hanks and Ryan, who previously appeared together in ''[[Joe Versus the Volcano]]'' (1990) and ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' (1993), the latter directed by Ephron.\n\n==Plot==\nKathleen Kelly is in a relationship with Frank Navasky, a left-leaning newspaper writer for ''[[The New York Observer]]'' who is always in search of an opportunity to root for the underdog. While Frank is devoted to his typewriter, Kathleen prefers her laptop and logging into her [[AOL]] email account. Using the [[User (computing)|screen name]] \"Shopgirl\", she reads an email from \"NY152\", the screen name of Joe Fox, whom she first met in an \"over-30s\" chatroom. As her voice narrates her reading of the email, she reveals the boundaries of the online relationship: no specifics, including no names, career or class information, or family connections. She only knows he has a dog named Brinkley.\n\nJoe belongs to the Fox family that runs Fox Books, a chain of mega bookstores. Kathleen runs the independent bookstore The Shop Around The Corner that she inherited from her mom. The two are shown passing each other on their respective ways to work, revealing that they frequent the same neighborhoods on the [[Upper West Side]] of Manhattan. Joe arrives at work, overseeing the opening of a new Fox Books in New York City with the help of his best friend, branch manager Kevin. Kathleen and her three store assistants, George, Aunt Birdie, and Christina, open up her small shop that morning.\n\nFollowing a day with his 11-year-old aunt Annabel and 4-year-old half-brother Matthew, Joe enters Kathleen's store to let his younger relatives experience storytime. Joe and Kathleen have a pleasant conversation that reveals Kathleen's fears about the Fox Books store opening around the corner. He omits his last name and makes an abrupt exit with the children. At a publishing party for New York book business people later that week, Joe and Kathleen meet again where Kathleen discovers Joe's true identity in the Fox family. She accuses him of deception and spying, while he responds by belittling her store.\n\nWhen \"Shopgirl\" and \"NY152\" finally decide to meet, Joe discovers with whom he has been corresponding. At the table, he joins her without revealing his online identity, leading them to clash once more. When Kathleen writes him asking him he didn't appear, adding that she had a terrible encounter with an awful person, Joe apologizes eloquently for standing her up, and tells her that whatever she said to the awful person she met probably deserved it.\n\nDespite protests against Fox Books and publicity in support of The Shop Around the Corner, sales continue to decline and Kathleen makes the heartbreaking decision to close her store. Her employees move on, including George, who gets a job in the children's department at Fox Books and ensures the staff are knowledgeable. Kathleen and Frank amicably end their relationship when they realize they don't love each other, despite being perfect for each other. Kathleen takes a break to figure out what she wants to do, and her conversations with NY152 inspire her to start writing children's books. After becoming stuck in an elevator with his acerbic girlfriend Patricia and his doorman, who resolves to propose to his girlfriend if they're rescued, Joe ends his relationship and decides to pursue Kathleen. He brings her flowers to apologize for her store closing, and they begin building a friendship, with Joe still keeping his online identity a secret. Kathleen confides in Joe about her online romance.\n\nEventually, NY152 arranges a meeting between his online persona and Shopgirl, but right before she is to meet her online friend, Joe reveals to Kathleen how he feels, hoping she would choose him over NY152 and forgive him despite their past animosity. Kathleen hints at feeling the same way but cannot bring herself to forego her feelings for NY152, not realizing they are the same man, and the two part. Upon arriving at the meeting place, she hears Joe calling Brinkley and sees that NY152 is, in fact, Joe Fox. Kathleen cries tears of joy and reveals that she hoped it would be him.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, plus 2 (kids) named in synopsis, all roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Joe Fox\n* [[Meg Ryan]] as Kathleen Kelly\n** [[Katie Sagona]] as Young Kathleen Kelly\n* [[Parker Posey]] as Patricia Eden\n* [[Jean Stapleton]] as Birdie\n* [[Dave Chappelle]] as Kevin\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as George\n* [[Dabney Coleman]] as Nelson Fox\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as Frank Navasky\n* [[Heather Burns]] as Christina\n* [[John Randolph (actor)|John Randolph]] as Schuyler Fox\n* [[Deborah Rush]] as Veronica Grant\n* [[Hallee Hirsh]] as Annabel Fox\n* [[Sara Ramirez]] as Rose, the cashier\n* [[Cara Seymour]] as Gillian Quinn\n* Jeffrey Scaperrotta as Matt Fox\n* Kathryn Meisle as Cecilia Kelly\n* [[Reiko Aylesworth]] as Thanksgiving guest\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Influences===\n''You've Got Mail'' is based on the 1937 Hungarian play ''[[Parfumerie]]'' by [[Mikl\u00f3s L\u00e1szl\u00f3]] and its adaptations.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ng |first=David |title='Parfumerie,' a 1936 Hungarian play, is an overlooked inspiration |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=November 27, 2013 |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-parfumerie-play-20131127-story.html |access-date=October 13, 2015 |archive-date=November 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124153437/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-parfumerie-play-20131127-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref> ''Parfumerie'' was later remade as ''[[The Shop Around the Corner]]'', a 1940 film by [[Ernst Lubitsch]], which in 1949 was adapted as a movie musical, ''[[In the Good Old Summertime]]'' by [[Robert Z.
