Brooks]]. The film concerns a virtuoso television news producer ([[Holly Hunter]]) who has daily emotional breakdowns, a brilliant yet prickly reporter ([[Albert Brooks]]), and the latter's charismatic but far less seasoned rival ([[William Hurt]]). It also stars [[Robert Prosky]], [[Lois Chiles]], [[Joan Cusack]], and [[Jack Nicholson]].\n\nThe film was acclaimed by critics and at the [[60th Academy Awards]] received seven nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/12/12/675384976/jurassic-park-the-shining-and-23-other-movies-added-to-national-film-registry|title='Jurassic Park,' 'The Shining,' And 23 Other Movies Added To National Film Registry|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-08-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-09-18|website=Library of Congress}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=National Film Registry Turns 30|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-18-144/library-of-congress-national-film-registry-turns-30/2018-12-12/|access-date=2020-09-18|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJane Craig is a talented but intense news producer whose life revolves around her work. She is passionate about reporting, and abhors the trend towards [[soft news]] in news broadcasts. Her best friend and collaborator, Aaron Altman, is a gifted writer and reporter, but is lacking in many social skills. The two work in the [[Washington, D.C.]] [[News bureau|bureau]] of a national TV network. The bureau hires Tom Grunick, a local news anchorman who started his career in sports. Tom is tall, handsome, likable, and telegenic, but lacks news experience and isn't especially bright. He constantly seeks help from Jane to assist him with his reporting, who resents his lack of qualifications, but finds herself attracted to him. Tom is also attracted to Jane, but is intimidated by her skills and intensity.\n\nAaron and Jane go to [[Nicaragua]] to report on the [[Sandinista]] rebels there and get caught up in a shooting battle between them and the [[contras]] but remain unscathed and bring home footage that wins the approval of their national anchorman. At an office party, news arrives of a [[Libya]]n plane having bombed a U.S. military base in [[Italy]]. The network chief decides to put on a [[Breaking news|special report]] on the spot, with Tom as anchor and Jane as executive producer. Aaron, who is at the party and has extensive knowledge about the subject, is devastated at Tom's selection. Jane argues that Tom lacks the skills to handle the responsibility of the report, but is overruled by the network chief. Watching from his home, Aaron calls Jane with pertinent information, which she feeds to Tom through his earpiece. With the combination of Tom's on-camera poise and Jane's hard news skills, the report is a great success. Their teamwork also intensifies their mutual attraction.  When Jane returns for drinks with colleagues later in the evening, she meets Tom as he is leaving with co-worker Jennifer. Jane later selects Jennifer for an extended assignment in [[Alaska]] so that Tom and Jennifer will not be able to pursue a relationship with each other.\n\nWanting to complete a story without outside assistance, Tom creates a piece on [[date rape]]; the piece includes an extended interview with a rape victim, where Tom is shown tearing up in reaction to her story. Aaron and Jane are unimpressed with the story, but Jane finds it affecting nonetheless. In the face of potential layoffs, Aaron receives an opportunity to anchor the weekend news due to most of his colleagues going to the [[White House Correspondents' Dinner]]. He seeks advice from Tom, who encourages Aaron to be more salesman-like in his approach. Aaron writes high-quality copy and takes Tom's advice, but during the broadcast begins sweating uncontrollably, resulting in a disastrous broadcast. Meanwhile, Jane and Tom begin to progress romantically at the White House Correspondents' Dinner.  But before things get more involved, Jane leaves to console Aaron. The two have a heated argument, where Aaron tells Jane that Tom represents everything Jane hates about the direction of news media.  Aaron also tells Jane that he is in love with her.\n\nThe forewarned layoffs hit the network, resulting in many colleagues losing their jobs. Tom is moved to the London office, indicating that he is being groomed for a national anchor position; Jane is promoted to bureau chief. Tom and Jane agree to take a romantic getaway together before starting their new jobs. Aaron tenders his resignation and tells Jane he plans to take a job at a local television station in Portland, Oregon. Before he leaves, he tells Jane that Tom's tears during his date rape piece were staged; reviewing the footage, Jane realizes that Aaron is correct. Jane angrily confronts him at the airport, saying that his actions were a breach of [[Journalism ethics and standards|journalistic ethics]] and that she cannot in good conscience become personally involved with him. Tom argues with her, but eventually relents, leaving Jane behind.\n\nThe three meet again seven years later. Tom has taken over as national anchorman, Aaron has a wife and child, and Jane has a new boyfriend. Jane reveals she plans to take a managing editor role for the network in New York, working with Tom again. Tom leaves after Jane declines a dinner invitation with him and his fianc\u00e9e, while she and Aaron sit on a bench and catch up on their respective lives.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[William Hurt]] as Tom Grunick\n** Kimber Shoop as young Tom\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Aaron Altman\n** Dwayne Markee as young Aaron\n* [[Holly Hunter]] as Jane Craig\n** [[Gennie James]] as young Jane\n* [[Robert Prosky]] as Ernie Merriman\n* [[Lois Chiles]] as Jennifer Mack\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Blair Litton\n* [[Peter Hackes]] as Paul Moore\n* [[Christian Clemenson]] as Bobby\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as Bill Rorish\n* [[Leo Burmester]] as Mr. Craig\n* [[Marita Geraghty]] as Date-Rape Woman\n* [[Glen Roven]] as News Theme Writer\n* [[Marc Shaiman]] as News Theme Writer\n* [[John Cusack]] as Angry Messenger\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe score was by [[Bill Conti]].
