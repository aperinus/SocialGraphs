The film tells three linear stories: Luke ([[Ryan Gosling]]), a motorcycle stunt rider who supports his family through a life of crime; Avery ([[Bradley Cooper]]), an ambitious policeman who confronts his corrupt police department; and two troubled teenagers ([[Emory Cohen]] and [[Dane DeHaan]]) who explore the aftermath of Luke and Avery's actions fifteen years later. The supporting cast includes [[Eva Mendes]], with [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[Rose Byrne]], [[Mahershala Ali]], [[Bruce Greenwood]], [[Harris Yulin]], and [[Ray Liotta]].\n\nCianfrance was inspired to write ''The Place Beyond the Pines'' based on his experiences as a father. Coccio and Marder, who shared similar interests in film and media, helped write the script. Cianfrance envisioned the main themes to be about fathers and sons, [[Masculinity|masculine]] identity and legacy. The film reunites Cianfrance and Gosling, who had previously worked together in 2010's ''[[Blue Valentine (film)|Blue Valentine]]''. The role of Luke was written for Gosling, as he expressed an interest in playing a bank robber. Filming took place in [[Schenectady, New York]], during the summer of 2011.\n\n''The Place Beyond the Pines'' premiered at the [[2012 Toronto International Film Festival]], followed by a United States theatrical release on March 29, 2013. [[Focus Features]] purchased the distribution rights after being impressed by the film screening. It received a generally positive response from critics and moderate success at the box office. The soundtrack was composed by [[Mike Patton]] and included music by Estonian composer [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]] and [[Ennio Morricone]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words -->\nIn 1995, Luke Glanton is a traveling [[Motorcycle stunt riding|motorcycle stuntman]] with a carnival. In Schenectady, Luke reunites with his ex-lover Romina Gutierrez, who is now dating another man named Kofi Kancam. Luke discovers that Romina has a baby named Jason whom he accidentally fathered the previous year but Romina never revealed to him. Luke quits the carnival tour to stay in Schenectady with Romina and Jason.\n\nLuke begins working part-time for [[auto mechanic]] Robin Van Der Hook. He asks Robin for more work, but Robin cannot offer it legitimately. Robin reveals his past as a [[bank robbery|bank robber]] and suggests they should commit several robberies together. Luke accepts the offer as Robin lets him stay in a trailer next to his place. They commit several heists; Luke robs the bank at gunpoint, uses his motorcycle to get away, and quickly rides it into an inconspicuous [[box truck]], driven by Robin.\n\nLuke seduces Romina and they have sex at his trailer. He begins spending more time with her and Jason. Later, Luke lets himself into Romina and Kofi's house and attempts to assemble a [[Infant bed|crib]] for Jason. Kofi demands that Luke leave, but Luke strikes him with a wrench. He is arrested and Robin bails him out of jail; Luke explains that he wants to give his money to Romina for Jason's future. Desperate and angry, Luke insists on resuming their robberies, but Robin refuses. The pair fall out, and Robin dismantles Luke's motorcycle. Luke then robs Robin and uses the money to buy a new bike.\n\nLuke attempts to rob a bank alone but it does not go according to plan. He is quickly pursued by police and then flees on foot. He enters a stranger's home and goes to the top floor, phones Romina, and asks her not to tell Jason about him. A rookie police officer, Avery Cross, enters the room and impulsively shoots Luke in the stomach. Luke fires back, hitting Avery in the leg, but Luke falls out of the window to his death.\n\nAvery, a married man with a wife and baby son, is hailed as a hero after the incident. He feels remorseful, but tells amenable police investigators that Luke shot first. A group of veteran, corrupt officers coerce Avery to join them in illegally seizing the stolen bank money from Romina's home. Later, Avery tries to return it to Romina, who rejects it. Avery attempts to hand the money over to the corrupt chief of police, who rebuffs him. Discouraged and fearful of lethal retaliation from the corrupt police department, Avery secretly records other illegal practices in the department and uses this recording as leverage with the [[district attorney]] to obtain a coveted position as an [[assistant district attorney]].\n\nFifteen years later in 2012 , Avery is running for [[Attorney General of New York]]. His son, A.J., is a [[Rebellion|rebellious]] teenager and a drug user, who has been living with Avery's ex-wife, Jennifer. A.J. moves in with his father and transfers to [[Schenectady High School]]. A.J. befriends the now-teenage Jason, but neither know the history between their fathers. The pair are later arrested for [[felony]] [[drug possession]], but when Avery collects his son from the police station, he recognizes Jason's name. He gets Jason's charge dropped to a [[misdemeanor]] and orders A.J. to stay away from him.\n\nKofi tells Jason his father's name, allowing Jason to discover Luke's past on the internet. Jason visits Robin, who tells him more about Luke, and their robberies. In school, A.J. pressures Jason to steal [[Oxycontin]] for a party. At the party, Jason discovers that A.J.'s father, Avery, is the man who killed his father, Luke. After a violent confrontation with A.J., Jason is hospitalized and then buys a gun shortly after being released. He goes to the Cross family home, assaults A.J., and takes Avery as [[hostage]]. Jason forces him to drive into the woods, where Avery breaks down and apologizes. Jason leaves him unharmed but takes his wallet. Inside it, Jason finds a photo of him and his parents, which Avery had stolen from the evidence locker.\n\nSome time later, Avery wins his bid for New York attorney general, celebrating with A.J. at his side. Romina receives an envelope addressed to \"Mom\", with the old photograph inside. Jason purchases a motorcycle and rides away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as Luke Glanton\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as Avery Cross\n* [[Eva Mendes]] as Romina Gutierrez<ref>{{Cite web|last=Fleming|first=Mike Jr.|date=2011-06-14|title=Eva Mendes, Greta Gerwig In Talks For 'The Place Beyond The Pines'|url=https://deadline.com/2011/06/eva-mendes-greta-gerwig-in-talks-for-the-place-beyond-the-pines-139679/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025043050/https://deadline.com/2011/06/eva-mendes-greta-gerwig-in-talks-for-the-place-beyond-the-pines-139679/|archive-date=October 25, 2019|access-date=2020-09-07|website=Deadline Hollywood|language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Dane DeHaan]] as Jason Glanton\n* [[Emory Cohen]] as A.J.

In 2007, the birth of Cianfrance's second son reignited the idea, and he started to think about being a father again and the responsibilities involved. \"That got me to thinking about the fire I felt inside me, which had been with me for as long as I could remember.
