It stars Icelandic musician [[Bj\u00f6rk]] as a factory worker who suffers from a degenerative eye condition and is saving for an operation to prevent her young son from suffering the same fate. [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]], [[Cara Seymour]], [[Peter Stormare]], [[Siobhan Fallon Hogan]] and [[Joel Grey]] also star. The soundtrack for the film, ''[[Selmasongs]]'', was written mainly by Bj\u00f6rk, but a number of songs featured contributions from [[Mark Bell (British musician)|Mark Bell]] and some of the lyrics were written by von Trier and [[Sj\u00f3n]].\n\n''Dancer in the Dark'' is the third film in von Trier's \"Golden Heart Trilogy\", following ''[[Breaking the Waves]]'' (1996) and ''[[The Idiots]]'' (1998).<ref>{{Cite web|last=EmanuelLevy|title=Dancer in the Dark (2000): Von Trier's Cannes Fest Top Prize-Winning Film Starring Bjork {{!}} Emanuel Levy|url=https://emanuellevy.com/review/dancer-in-the-dark-4/|access-date=17 August 2021|language=en-US}}</ref> It was an international [[co-production (filmmaking)|co-production]] among companies based in thirteen European and North American countries and regions.<ref>{{Cite web |title=DANCER IN THE DARK (2000) |url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8182fa8a |access-date=7 February 2021 |website=BFI |language=en |surname=BFI}}</ref> It was shot with a handheld camera, and inspired by a [[Dogme 95]] look.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Molly Malene Stensgaard \"Dialogue with the Audience\"|url=https://www.visegradfilmforum.com/2020/news/news-detail/article/molly-malene-stensgaard-a-sense-of-continuity/|access-date=17 August 2021|website=Visegrad Film Forum|language=en}}</ref>\n\n''Dancer in the Dark'' premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]] to [[standing ovation]]s and polarized reviews from critics, but was nonetheless awarded the [[Palme d'Or]], along with the [[Best Actress]] award for Bj\u00f6rk.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dancer in the Dark {{!}} film by von Trier [2000]|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Dancer-in-the-Dark|access-date=17 August 2021|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> The song \"[[I've Seen It All]]\", with [[Thom Yorke]], was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] but lost to \"[[Things Have Changed]]\" by [[Bob Dylan]] from ''[[Wonder Boys (film)|Wonder Boys]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popservations.com/lost-and-found/swan-song/|title=Swan song|access-date=17 August 2021|website=www.popservations.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] in 1964, Selma Je\u017ekov\u00e1, a [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] immigrant, has moved to the United States with her 12-year-old son, Gene Je\u017eek. They live a life of poverty as Selma works at a factory with her good friend Kathy, whom she nicknames Cvalda. She rents a trailer home on the property of town policeman Bill Houston and his wife, Linda. She is also pursued by the shy but persistent Jeff, who also works at the factory.\n\nSelma is gradually losing her vision due to a degenerative eye condition, but is saving money to pay for an operation that will prevent Gene from sharing her fate. She also takes part in rehearsals for a production of ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' and accompanies Kathy to the local cinema, where together they watch Hollywood musicals, as Kathy describes them to her.\n\nIn her day-to-day life, Selma slips into daydreams, imagining herself in a musical. Jeff and Kathy begin to realize that Selma's vision is worse than they thought, and that she has been memorizing eye charts in order to pass vision tests and keep her job. Bill reveals to Selma that Linda's excessive spending has put the couple's house in danger of [[foreclosure]] by their bank. He has contemplated suicide, but cannot bring himself to carry out the act. Selma promises to keep his secret and confides in him about her advancing vision loss. Bill pretends to leave the trailer but stays, knowing that Selma cannot see him, and watches her hide her money in a tin.\n\nThe next day, Selma accidentally breaks a machine at the factory and is fired from her job. She returns home to add her last wages to the tin, but discovers it to be empty. Realizing that Bill has robbed her, she goes to his house to confront him. Linda accuses Selma of trying to [[seduce]] her husband, explaining that Bill told her Selma wanted him for his money. Not wanting to reveal her knowledge of the impending foreclosure, Selma ignores Linda and confronts Bill about the theft. They fight over the money, with Bill drawing a gun only to be accidentally shot by Selma.\n\nBill yells for Linda to call the police, saying that Selma has tried to rob him, then begs Selma to kill him; he claims that it is the only way she will ever reclaim her stolen money. Selma shoots Bill several times, but only wounds him further due to her poor vision, and finally beats him to death with a safe deposit box once the gun runs out of ammunition. She slips into a [[trance]] and imagines that Bill's corpse stands up and [[slow dance]]s with her. Taking her money back, she flees the house and pays for Gene's operation.\n\nNot knowing about the murder, Jeff takes Selma to rehearsal, where her director calls the police to have her arrested. In court, she is accused of being a [[Communism|Communist]] sympathizer and of pretending to be blind to exploit the American healthcare system. Although she tells as much truth about the situation as she can, she refuses to reveal Bill's secret, saying that she had promised not to. When her claim of sending all her money to her father in Czechoslovakia is proven false, she is convicted of murder and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]]. Kathy and Jeff eventually figure out what happened and get back Selma's money, using it instead to pay for a trial lawyer who can free her. Selma refuses the lawyer, opting to face execution by [[hanging]] rather than let her son go blind, but she is deeply distraught as she awaits her death. As Selma begins crying, Kathy runs in to tell her that the operation was successful and that Gene will see. Relieved, Selma sings the final song on the gallows with no musical accompaniment. The trap door opens and she is hanged before she can finish the last verse, whose lines are displayed as the proceedings conclude.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bj\u00f6rk]] as Selma Je\u017ekov\u00e1\n* [[Catherine Deneuve]] as Kathy (Cvalda)\n* [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]] as Bill Houston\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Jeff\n* [[Joel Grey]] as [[Old\u0159ich Nov\u00fd]]\n* [[Cara Seymour]] as Linda Houston\n* Vladica Kostic as Gene Je\u017eek\n* [[Jean-Marc Barr]] as Norman\n* [[Vincent Paterson]] as Samuel\n* [[Siobhan Fallon Hogan|Siobhan Fallon]] as Brenda\n* [[\u017deljko Ivanek]] as District attorney\n* [[Udo Kier]] as Dr. Pokorn\u00fd\n* [[Jens Albinus]] as Morty\n* Reathel Bean as Judge\n* [[Michael Flessas]] as Angry man\n* Mette Berggreen as Receptionist\n* Lars Michael Dinesen as Defense attorney\n* Katrine Falkenberg as Suzan\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as the doctor\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Tagabtmy10607200005.jpg|thumb|The Great Northern TMY locomotive]]\nThe film's title suggests the [[Fred Astaire]]/[[Cyd Charisse]] duet \"[[Dancing in the Dark (Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz song)|Dancing in the Dark]]\" from the 1953 film ''[[The Band Wagon]]'', which ties in with the film's musical theatre theme.\n\nActress [[Bj\u00f6rk]], who is known primarily as a contemporary musician, had rarely acted before, and described the process of making this film as so emotionally taxing that she would not act in any film ever again<ref>{{Cite news |title=Bjork launches celluloid comeback |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4209500.stm |work=BBC News |date=2 November 2005 |access-date=22 December 2006 |quote=Bjork vowed never to act again after making Dancer in the Dark in 2000, despite winning a best actress prize at the Cannes Film Festival.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/bjoumlrk-uncovers-dancer-36395/ |title=Bj\u00f6rk Uncovers Dancer Feud |access-date=22 December 2006 |date=October 2000 |publisher=TVGuide.com |quote=Right now, I feel very strong about focusing on music}}</ref> (although she appeared in [[Matthew Barney]]'s film installation ''[[Drawing Restraint 9]]'' in 2005, and in [[Robert Eggers]]' ''[[The Northman]]'').
