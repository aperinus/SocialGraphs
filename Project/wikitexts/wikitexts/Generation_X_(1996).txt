She is rescued from her predicament by [[Emma Frost]] ([[Finola Hughes]]) and [[Banshee (comics)|Sean Cassidy]] ([[Jeremy Ratchford]]), the headmasters of [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]]. They recruit \"Jubilee\" and offer her sanctuary at the school, a place where mutants learn to control their powers. The trio then picks up teenager [[Skin (Marvel Comics)|Angelo \"Skin\" Espinosa]] (Agustin Rodriguez) and proceed to the school where Jubilee and Skin are introduced to their fellow students; [[M (Marvel Comics)|M]] ([[Amarilis (actress)|Amarilis]]), [[Mondo (comics)|Mondo]] ([[Bumper Robinson]]), Buff ([[Suzanne Davis (actress)|Suzanne Davis]]) and Refrax (Randall Slavin). At the school the students are taught not only to cope with their mutant powers but also with a world that fears and hates them. The students are warned not to leave the school grounds lest they come into conflict with the \"townies\" from the local area.\n\nIn addition to coping with their new abilities, Jubilee and Skin find their dreams haunted by Russel Tresh ([[Matt Frewer]]), a [[mad scientist]] obsessed with the power of dreams. Tresh once worked with Emma Frost as a researcher on a project to develop a \"dream machine\" to access the dream dimension but he was fired from the team when Emma discovered his unethical behavior. Tresh believes that material extracted from mutants' brains will allow him to develop his own psychic abilities. Although Jubilee is able to resist Tresh somewhat, Skin finds himself drawn to Tresh and his promises, and unknowingly falls victim to the scientist. Instructors Frost and Cassidy soon find themselves leading the novice team against an enhanced Tresh in order to rescue the enthralled Skin - a conflict which sees the youngsters pull together as a team and leaves a catatonic Tresh trapped in the \"dream dimension\".\n\n===Movie prologue===\nThe following is a prologue quote that appeared at the beginning of the film, which was later emulated in the ''X-Men'' theatrical films with similar defining quotes on mutation and evolution, respectively, albeit in voice-over rather than on-screen text:\n\n{{blockquote|'''Mutation''': ''n''. 1. The act of being altered or changed. 2. The illegal genetic condition ['''''US Statute 5504178'''''], first apparent in puberty, caused by the X factor located in the pineal gland of the brain.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Finola Hughes]] as [[Emma Frost|Emma Frost / White Queen]]:<ref name=blastr/> She runs the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] with Banshee. She takes her job very seriously and wants to make sure that the students are sufficiently trained for any situation. Part of the reason for this may be because in her past she trained another group called the Hellions who were lost, something she blames herself for. Her powers include mind control.\n* [[Jeremy Ratchford]] as [[Banshee (comics)|Sean Cassidy / Banshee]],<ref name=blastr/> an Irish mutant, runs the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] with Emma Frost. Sean is much more laid-back in his teaching approach than Emma and wants to make sure that the students bond as a team. He can produce a sonic scream that can stun people.\n* [[Amarilis (actress)|Amarilis]] as [[M (Marvel Comics)|Monet Yvette Clarisse Maria Therese St. Croix / M]],<ref name=vty/> one of the students at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]], she  claims that she is the perfect mutant; super intelligent, enhanced physical abilities and \"level eight invulnerability\".\n* [[Heather McComb]] as [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilation Lee / Jubilee]],<ref name=blastr/> the newest student at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]], she is highly intelligent, and very curious. She can generate brightly colored bursts of plasma energy which she can fire from her hands. She also seems to have some psychic abilities.\n* [[Bumper Robinson]] as [[Mondo (comics)|Mondo]],<ref name=vty/> one of the students at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]], he is hot-headed, and gets into fights easily. He has the ability to  take on the properties of any organic or inorganic matter he touches. Consequently, he doesn't like [[Jell-O]].\n* Agustin Rodriguez as [[Skin (Marvel Comics)|Angelo Espinosa / Skin]]:<ref name=blastr/> He has skin that can stretch in a variety of different ways, including the ability to wrap himself around objects. He has a younger sister, whom Russel Tresh threatened if Skin didn't obey him. He seems to have some psychic abilities.\n* [[Suzanne Davis (actress)|Suzanne Davis]] as Arlee Hicks / Buff, one of the students at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]], she is a friendly person, whose mutation increases her muscle mass and strength.<ref name=vty/> She is insecure about her new physique and wears loose clothing to cover it up. \n* Randall Slavin as Kurt Pastorius / Refrax, one of the students at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]], his eyes emit radiation giving him X-Ray vision and heat beams.<ref name=vty/> He is a practical joker who has a crush on Buff. He wears special glasses to control his powers and is best friends with Mondo. \n* [[Matt Frewer]] as Doctor Russel Tresh,<ref name=blastr/> an unethical scientist and researcher who is investigating subliminal and psychic powers. He worked on a project with Emma Frost, who got him fired for his unethical behavior. Following this he put his talents towards the advertising industry where he uses the money to build a machine to access the \"dream dimension\".\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nSome changes were made to the characters in the development of this film. Jubilation \"Jubilee\" Lee, for example, was not portrayed as a character of Asian descent, despite the X-Men comics and broadcast series having portrayed her as [[Chinese American]].<ref name=\"blastr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/exclusive-director-jack-sholder-foxs-generation-x-controversial-castings-and-x-men-effect|title=Exclusive: Director Jack Sholder on Fox's Generation X, controversial castings and the X-Men effect|work=Blastr (now syfywire)|access-date=15 December 2014}}</ref> Two new characters, Buff and Refrax, were created to replace characters from the comics.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Goldman|first1=Eric|title=Before Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Marvel's TV History, From Spider-Man to Blade|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/20/before-agents-of-shield-marvels-tv-history-from-spider-man-to-blade?page=2|access-date=October 10, 2017|work=IGN|publisher=ZiffDavis|date=September 20, 2013|page=2}}</ref> Producer Eric Blakeney had wanted to include [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] but his powers would have been too expensive to produce on the film's budget.<ref name=\"latimes\" /> Refrax (Kurt Pastorius) was created to replace [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]], who had his chest and the lower half of his face destroyed when his powers emerged.
