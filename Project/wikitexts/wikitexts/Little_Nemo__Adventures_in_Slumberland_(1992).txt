Ultimately, the screenplay was credited to [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] and [[Richard Outten]]; the storyline and art style differed from the original version. The original [[soundtrack]] was penned by the [[Academy Award]]-winning [[Sherman Brothers]]. The film features the English dub voices of [[Gabriel Damon]], [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]], Danny Mann, and [[Bernard Erhard]].\n\nEven though it derived from an American comic strip, ''Little Nemo'' was animated by the Japanese company [[TMS Entertainment|Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] and thus is often considered an [[anime]] film, although it was a joint production of Japanese and American animators and production companies.\n\nThe movie was infamous for being in [[development hell]] with many people, some of whom worked at [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]], ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', & [[Studio Ghibli]], figures such as [[George Lucas]], [[Chuck Jones]], [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Isao Takahata]], [[Brad Bird]], [[Jerry Rees]], [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], [[Ken Anderson (animator)|Ken Anderson]], [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]], [[Ollie Johnston|Oliver Johnston]], [[Paul Julian (artist)|Paul Julian]], [[Osamu Dezaki]], [[the Sherman Brothers]] ([[Richard M. Sherman]] and [[Robert B. Sherman]]), [[Hayao Miyazaki]] (who was working at [[TMS Entertainment|TMS]] at the time), and [[Gary Kurtz]] being involved with the movie before all dropping out.\n\nThe film was first released in Japan on July 15, 1989, by the [[Toho|Toho-Towa]] and in the United States on August 21, 1992, by the [[Hemdale Film Corporation]]. It received positive reviews but earned $11.4 million on a $35 million budget and was a [[box office bomb]]. However, it sold well on home video and has since developed a cult following.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film opens with the young boy Nemo experiencing a nightmare in which he is pursued by a [[locomotive]]. Upon awakening the next day, he goes with his pet [[flying squirrel]], Icarus to see a [[parade]] welcoming a [[traveling circus]]. However, Nemo is unable to see the circus since his parents are too busy to take him. Later that night, Nemo imitates [[sleepwalking]] in an attempt to sneak some pie away, which acts against a promise he had made earlier to his mother, who catches him in the act and makes him run back to his room empty-handed. Upon actually falling asleep later that night, Nemo is approached by figures from the circus parade. The circus [[organist]] introduces himself as [[Professor Genius]] and claims that they had been sent on a mission by King Morpheus, the king of a realm named Slumberland. The mission involves Nemo becoming the playmate of the princess, Camille. Although Nemo initially has reservations about interacting with a girl, he and Icarus decide to set off to fulfill his mission after being persuaded with a gift box of cookies from the princess.\n\nNemo is taken to Slumberland in a [[dirigible]] which he is allowed to drive, causing some chaos, and is introduced to King Morpheus. Morpheus reveals that he summoned Nemo to become his heir to the throne. Morpheus gives Nemo a golden key that opens every door in the kingdom and warns him of a door with a dragon insignia that must never be opened. Nemo is introduced to Princess Camille and the pair roam the entirety of Slumberland together. Afterward, Nemo meets the mischievous clown, Flip, who angers a group of cops and forces him and Nemo to hide out in a cave. There, Nemo discovers the door that Morpheus warned him not to open. Flip tempts Nemo into unlocking the door, which unleashes \"the nightmare\". Nemo rushes back to Morpheus' castle in time for his coronation ceremony, where Nemo is handed the royal scepter, the only thing capable of defeating the Nightmare King the ruler of Nightmare Land, should he ever return to Slumberland. In the middle of a dance session between Morpheus and Genius, \"The Nightmare\" reaches the castle and steals Morpheus away. As the partygoers search for a scapegoat, Flip and Nemo accuse each other, though the responsibility goes to Nemo who had the key.\n\nNemo awakens in his home, which floods with seawater and ejects him into the ocean. Genius discovers Nemo and tells him not to blame himself for all that has happened and that Flip is to blame, but Nemo accepting the situation pledges to find the King.  When the two return to Slumberland, they rescue Flip from being shot out of a cannon because he has a map of Nightmare Land, where Morpheus is currently being held. Nemo, Icarus, Camille, Flip, and Genius set off in a tugboat in search of Morpheus. They are soon sucked into a whirlpool and find themselves in the goblin-infested Nightmare Land. The five come across a group of shapeshifting goblins called Oomps who wish to aid in the quest to rescue Morpheus. The Nightmare King sends a flock of fearsome and gigantic bats to seize the rescue party. Nemo attempts to use the scepter but awakens in his bed instead. The Oomps appear in Nemo's room and the group travels to Nightmare Castle by flying through a portal in the sky. However, they are subsequently imprisoned in the castle, where the Nightmare King demands possession of the scepter. Nemo soon uses the scepter to finally eliminate and defeat the Nightmare King but almost at the cost of Nemo's life. Slumberland celebrates the fall of the Nightmare Kingdom. Camille escorts Nemo home on the dirigible. The two nearly share a kiss before Nemo awakens in his room, where he apologizes to his mother for breaking his promise and trying to take the pie. Nemo's parents also agree to take Nemo to the circus. Nemo stares out the window as he looks forward to his new day.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Gabriel Damon]] (Takuma G\u014dno in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Nemo''': He is a human boy living in [[New York City]] who is taken to Slumberland to be the official playmate of Princess Camille; in actuality, however, he is being summoned to be the heir to the elderly King Morpheus. He is given the key to Slumberland but is warned by the king to leave a door with a coiled dragon emblazoned on it closed. Sadly, he opens the aforementioned door when he is tempted by Flip and goes on a quest to restore Slumberland to its rightful glory, save King Morpheus and defeat the Nightmare King. \n* [[Mickey Rooney]] ([[Chikao \u014ctsuka]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Flip''': He is described as a \"frightful fellow\" by Professor Genius, he is wanted throughout Slumberland for \"having fun\" (the bounty on his head is a sizeable one) and his only friend is his partner-in-crime: a bird named Flap. He tricks Nemo into accidentally releasing the Nightmare King and blames Nemo for the ruin of Slumberland. He is in possession of a map of Nightmare Land (hand-drawn and written in his own special code) and serves as the guide to the Nightmare Castle until he is replaced by the Boomps. He has a serious smoking addiction. In the real world, he is a clown in a circus that stops in Nemo's town.\n* [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] ([[K\u014dichi Kitamura]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Professor Genius''': King Morpheus' advisor. He comes to the real world to bring Nemo to Slumberland. As a sophisticated man, he is quite punctual and prefers order as opposed to madness. He is quite a dancer, as he dances quite a bit during Nemo's coronation ceremony. In the real world, he is an organ player in a circus that stops in Nemo's town.\n* Danny Mann as '''Icarus''': a [[flying squirrel]], Nemo's best friend and a supporting protagonist. Icarus is Nemo's only friend from the real world. He shows great concern for Nemo's wellbeing in a sense similar to that of two siblings. He speaks a mix of both squirrel and some English. His screech is painful to the ears of the Boomps. He detests being called a \"little rat\" (which Princess Camille mistakes him for). Unlike other squirrels, Icarus eats human food, like cookies. His initial relationship with Princess Camille, though rough, eventually changes for the better.\n* [[Bernard Erhard]] ([[Kenji Utsumi]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''King Morpheus''': The sovereign of Slumberland. He has protected Slumberland for years with the help of the royal scepter: an ancient weapon of great power. Though he is a child at heart, he knows when to be serious. He has Nemo brought to Slumberland so that he may become his heir to the throne. He gives Nemo the key to Slumberland, which can open any door; however, he warns Nemo of one door with a dragon symbol emblazoned on it that must never be opened. Like Professor Genius, he is quite a dancer, as he dances alongside the Professor during Nemo's coronation ceremony. When Nemo accidentally releases the Nightmare King, King Morpheus is captured and Nemo has to go and rescue him from Nightmare Land. In the real world, he is the ringmaster of a circus that stops in Nemo's town.\n* [[William E. Martin|Bill Martin]] ([[Tar\u014d Ishida]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''The Nightmare King''': He is a demonic horned creature who rules over the realm of Nightmares or Bad Dreams.  When Nemo goes to Nightmare Land to save King Morpheus, the Nightmare King has his minions capture Nemo's friends (Professor Genius, Flip, and Princess Camille). He is shown to be a liar and quite temperamental as he destroys several minions for the failure of just one of his underlings (the general of his army). Among his forces are a gigantic flying stingray and a presence known as \"The Nightmare\".  The only thing that can vanquish him is the royal scepter.\n* Laura Mooney ([[Hiroko Kasahara]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Princess Camille''': the daughter of King Morpheus. Though she initially acts somewhat spoiled, she eventually grows to like Nemo. She also grows fond of Icarus (and vice versa, despite a rough start). When her father is kidnapped by the Nightmare King, she takes over as sovereign but decides to join Nemo in his quest to save King Morpheus. In the real world, she is riding on an elephant in a circus that stops in Nemo's town.\n*\n* [[Greg Burson]] ([[Tessh\u014d Genda]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Nemo's father'''\n* [[Greg Burson]] as '''Flap''': Flip's bird companion.\n* [[Jennifer Darling]] (Mari Yok\u014d in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Nemo's mother'''\n* [[Neil Ross]] ([[Hiroshi \u014ctake]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Oompa''': A member of the Boomps that befriend Nemo.\n* [[Alan Oppenheimer]] ([[Keiichi Nanba]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Oomp''': A member of the Boomps that befriend Nemo.\n* [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]] ([[Masaharu Sat\u014d]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Oompo''': A member of the Boomps that befriend Nemo.\n* [[Sidney Miller (actor)|Sidney Miller]] ([[K\u014dz\u014d Shioya]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Oompe''': A member of the Boomps that befriend Nemo.\n* [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]] ([[Hiroko Emori]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Oompy''': A member of the Boomps that befriend Nemo.\n* [[Kathleen Freeman]] (Kimie Nakajima in the Japanese adaptation) as '''the dance teacher'''\n* Bever-Leigh Banfield (Seiko Nakao in the Japanese adaptation) as '''the woman'''\n* [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]] ([[Kazumi Tanaka]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''the dirigible captain'''\n* [[Bert Kramer]] ([[Yukimasa Kishino]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''a goblin''': A hideous creature that serves as a member of the Nightmare King's army. They are sent by the Nightmare King to ensure that Nemo doesn't reach his castle and free King Morpheus. Though the goblins succeed in capturing most of Nemo's friends, they fail to capture Nemo himself and, when the Nightmare King finds out, he kills them all in a fit of rage. The only goblins to survive are the Boomps (who, in contrast to the other goblins, are not hideous and are actually good).\n* [[Beau Weaver]] (Tar\u014d Arakawa in the Japanese adaptation) as '''a policeman'''\n* [[Sherry Lynn]] as '''Bon Bon''' In the real world, she and the pages are driving the wagon with the organ in a circus that stops in Nemo's town.\n* Guy Christopher as a '''Courtier''' and a '''Cop'''\n* [[Nancy Cartwright]] and [[Ellen Gerstell]] as '''pages''' In the real world, they and Bon-Bon are driving the wagon with the organ in a circus that stops in Nemo's town.\n* [[Tress MacNeille]] as an '''elevator creature'''\n* [[Michael McConnohie]] as an '''etiquette master'''\n* [[Michael Gough (voice actor)|Michael Gough]] as '''a teacher'''\n* Michael Sheehan as '''a fencing master'''\n* [[June Foray]] as '''the librarian'''\n* [[Gregg Berger]] as '''the equestrian master'''\n\n== Production ==\n''Nemo'' was the brainchild of producer Yutaka Fujioka, then president of [[TMS Entertainment|Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] (TMS). He had long realized the limitations of the animation business in Japan and wanted to enter the U.S. market, so he started a new animation studio and planned to distribute U.S.-Japan co-produced animation films worldwide.<ref name=\"magmix69782\">{{cite web|url= https://magmix.jp/post/69782|author= |title= \u5bae\u5d0e\u99ff\u76e3\u7763\u5e7b\u306e\u7c73\u30c7\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u4f5c\u300e\u30ea\u30c8\u30eb\u30fb\u30cb\u30e2\u300f \u4f01\u753b\u9014\u4e2d\u3067\u96e2\u8131\u3082\u3001\u6570\u3005\u306e\u51fa\u4f1a\u3044\u3068\u300c\u540d\u4f5c\u300d\u304c\u751f\u307e\u308c\u2026(1)|language= ja|date=2021-12-02|accessdate= 2022-04-03|website= \u30de\u30b0\u30df\u30af\u30b9|publisher= \u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30fb\u30f4\u30a1\u30fc\u30b0}}</ref><ref name=\"cinemajp\">{{cite web|url= https://cinemajp.com/2019/09/22/anime005/|author=\u897f\u5ddd\u662d\u5e78|title=\u65e5\u672c\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u6d77\u5916\u9032\u51fa\u306e\u5148\u97ad\u3092\u3064\u3051\u305f\u91ce\u5fc3\u4f5c NEMO \u30cb\u30e2\uff08\u6771\u5b9d\u6771\u548c\uff09|language= ja|date= 2019-09-22| accessdate = 2022-04-04|website= |publisher= \u65e5\u672c\u6620\u753b100\u5e74\u53f2}}</ref><ref name=\"reminder742391829\">{{cite web|url= https://reminder.top/742391829/|author= |title=\u5bae\u5d0e\u99ff\u3082\u964d\u677f\u3001\u58ee\u5927\u3059\u304e\u305f\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u300cNEMO/\u30cb\u30e2\u300d\u6620\u753b\u3088\u308a\u9762\u767d\u3044\u5236\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b!|language= ja|date= 2019-11-22|accessdate = 2022-04-04|website= Re:minder|publisher= \u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30ea\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc}}</ref>\nHe founded [[Telecom Animation Film]] in 1975, and embarked on a film adaptation of the legendary comic strip ''Little Nemo'', which was so well known in the U.S. that two film adaptations were proposed during [[Walt Disney]]'s lifetime.<ref name=\"magmix69782\"/><ref name=\"cinemajp\"/>\nAs the first step towards realizing this project, in 1977 he personally flew to [[Monterey, California]] to convince the McKay descendants to allow him to obtain the film rights, and he finally won it in the summer of 1978.<ref name=\"reminder742391829\"/>\n\nFujioka had another dream: to make a \"full animation\" (not Japanese limited animation) film that could compete with Disney.<ref name=\"reminder742391829\"/>\nFor this purpose, Fujioka hired newcomers with no experience in Japanese TV animation and had them trained by Sadao Tsukioka, followed by [[Yasuo \u014ctsuka]].<ref name=\"magmix69782\"/><ref name=\"reminder742391829\"/>\nIncidentally, the 1980 pilot film was created by Tsukioka.\n\nHowever, a lack of funding and inexperienced animators made it difficult to go into ''Nemo'' production, so he \thired veteran staff away from other studios to work on ''[[Lupin the Third Part II]]'', Hayao Miyazaki's film ''[[Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro]]'', and Isao Takahata's film ''[[Jarinko Chie (film)|Jarinko Chie]]''.\nAnd he frequently held screenings of those two films of Miyazaki and Takahata for film professionals in the U.S. to showcase his company's capabilities.<ref name=\"magmix69782\"/>\n\nIn the spring of 1981, Fujioka launched the project after securing a 4 billion yen investment from consumer finance company Lake.<ref name=\"reminder742391829\"/>\nFujioka initially approached [[George Lucas]], who was then at the height of his career with Star Wars and Indiana Jones, about co-producing the film as a foothold to penetrate the American market.<ref name=\"katabuchi_016\">{{cite web|url= http://www.style.fm/as/05_column/katabuchi/katabuchi_016.shtml|author=\u7247\u6e15\u9808\u76f4|title=\u03b2\u904b\u52d5\u306e\u5cb8\u8fba\u3067 \u7b2c16\u56de \u601d\u5f01\u7684\u306a\u30cf\u30ea\u30a6\u30c3\u30c9|date= 2009-12-21|accessdate = 2022-04-04|language= ja|website=WEB\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb|publisher=\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb}}</ref>\nLucas, however, declined the offer, citing difficulties with the initial draft plot.

Once again, it is dub-only.\n\nAfter the title went out of print, ''Little Nemo'' could be seen selling anywhere from $80 to $200 US for a sealed copy (usually DVD) on Internet sites such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] and [[eBay]]. Funimation's DVD was re-released as a budget title from [[Echo Bridge Home Entertainment]] on January 27, 2009, appearing commonly in department stores in low-price bargain bins. Then on September 20, 2011, after Echo Bridge's reissue went out of print, it was released again on DVD by [[Discotek Media]], but that release is dub-only. On November 6, 2012, Discotek released a [[Blu-ray]] of the film containing the Japanese dub and original English audio tracks and included bonus features such as the pilot films from 1984 and 1987.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Little-Nemo-Adventures-in-Slumberland-Blu-ray/48885/|title=Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland Blu-ray|website=Blu-ray.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120909190413/http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Little-Nemo-Adventures-in-Slumberland-Blu-ray/48885/|archive-date=2012-09-09|url-status=dead|access-date=April 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn March 2, 2016, [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha]]'s official [[YouTube]] channel <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzGf0DdUJVrsbcWL3e_tK1Q Anime! on TMS Official Channel]</ref> uploaded the original 95 minute film version with English dub.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRs4Y3Kzdt0 LITTLE NEMO: Adventures in Slumberland (1989) | Full Movie!]</ref>\n\n=== Video games ===\n{{Main|Little Nemo: The Dream Master}}\nAfter the Japanese release, but before the US release, [[Capcom]] developed an [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game titled ''[[Little Nemo: The Dream Master]]'', which was released in late 1990.
