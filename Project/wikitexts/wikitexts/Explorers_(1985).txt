The film stars [[Ethan Hawke]] and [[River Phoenix]], both in their film debuts, and [[Jason Presson]] as teenage boys who build a spacecraft to explore outer space. The special effects were produced by [[Industrial Light & Magic]], with make-up effects by [[Rob Bottin]].\n\nRushed into production, the film was never properly finished. Dante revealed that the studio demanded that he stop editing and rush for a July release where it was overshadowed by the [[Live Aid]] concert, which was held one day after the film's release<ref name=\"YouTubeInterview\">{{YouTube|id=KgfhkqVS8no|title=Joe Dante speaks about Explorers at the New Beverly - Pt 1/2}}</ref> and stiff competition from ''[[Back to the Future]]'', which opened nine days prior. It was a [[box-office bomb|box office failure]] upon its release, but it attracted a [[cult following]] with its VHS release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maintitles.net/reviews/explorers/ |title=Jerry Goldsmith: Explorers |last=Glorieux |first=Thomas |website=MainTitles.net |access-date=4 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nBen Crandall is a young teenage boy living in a fictional [[Maryland]] suburb, who experiences vivid dreams about flying through clouds and over a vast, city-like circuit board, usually after falling asleep watching old sci-fi films (''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'' is a favorite). Upon waking from the dream, he draws a diagram of the circuit board and shows the sketches to his friend, child prodigy Wolfgang Muller. At middle school, Ben develops a crush on Lori Swenson, but is unsure whether it is mutual. The boys also befriend punkish-but-likable Darren Woods, with whom they share their circuit-board concepts. Wolfgang builds an actual [[microchip]] based on Ben's drawings. The chip enables the generation of an electromagnetic bubble which surrounds a pre-determined area. The boys discover that the bubble is capable of moving at near-limitless distances and speeds without ill effects from inertia. They construct a rudimentary spacecraft out of an abandoned [[Tilt-A-Whirl]] car and name it the ''Thunder Road'', after [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s [[Thunder Road (song)|song of the same name]]. \n\nAfter Ben receives more dreams about the circuit board, Wolfgang discovers a means of producing unlimited sustainable [[oxygen]]; this means longer flights, whereas previously they were limited to whatever a typical oxygen tank could hold. They finalize their plan to explore the galaxy in search of alien life. The boys complete lift-off, despite interference from the authorities (one who silently wishes them well). Shortly after breaking Earth's orbit, something overrides the boys' [[personal computer]]-controls. The ''Thunder Road'' is beamed light years away into deep space and is tractor-beamed aboard a much larger spaceship. The boys venture out to meet their \"captors\", Wak and Neek: two [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] whose knowledge of Earth comes almost entirely from pop culture, particularly television reruns.\n\nThe young explorers hit it off with their extraterrestrial hosts, but then the alien ship is suddenly intercepted by a larger-still alien vessel. Wak urges the boys to leave. They are in the process of doing so when they're interrupted by a gigantic extraterrestrial who admonishes the Wak and Neek. It is revealed that Wak and Neek are brother and sister and the gigantic creature is their father; they've taken his ship out for a \"joy ride\", sending the dreams to the boys in the hopes of meeting humans. Transmissions of old movies have kept the extraterrestrial populace at a distance \u2013 except for the curious Wak and Neek \u2013 due to the way humans depict violence toward alien life.\n\nWak and Neek's father allows the ''Thunder Road'' and its crew to depart, after Wak and Neek give the boys a parting gift: an amulet which, according to the extraterrestrials, is \"the stuff dreams are made of.\" The boys make it safely back to Earth, but a malfunction results in them crashing the ''Thunder Road'' into their neighborhood lake. A week later, Ben has a dream at school in which he envisions another vast circuit board while flying through more clouds overhead. This time \u2013 thanks to Wak and Neek's amulet \u2013 Ben is joined in the dream by Wolfgang, Darren and Lori. They proclaim that the circuitry is \"really complicated\" and speculate where it may take them once completed. Lori smiles at Ben while holding his hand and they share a kiss while flying.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Benjamin \"Ben\" Crandall\n* [[River Phoenix]] as Wolfgang M\u00fcller\n* [[Jason Presson]] as Darren Woods\n* [[Amanda Peterson]] as Lori Swenson\n* [[Bobby Fite]] as Steve Jackson\n* [[Dana Ivey]] as Mrs. M\u00fcller\n* [[Taliesin Jaffe]] as Ludwig M\u00fcller\n* [[James Cromwell]] as Mr. M\u00fcller\n* [[Robert Picardo]] as Starkiller / Wak / Wak and Neek's Father\n* [[Karen Mayo-Chandler]] as Carla\n* [[Dick Miller]] as Charlie Drake\n* [[Meshach Taylor]] as Gordon Miller\n* [[Mary Kay Place]] as Mrs. Crandall\n* [[Leslie Rickert]] as Neek\n* [[Brooke Bundy]] as Science Teacher\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nA rumor persists that the script for ''Explorers'' had been circulating Hollywood offices for years before it was made, and that it was bought by the studio because a scene of \"children flying through the sky on bicycles\" appealed to [[Steven Spielberg]] for his film ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''.<ref name=\"DVD Savant\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/13355/explorers/ |title=Explorers: DVD Talk Review |last=Erickson |first=Glenn |date=19 October 2004 |website=DVD Talk |publisher=[[Internet Brands]] |access-date=17 June 2013}}</ref> The film was originally to be directed by [[Wolfgang Petersen]] having initially impressed Paramount executives with his family-targeted ''[[The NeverEnding Story (film)|The NeverEnding Story]]''. Petersen wanted to film it in his native Germany. The studio decided to settle in the States with an American director and Petersen was not long after commissioned by [[20th Century Fox]] to take over the production of ''[[Enemy Mine (film)|Enemy Mine]]''. \"The funny thing about it is that when I was first given the script, I was coming off ''[[Gremlins (film)|Gremlins]]'' and in a rare point in my career I was like 'hey, let's get this guy,'\"  said Dante during a Q&A and screening of the film in 2008. Dante liked what he read but did not feel there was a third act. \"At the end when the kids went to the planet, they go and play baseball. That was the plot. It seemed that wasn't quite enough.\" While discussing the script with Paramount executives, they said \"we can work on it while we're making the picture.\" Dante and the writer, [[Eric Luke]], were \"improvising what they were going to do\" while the film was being made.<ref name=\"YouTubeInterview\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nBoth Hawke and Phoenix make their feature film debuts. Phoenix, who had grown up in communes in South America, was somewhat unfamiliar with popular culture of North America. During rehearsals it became a running joke when he would attempt scripted well-known words and phrases and pronounce them incorrectly. Phoenix was originally considered to play Darren, but when Dante chose Jason Presson to play him, Dante thought he was good enough to play another role so he cast him against type as the nerdy Wolfgang.<ref name=\"YouTubeInterview\"/> [[Cherie Currie]] was considered for a part but, according to her autobiography, she was in the throes of drug dependency and could not even make it to a meeting.<ref>{{cite book |last=Currie |first=Cherie |author-link=Cherie Currie |date=16 March 2010 |title=Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780061961359 |url-access=registration |location=New York City |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |isbn=978-0061961359 |access-date=4 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\n\"The studio changed hands in the middle of production, and they decided they needed the movie much quicker than we thought,\" said Dante. \"So we shot the picture under very hurried auspices [sic]. The paint on the sets was literally wet and when the kids stepped into the spaceship they sunk into cement because it wasn't dry.\"'<ref name=\"YouTubeInterview\"/> During the dreams when the children fly over the circuit board, some of the camera angles and moves are meant to mimic the flight to Neverland from ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]''. When [[Robert Picardo]] was in full makeup and costume as the aliens, Wak and his father, his mouth was the only part of him not completely covered (though his mouth was made up to blend in with the faces of the creatures).\n\n\"We came up with sort of a pop culture angle on it, that we thought would be funny... audiences didn't particularly,\" said Dante.<ref name=\"YouTubeInterview\"/> The film contains various references to science fiction features, new and old, and much more when the children meet the aliens. When the boys are hovering over the drive-in, the film that is playing stars a space hero named Starkiller, named after [[George Lucas]]' original last name for [[Luke Skywalker]], and the sound effects from the movie are from the [[Atari]] video game ''[[Yar's Revenge]]''. Hawke's character, Ben, is obsessed with aliens and movies surrounding them, and the two movies he watches during the film are ''[[This Island Earth]]'' and ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]''. The children attend the \"Charles M. Jones Junior High School\", named after [[Looney Tunes]] director [[Chuck Jones]], and Wak the alien's first exchange of dialogue is of [[Bugs Bunny]]'s famous catchphrase. The song Wak performs for the kids is [[Little Richard]]'s \"All Around the World\". One character is a pet rat (trained to use a voice synthesizer) named [[Robert A. Heinlein|Heinlein]].\n\nWhile the film uses the original recording, the soundtrack album included a re-recorded remix performed by [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]].\n\n===Post-production===\nDante and his editing team submitted a rough cut by the late spring of 1985, but Paramount wanted to take advantage of the busy summer market. They changed the initial release date of late August to early July. \"They said \"just stop editing the picture, we're gonna put it out, and we got a perfect date for it and we know it'll make a lot of money,\" said Dante. There was about an hour and a half worth of footage that was left on the cutting room floor. \"There was a lot of spiritual kind of stuff in the movie that didn't make it in at all,\" Dante said. \"There's a theory that was around at the time about the world mind and it was a concept I thought was interesting. We started to get into it and there was no way to make any sense out of it, so we just dumped all that. Now the only picture where that theory is even mentioned is ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic|Exorcist II]]'' unfortunately.\"<ref name=\"YouTubeInterview\"/> Sequences had to be re-dubbed, including one near the end where the boys are under a tree, to give the film a sense of closure.<ref name=\"Fast-Rewind\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/trivia_explors.htm|title=Explorers Movie Trivia|access-date=June 16, 2013|work= fast-rewind.com}}</ref> In the drive-in scene of the young couple, the boy who calls the special effects \"fake\" is supposed to be Ben's brother. Dante says, \"there was a whole family sub-plot that is completely missing.\" The character Gordon Miller was also supposed to return in the third act.<ref name=\"YouTubeInterview\"/>\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''Explorers'' was released on July 12, 1985 on 1,750 theaters, which turned out to be the same weekend as when the [[Live Aid]] concert was being broadcast.<ref name=\"YouTubeInterview\"/> ''[[Back to the Future]]'' had also opened the previous week on July 3 (Wednesday) and dominated the summer. ''Explorers'' suffered badly its opening weekend and afterwards quickly disappeared. By the end of its run in theaters, it earned $9,873,044.<ref name=mojo>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=explorers.htm |title=Explorers (1985) |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=4 April 2014}}</ref> When the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' compared the film with other commercial failures that summer, a Paramount executive responded, \"here was a wonderful piece of material.

It's the movie I got to make up to a certain point and then had to stop.
