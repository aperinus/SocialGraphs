The film was marketed with the tagline \"She was Daddy's little girl. Now she's at that age when girls go wild, guys go crazy and Dads go nuts\". The film was shot with the working title ''Daddy's Little Girl''.\n\n== Plot ==\nWidower Doug Simpson is a radio manager from California who lives with his two daughters, Katie and Bonnie. When Katie turns 15, she feels it is time to start looking more grown up. She has been dating Richard, the boy next door, whom her father adores, since middle school. In addition, her unflattering wardrobe has been complemented by her thick glasses and full set of braces. When Doug leaves on a business trip, Katie transforms herself into a beauty with help from her father's girlfriend Janet Pearson.\n\nWhen Doug returns, he is shocked to find boys from every walk of life interested in dating Katie. When his obsession with Katie and her boyfriends reaches extreme limits, Janet suggests that Doug needs [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] help and he seeks out an expert who gives him advice that goes wrong whenever it is applied. Through the latter half of the film, Katie has three boyfriends, two of whom she eventually stops dating. At the film's ending, Katie takes a class trip to Europe and reunites with Richard again \u2013 at which point Bonnie, her younger tomboy sister, begins her own dating spree. Doug also finds out the \"expert\" was anything but, as he never had a daughter himself.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Tony Danza]] as Doug Simpson\n* [[Ami Dolenz]] as Katie Simpson\n* Laura Mooney as Bonnie Simpson\n* [[Catherine Hicks]] as Janet Pearson\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Dr. Fishbinder\n* [[Derek McGrath]] as Jeff Robbins\n* Lance Wilson-White as Richard\n* [[Dana Ashbrook]] as Joey\n* [[Matthew Perry]] as Timothy (credited as Matthew L.

What assumptions do they have about the purpose and quality of life? I ask because ''She's Out of Control'' is simultaneously so bizarre and so banal that it's a first: the first movie fabricated entirely from sitcom cliches and plastic lifestyles, without reference to any known plane of reality.</blockquote>\n\nChicago film critic [[Gene Siskel]] also gave the film zero stars, calling it \"a lame comedy that barely resembles a real movie.\"<ref>[[Gene Siskel|Siskel, Gene]] (April 14, 1989). \"Siskel's Flicks Picks\".
