To escape his difficult home life&mdash;his father [[verbal abuse|verbally]] and [[physical abuse|physically abuses]] him and his mother&mdash;he spends his days rehearsing and his nights performing at the [[First Avenue (nightclub)|First Avenue nightclub]]. The Revolution, the flashy [[Morris Day]] and his group [[The Time (band)|The Time]], and [[Dez Dickerson]] and his group The Modernaires hold the nightclub's three [[house band]] slots. Morris, aware that The Revolution's guitarist Wendy and keyboardist Lisa are frustrated that The Kid is unwilling to play their compositions, lobbies Billy Sparks, the club's owner, to replace The Revolution with a [[girl group]] which Morris is already forming. \n\nHe targets the Kid's girlfriend Apollonia\u2014an aspiring singer and new arrival in Minneapolis\u2014to lead his group, and tries to persuade her that The Kid is too self-centered to help her. She eventually joins Morris's group, which Morris names [[Apollonia 6]]. When she reveals her newfound partnership to the Kid, he becomes furious and slaps her, as his father had struck him earlier.\n\nAt the club, The Kid responds to the internal band strife, the pressure to draw more crowds, and his strained private life with the uncomfortably personal \"[[Darling Nikki]]\". His performance publicly humiliates Apollonia, who runs off in tears, and angers both Morris and Billy, worsening his situation. Billy confronts the Kid, castigating him for bringing his personal life onto the stage and warning him that he is wasting his musical talent as his father did. Apollonia 6 successfully debuts, and Billy warns the Kid that his First Avenue slot is at risk. \n\nThe Kid seizes Apollonia from a drunken Morris and the two argue and fight; Apollonia then abandons him. Returning home, he finds the house in tatters, with his mother nowhere to be found. When he turns on the basement light, his father\u2014who had been lurking in the basement with a loaded handgun\u2014shoots himself in the head. Frenzied after a night of torment, the Kid tears apart the basement to release his frustration, only to find a large box of his father's musical compositions. The next morning, the Kid picks up a [[cassette tape]] of one of Wendy and Lisa's compositions, a rhythm track named \"Slow Groove\", and begins to compose.\n\nThat night at First Avenue, all is quiet in The Revolution's dressing room until The Time stops by to taunt the Kid about his family life. Once on stage, the Kid announces that he will be playing \"a song the girls in the band wrote\", dedicated to his father\u2014revealed to be \"[[Purple Rain (song)|Purple Rain]]\". As the emotional song ends, the Kid rushes from the stage and out the back door of the club, intending to ride away on his motorcycle. However, before he can mount it, he realizes that his new song has thrilled the crowd. \n\nThe Kid returns to the club, with his fellow musicians greeting him with approval and a teary-eyed Apollonia embracing him. The Kid returns to the stage for [[I Would Die 4 U|two]] [[Baby I'm a Star|encores]] with The Revolution, to the wild approval of the crowd (even Morris); overlaid scenes show the Kid visiting his father and mother in the hospital and sorting his father's compositions in the basement, accompanied by Apollonia.

Some of these scenes include Prince and Apollonia having sex in a barn (a concept which was the story behind the 1985 song \"[[Raspberry Beret]]\"); Prince going to Apollonia 6's rehearsal and physically fighting with the members of The Time; and a scene which featured Prince's mother talking to him about her shaky relationship with his father. In addition, many scenes such as the \"Lake Minnetonka\" scene, Apollonia first meeting Morris, and the railyard scene were cut down because of time constraints. Many clips from these scenes were featured, however, in the trailer for the movie as well as the \"When Doves Cry\" and \"Let's Go Crazy\" montage.
