[[Bureau of Prohibition]] agent [[Eliot Ness]] has been tasked with halting Capone's activities, but his first attempt at a liquor raid fails due to corrupt policemen alerting Capone. He then encounters veteran [[Irish American|Irish-American]] officer Jimmy Malone, who opposes the rampant corruption and offers to help Ness, suggesting they find a man from the police academy who has not yet come under Capone's influence and still believes in the idealistic aspects of law enforcement. They recruit [[Italian American|Italian-American]] trainee George Stone (birth name Giuseppe Petri) for his superior marksmanship and integrity. Joined by accountant Oscar Wallace, assigned to Ness from [[Washington, D.C.]], they successfully raid a Capone liquor warehouse and start to gain positive publicity, with the press dubbing them \"The Untouchables.\" Capone later kills the man responsible for managing the warehouse with a [[baseball bat]] as a warning to his other subordinates. \n\nDiscovering that Capone has not filed an [[income tax]] return for four years, Wallace suggests trying to build a [[tax evasion]] case against him (as Capone's network keeps him well-insulated from his other crimes). A crooked [[alderman]] offers Ness a bribe to drop his investigation, but Ness refuses. After Capone's enforcer [[Frank Nitti]] threatens to kill Ness's wife Catherine and their daughter, Ness immediately moves them to a safe house. In a subsequent raid on the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canadian border]], Ness and his team intercept an incoming liquor shipment, killing several gangsters and capturing a Capone [[bookkeeper]] named George, whom they eventually persuade to testify against his boss. Back in Chicago, Nitti, dressed as a policeman, murders Wallace and George in a police station and leaves a taunting message for Ness. Ness confronts Capone at the [[Lexington Hotel]] after the murders, but Malone intervenes, urging Ness to focus on persuading the [[district attorney]] not to dismiss the charges against Capone.\n\nRealizing that police chief Mike Dorsett sold out Wallace and George, Malone forces Dorsett to reveal where Capone's accountant, Walter Payne, is hiding. That evening, one of Capone's men breaks into Malone's apartment; Malone chases him out with a shotgun, but Nitti ambushes him with a [[Thompson submachine gun|Tommy gun]]. Shortly afterwards, Ness and Stone arrive to find Malone mortally wounded; before he dies, Malone shows them which train Payne will take out of town. As the duo await Payne's arrival at [[Union Station (Chicago)|Union Station]], Ness sees a young mother with two suitcases and a child in a carriage laboriously climbing the lobby steps. Ness ultimately decides to assist her, but the gangsters guarding Payne appear as Ness and the woman reach the top of the stairs, and a bloody shootout occurs. Though outnumbered, Ness and Stone manage to capture Payne alive and kill all his escorts, keeping both mother and child unharmed.\n\nLater, when Payne testifies at Capone's trial, Ness observes that Capone appears strangely calm, and that Nitti is wearing a gun in the courtroom. The [[bailiff]] removes Nitti and searches him, finding a note from Chicago Mayor [[William Hale Thompson]] which effectively permits him to carry the weapon. However, noticing Nitti possesses a [[matchbook]] with Malone's address written inside, Ness realizes that Nitti killed Malone. Panicked, Nitti shoots the bailiff before fleeing to the courthouse roof, where Ness captures him. After Nitti insults the memory of Malone and gloats that he will never be convicted for the murder, an enraged Ness pushes Nitti off the roof to his death, avenging Wallace and Malone.\n\nStone gives Ness a list, taken from Nitti's coat, which shows that the jurors in the trial are all on Capone's payroll. Behind closed doors, Ness persuades the judge to switch Capone's jury with one hearing an unrelated divorce case. This prompts Capone's lawyer to enter a guilty plea, although an outraged Capone violently objects. Capone is later convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to eleven years in prison. On the day Capone begins serving his sentence, Ness closes up his office, giving Malone's [[St. Jude]] medallion and callbox key to Stone as a farewell present. As Ness leaves the police station, a reporter mentions the probable repeal of Prohibition, asking Ness what he will do in that case. Ness replies, \"I think I'll have a drink.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as [[Eliot Ness]]\n* [[Sean Connery]] as Jim Malone\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as [[Al Capone]]\n* [[Charles Martin Smith]] as Oscar Wallace\n* [[Andy Garc\u00eda]] as George Stone\n* [[Billy Drago]] as [[Frank Nitti]]\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as Catherine Ness, Eliot's wife \n* [[Richard Bradford (actor)|Richard Bradford]] as Mike Dorsett\n* [[Jack Kehoe]] as Walter Payne\n* [[Brad Sullivan]] as George\n}}\n\n==Background==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[Ned Tanen]] spent years trying to obtain the rights to [[Eliot Ness]]'s life story while working as an executive at [[Universal Pictures]] in the 1970s and the 1980s. After becoming head of motion picture productions at [[Paramount Pictures]], which owned the film and television rights to Ness's memoir ''[[The Untouchables (1957 book)|The Untouchables]]'', Tanen immediately hired [[Art Linson]] to begin producing a film adaptation. Linson was not interested in adapting the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|television series based on Ness's book]], and sought to create a more \"serious, authentic\" depiction of Ness's career in Chicago. Linson hired playwright [[David Mamet]] to compose an original script for the film. Most of Mamet's screenplay was used, but director Brian De Palma slightly rewrote some scenes during production in order to incorporate new locations. For instance, the scene paying homage to the [[Potemkin Stairs]] from ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1925) was moved from a hospital to [[Chicago Union Station]].<ref name=\":0\" /> A month after the film was released, De Palma downplayed his own role on the script:\n\n<blockquote>Being a writer myself, I don't like to take credit for things I didn't do. I didn't develop this script. David [Mamet] used some of my ideas and he didn't use some of them. I looked upon it more clinically, as a piece of material that has to be shaped, with certain scenes here or there. But as for the moral dimension, that's more or less the conception of the script, and I just implemented it with my skills \u2013 which are well developed. It's good to walk in somebody else's shoes for a while. You get out of your own obsessions; you are in the service of somebody else's vision, and that's a great discipline for a director.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bennetts |first=Leslie |date=July 6, 1987 |title=''The Untouchables'': De Palma's Departure |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/06/movies/the-untouchables-de-palma-s-departure.html?pagewanted=all |url-status=live |access-date=2010-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512093940/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/06/movies/the-untouchables-de-palma-s-departure.html?pagewanted=all |archive-date=2013-05-12}}</ref></blockquote>Linson and De Palma wanted to have more tender portrayal of Ness than [[Robert Stack]]'s \"tough\" portrayal from the 1950s television series, seeking to portray him as a \"vulnerable family man.\" De Palma initially wanted [[Don Johnson]] to portray Eliot Ness.
