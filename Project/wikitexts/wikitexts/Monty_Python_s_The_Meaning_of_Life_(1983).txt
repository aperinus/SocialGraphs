''The Meaning of Life'' was the last feature film to star all six Python members before the death of [[Graham Chapman]] in 1989.\n\nUnlike ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail|Holy Grail]]'' and ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'', the film's two predecessors, which each told a single, more-or-less coherent story,<ref name=\"guard2013\"/> ''The Meaning of Life'' returned to the sketch format of the troupe's [[Monty Python's Flying Circus|original television series]] and their first film from twelve years earlier, ''[[And Now for Something Completely Different]]'', loosely structured as a series of comic sketches about the various stages of life. It was accompanied by the [[short film]] ''[[The Crimson Permanent Assurance]]''.\n\nReleased on 23 June 1983 in the United Kingdom,<ref>McCall, Douglas (12 November 2013).

It was screened at the [[1983 Cannes Film Festival]], where it won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]]. The film appears in a 2010 list of the top 20 [[cult film]]s published by ''The Boston Globe''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/gallery/top_cult_films?pg=2 |title=Top 20 cult films, according to our readers |author=Boston.com Staff |publisher=The Boston Globe |work=boston.com |access-date=1 February 2016 |date=27 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSix fish in a restaurant's [[fish tank|tank]] greet each other, then see their friend being eaten. This leads them to question the [[meaning of life]]. In the first sketch, \"The Miracle of Birth\", maternity doctors ignore a woman in labour while trying to impress the hospital's administrator. In [[Yorkshire]], a [[Catholic Church in the United Kingdom|Roman Catholic]] man loses his job and informs his numerous children that he must sell them for scientific experiments (\"[[Every Sperm Is Sacred]]\"). A [[Protestantism in the United Kingdom|Protestant]] man looks on disapprovingly and proudly remarks that Protestants can use contraception and have sex for pleasure (though his wife points out that they never do).\n\nIn \"Growth and Learning\", a class of boys learn school etiquette before partaking in a [[sex education]] lesson, which involves watching their teacher have sex with his wife. One boy laughs and is forced into a violent [[rugby football|rugby]] match pitting pupils against the school masters as punishment. \"Fighting Each Other\" features three scenes concerning the British military. First, during the [[Battle of Verdun]] in [[World War I]], a British officer tries to rally his men during an attack, but they instead present him with going-away gifts. Second, a modern army [[Regimental sergeant major|RSM]] bullies his soldiers to say what they'd rather be doing than drill practice, then dismisses each in turn. Lastly, in 1879 during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]], a soldier finds his leg has been bitten off. Suspecting a [[tiger]], the soldiers hunt for it and find men wearing two halves of a tiger costume.\n\nAn announcer introduces \"The Middle of the Film,\" during which bizarre characters challenge the audience in a segment called \"Find the Fish.\" \"Middle Age\" involves an American couple visiting a [[Cuisine of Hawaii|Hawaiian]] restaurant with a [[Medieval]] [[torture]] theme, where, to the interest of the fish, the waiter offers a conversation about philosophy and the meaning of life. The customers are unable to make sense of it and move on to a discussion of live organ transplants. In \"Live Organ Transplants\", two [[paramedic]]s visit a card-carrying [[organ donor]] and remove his [[liver]] while he is alive. His wife is reluctant to donate her liver, but she relents after a man steps out of a refrigerator and reminds her of humanity's insignificance in the universe (\"[[Galaxy Song]]\"). Executives of an American conglomerate debate the meaning of life before a raid by [[The Crimson Permanent Assurance]] briefly interrupts them.\n\n\"The Autumn Years\" starts off with a musician in a French restaurant singing about the joys of having a [[penis]] (\"The Not [[No\u00ebl Coward]] Song\"). As the song ends, the ill-tempered glutton [[Mr. Creosote]] enters the restaurant, causing the fish to scatter and hide. He vomits continuously and devours an enormous meal. After the [[ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel]] persuades him to eat an after-dinner mint, Creosote's gut explodes, splattering the other diners. In \"The Meaning of Life\", the restaurant's cleaning woman proposes that life is meaningless before revealing that she is a racist. A waiter leads the audience to the house where he was born, recalls his mother's lessons about kindness, and then becomes angry when his point trails off.\n\n\"Death\" features a condemned man choosing the manner of his own execution: being chased off the [[Cliffs of Dover]] by topless women in sports gear and falling into his own grave below. In a short animated sequence, despondent leaves commit suicide by throwing themselves from the branches of a tree. The [[Grim Reaper]] enters an isolated home and convinces the hosts and dinner guests, with difficulty, that they are all dead. They accompany the Grim Reaper to [[Heaven]], revealed to be the Hawaiian restaurant from earlier. They enter a [[Las Vegas]]-style hotel where it's always [[Christmas]] and meet the characters from the previous sketches (\"Christmas in Heaven\").\n\nThe song ends abruptly for \"The End of the Film\". The host from \"The Middle of the Film\" opens an envelope and blandly reveals the meaning of life: \"Try and be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try and live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations\".\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Main cast (the top 5) and featured cast (the 7 shown in same size font as the Pythons) is in credits order, with names as credited.

An awful lot of material didn't get used. ''Holy Grail'' had a structure, a loose one: the search for the grail. Same with ''Life of Brian''. With this, it wasn't so clear. In the end, we just said: 'Well, what the heck. We have got lots of good material, let's give it the loosest structure, which will be the meaning of life'\".<ref name=\"guard2013\" />\n\nAfter the film's title was chosen, [[Douglas Adams]] called Jones to tell him he had just finished a new book, to be called ''[[The Meaning of Liff]]''; Jones was initially concerned about the similarity in titles, which led to the scene in the [[title sequence]] of a tombstone which, when hit by a flash of lightning, changes from \"The Meaning of Liff\" to \"The Meaning of Life\".<ref name=\"guard2013\" />\n\n[[File:Cartwright Hall and fountain, Bradford (22nd October 2010).jpg|thumb|right|The grounds of Cartwright Hall in [[Bradford]] ''(pictured)'' was used as a location for the dancing nurses singing \"[[Every Sperm Is Sacred]]\"]]\nPrincipal photography began on 12 July 1982 and was completed about two months later, on 11 September. A wide variety of locations were used, such as [[Porchester Hall]] in [[Queensway, London|Queensway]] for the Mr Creosote sketch, where hundreds of pounds of fake vomit had to be cleaned up on the last day due to a wedding being scheduled hours later. The Malham Moors were chosen for the Grim Reaper segment; the countryside near [[Strathblane]] was used for the Zulu War; and \"Every Sperm Is Sacred\" was shot in [[Colne]], [[Lancashire]], with interiors done at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Douglas |first1=McCall |title=Monty Python: A Chronology, 1969-2012, 2d ed. |date=2013 |publisher=McFarland |page=958}}</ref>\n\nThe film was produced on a budget of less than US$10 million, which was still bigger than that of the earlier films. This allowed for large-scale choreography and crowd sequences, a more lavishly produced soundtrack that included new original songs, and much more time able to be spent on each sketch, especially ''The Crimson Permanent Assurance''. Palin later said that the larger budget, and not making the film for the [[BBC]] (i.e., television), allowed the film to be more daring and dark.<ref name=\"guard2013\" />\n\nThe idea for the hospital sketch came from Chapman, himself a doctor,<ref name=split>{{cite web|url=http://splitsider.com/2013/09/dick-cavetts-semi-serious-talk-with-graham-chapman/|title=Dick Cavett's Semi-Serious Talk with Graham Chapman|last=Ess|first=Ramsey|date=20 September 2013|work=Splitsider|publisher=[[The Awl]]|access-date=21 September 2015}}</ref> who had noticed that hospitals were changing, with \"lots and lots of machinery\".<ref name=\"guard2013\" /> According to Palin, the organ transplant scene harked back to Python's love of bureaucracy, and sketches with lots of people coming round from the council with different bits of paper.<ref name=\"guard2013\" />\n\nDuring the filming of the scene where Palin's character explains Catholicism to his children, his line was \"that rubber thing at the end of my ''sock''\", which was later overdubbed with ''cock''.<ref name=\"guard2013\" />\n\n===''The Crimson Permanent Assurance''===\n{{main|The Crimson Permanent Assurance}}\nThe [[short film]] ''[[The Crimson Permanent Assurance]]'' introduces the feature.

One of the boardrooms raided reappears later in the film, from shortly before the attack begins until the narrator apologises and a skyscraper falls and crushes the marauders.\n\nThe short was intended as an [[animation|animated]] sequence in the feature,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hunter |first1=I.
