The film was released in the United States on December 22, 1995. Set at the [[Pittsburgh Civic Arena]], the film was written by [[Gene Quintano]], based on a story by Karen Elise Baldwin, the wife of then-[[Pittsburgh Penguins]] owner [[Howard Baldwin]], who was a co-producer. It was the second collaboration between Van Damme and Hyams, after ''[[Timecop]]'' (1994).\n\nThe film grossed $64 million at the box office on a $35 million budget and received mixed reviews at the time of its release,<ref name=\"latimes-exhale\">{{cite news |title= It's a Big Sigh of Relief for 'Exhale'; Box office: Whitney Houston film opens strongly and could take in $11 million or more for the four-day weekend.

During the 1995 [[Stanley Cup Finals]] between the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] and the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] (a fictional rematch of the [[1992 Stanley Cup Finals]]), a group of terrorists take the [[Vice President of the United States]] and several other VIPs hostage in a luxury suite. [[Secret service|Secret Service]] operative Joshua Foss has the arena wired with explosives, and plans to blow it up at the end of the game, while having hundreds of millions of dollars wired into several off shore accounts.\n\nDarren takes his son Tyler and daughter Emily to Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals as a birthday gift for Tyler. A spat between brother and sister causes Emily to run off before getting kidnapped by Carla, the sole female member of the terrorists (who is disguised as the local mascot [[List of NHL mascots#Iceburgh|Iceburgh]] after killing the original performer). Carla places Emily in the suite with the other hostages about to be executed. Not wanting his son to go missing, Darren orders Tyler to stay in his seat while he goes searching for Emily. Carla is about to kill Darren, but he evades her attacks in a fight and kills her. Afterward, Darren asks for a security guard's help, but the guard is another terrorist in disguise and reveals their criminal operation before being killed by Darren. Now aware of the situation, Darren finds a mobile phone in the executive offices and uses it to contact [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] Agent Matthew Hallmark; Hallmark advises Darren to stand by while the agents take charge. He angrily refuses, saying that he will handle this himself.\n\nThe Secret Service and the [[Pittsburgh Police|Pittsburgh Bureau of Police]] team up to surround the arena and a standoff ensues. Meanwhile, Darren manages to find and disarm a few of the bombs (as well as killing and evading a few of Foss' men), whilst Foss himself kills several hostages after the end of the first and second periods. Hallmark finally makes his way inside and meets Darren, who explains where the rest of the bombs are most likely located. Hallmark is revealed to be in league with Foss, and tries to kidnap Tyler, but fails. Hallmark then reveals his true self to Darren, who sets him on fire and ultimately kills him. Darren then uses Hallmark's phone to contact Foss, who taunts that he is holding his daughter captive.\n\nAs time ticks down, Darren disables more bombs, but is severely slowed by confrontations with Foss' men. At one point, Darren, dressed as the Pittsburgh goalie to escape the thugs, enters the game and successfully defends a shot on goal. As the third period runs down, [[Luc Robitaille]] scores the game-tying goal for Pittsburgh in the last second, prompting [[Sudden death (sport)#Ice hockey|sudden death overtime]] and prolonging the game. Deciding that there's no time left to find the remaining bombs, Darren climbs to the roof of the arena. He fights off two of Foss' henchmen; one of them falls onto the score display, blowing it up. As the arena erupts into chaos, Darren advances upon the owner's box from above and forces his way in, rescuing Emily, the Vice President and the remaining hostages. Darren and Emily reunite with Tyler and set out to leave the arena.\n\nFoss manages to escape and blend in with the panicking crowd. He sets off one of the bombs, flooding part of the arena, and recaptures Emily when she recognizes him. They head towards the top of the arena, where a helicopter is waiting to lift Foss away. Darren intervenes and saves his daughter before Foss could shoot her. As Foss attempts to flee, Darren shoots the pilot, causing the chopper to stall and fall into the arena, sending a screaming Foss to his death as the chopper explodes on impact with the ice.\n\nDarren is led to an awaiting Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS [[ambulance|medic unit]] while his children tell the paramedics of his heroism. As a contented Darren is loaded into the ambulance, it is presumed that he was restored back to his position.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] as Chief Darren Francis Thomas McCord, a former Pittsburgh [[firefighter]] who now works as a fire marshal at the [[Pittsburgh Civic Arena]]\n* [[Powers Boothe]] as Joshua Foss, a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent and mastermind of the terrorists\n* [[Raymond J.
