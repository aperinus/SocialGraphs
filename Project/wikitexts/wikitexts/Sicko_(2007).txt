Investigating [[health care in the United States]], it focuses on the country's [[health insurance]] and the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. The film compares the for-profit non-universal U.S. system with the non-profit [[universal health care]] systems of [[Canadian and American health care systems compared|Canada]], the [[National Health Service|United Kingdom]], [[France#Public health|France]] and [[Healthcare in Cuba|Cuba]].\n\nProduced on a roughly $9 million budget,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/20/movies/20sick.html|title=Some Cities Will Get Early Look at 'Sicko'|date=June 20, 2007|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> ''Sicko'' grossed $25 million theatrically in North America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=sicko.htm|title=Sicko (2007) - Box Office Mojo|website=www.boxofficemojo.com}}</ref> This exceeded the official expectation of [[The Weinstein Company]], which had hoped to be in line with ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]''{{'}}s $22 million U.S. box office gross.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117966667.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title=TWC, Moore stand behind 'Sicko'|author=Dade Hayes|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n''Sicko'' begins by noting that almost 50 million Americans were uninsured in 2007 while the remainder, who are covered, are often victims of [[Corporate fraud|insurance company fraud]] and [[red tape]]. ''Sicko'' mentions that the [[World Health Organization]] ranks U.S. health in general as 37 out of 191 countries and ranks some U.S. health measures, such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]], as equal to countries with much less economic wealth.<ref>World Health Organization ranking of health systems</ref> Interviews are conducted with people who thought they had adequate coverage but were denied care. Former employees of insurance companies describe cost-cutting initiatives that give bonuses to insurance company physicians and others to find reasons for the company to avoid meeting the cost of medically necessary treatments for policy holders, and thus increase company profitability.\n\nThe history of the American health care debate serves as a backdrop. Opponents of universal health care are set in the context of 1950s-style [[anti-communist]] propaganda. A 1950s [[Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine|record]] distributed by the [[American Medical Association]], narrated by corporate spokesmodel [[Ronald Reagan]], warns that [[universal health care]] could lead to lost freedoms and [[socialism]]. In response, Moore shows that socialized public services like [[Law enforcement in the United States|police]], [[Firefighting in the United States|fire service]], the [[United States Postal Service]], [[Public education in the United States|public education]] and [[Public libraries in North America|community libraries]] have not led to communism in the United States.\n\n===Canada===\nIn Canada, a citizen describes the case of [[Tommy Douglas]], who was voted the [[greatest Canadian]] in 2004 for his contributions to the [[Health care in Canada|Canadian health system]]. Moore also interviews a [[Microsurgery|microsurgeon]] and people waiting in the emergency room of a Canadian public hospital.\n\n===HMO origin in the 1970s===\nThe origins of the [[Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973]] are presented using a taped conversation between [[John Ehrlichman]] and President [[Richard Nixon]] on February 17, 1971; Ehrlichman is heard telling Nixon that \"the less care they give them, the more money they make\", a plan that Nixon remarked was \"fine\" and \"not bad\". This led to the expansion of the modern [[health maintenance organization]]-based health care system. Connections are highlighted between [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] (PhRMA), the lobbying arm of the largest drug companies in the United States, lobbying groups in Washington D.C., and the [[United States Congress|Congress]]. [[Hillary Clinton]], a champion of the [[Clinton health care plan]], is shown as a crusader for change, appointed to reform the health care system in the United States by her husband, newly elected President Bill Clinton. Her efforts are met with heavy-handed criticisms by Republicans on Capitol Hill, and right-wing media throughout the country, who characterize her plan as the harbinger of socialism. When she is defeated, her punishment is to \"never speak of it again while in the White House.\" Seven years later, her silence is [[bribery|rewarded]], as she becomes a Senator via healthcare industry contributions, the second largest recipient in the Senate.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the United Kingdom, a country whose [[National Health Service]] is a comprehensive [[publicly funded health care]] system, Moore interviews patients and inquires about in-hospital expenses incurred by patients, only to be told that there are no out-of-pocket payments. Moore visits a typical UK pharmacy, where pharmaceuticals are free of charge for all persons in [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] and under 16, 16\u201317 in full-time education, disabled, unemployed, or over 60 in [[England]], and subsidized in most cases for everyone else (in England); only a fixed amount of \u00a36.65 (about $10) per item on a prescription was charged, irrespective of cost to the NHS. Further, NHS hospitals employ a cashier, part of whose job is to reimburse low-income patients for their out-of-pocket travel costs to the hospital. Interviews include an NHS [[general practitioner]], an American woman residing in London, and British politician [[Tony Benn]], who compares a hypothetical dismantling of the NHS to ending [[women's suffrage]] and says it would lead to a revolution.\n\n===France===\nIn France, Moore visits a hospital and interviews the head of [[obstetrics and gynaecology]] and a group of American [[expatriate]]s. Moore rides with the \"[[SOS M\u00e9decins]]\", a 24-hour French medical service that provides [[house call]]s by physicians.<ref name=jcohn>{{cite news |last=Cohn |first=Jonathan |author-link1=Jonathan Cohn |title=Shticko; It's no fun to agree with Michael Moore |work=[[The New Republic]] |date=July 2, 2007 |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/62883/shticko-its-no-fun-agree-michael-moorehttp://www.tnr.com/print/article/shticko-its-no-fun-agree-michael-moore |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517150812/https://newrepublic.com/article/62883/shticko-its-no-fun-agree-michael-moore |archive-date=May 17, 2017 |url-status=unfit}}<!-- previous url was http://www.tnr.com/print/article/shticko-its-no-fun-agree-michael-moore --></ref> Moore discovers that the French government provides many social services and rights in addition to [[Health care in France|health care]], such as [[Child care|daycare]] for $1 an hour, free college education, a minimum five weeks paid vacation by law, vacation, and neonatal support that includes cooking, cleaning, and laundry services for new mothers.\n\n===Return to US===\nReturning to the United States, interviews disclose that [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] rescue workers who volunteered [[Rescue and recovery effort after the September 11, 2001 attacks|after the September 11, 2001 attacks]] were denied government funds to care for [[Health effects arising from the September 11, 2001 attacks|physical and psychological illnesses]] they subsequently developed, including respiratory disease and [[PTSD]]-induced [[bruxism]]. Unable to receive and afford medical care in the United States, the 9/11 rescue workers, as well as all of Moore's friends in the film needing medical attention, set sail from [[Miami]] to Cuba on three speedboats in order to obtain free medical care provided for the detainees at the U.S. [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp]].\n\n===Cuba===\nThe group arrives at the entrance channel to \"Gitmo\" and Moore uses a megaphone to request access, pleading for the 9/11 victims to receive treatment that is on par with the medical attention the detainees are receiving. The attempt ceases when a siren is blown from the base, and the group moves on to [[Havana]], where they purchase inexpensive medicine and receive free medical treatment at the elite [[Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital]].<ref name=\"inthenews\">{{cite news\n |title       = Moore unveils Sicko at Cannes\n |publisher   = InTheNews.co.uk\n |date        = May 14, 2007\n |url         = http://www.inthenews.co.uk/entertainment/film/moore-unveils-sicko-at-cannes-$1086968.htm\n |access-date  = May 23, 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070603170813/http://www.inthenews.co.uk/entertainment/film/moore-unveils-sicko-at-cannes-$1086968.htm\n |archive-date = June 3, 2007\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref> Providing only their names and birth dates, the rescue workers are hospitalized and receive medical attention. Before they leave, the 9/11 rescue workers are honored by a local Havana fire station.\n\nFinally, Moore addresses the audience, emphasizing that people should be \"taking care of each other, no matter the differences.\" To demonstrate his personal commitment to this theme, Moore decides to help one of his biggest critics, Jim Kenefick. According to a blog posting, Kenefick feared he would have to shut down his anti-Moore website because he needed US$12,000 to cover the costs of medical treatment for his sick wife. Not wanting the U.S. health care system to limit Kenefick's ability to express his opinion, Moore sends Kenefick the money himself.\n\nThis film ends with Moore walking towards the [[United States Capitol]] with a basket full of his clothes, sarcastically saying he will get the government to do his laundry until a better day comes for the sick and hopeless who are unable to receive health care.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Billy Tauzin]] as himself\n*[[:fr:Jacques Milliez|Jacques Milliez]] as himself\n\n==Laws discussed==\n*[[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]] of 2003\n\n==Release==\n''Sicko'' premiered on May 19, 2007, at the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival]], receiving a 17-minute [[standing ovation]]<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = Sicko: Secrets de tournage\n  | work=[[AlloCin\u00e9]]\n  | url = http://www.allocine.fr/film/anecdote_gen_cfilm=54503.html\n  | access-date = October 2, 2007\n}}</ref> from 2,000 people at the Grand Theatre Lumiere.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/story/2007/05/19/moore-cannes-sicko.html | title=Michael Moore's Sicko gets audience thumbs-up at Cannes | publisher=CBC | work=[[CBC Arts]] | access-date=May 21, 2007 | date=May 19, 2007}}</ref> The North American premi\u00e8re of ''Sicko'' was held in [[London, Ontario]] (where some scenes from the movie were filmed), at the [[Cineplex Entertainment|Silver City]] movie theatre at [[Masonville Place]] on June 8, 2007, with Moore in attendance.<ref>''Sicko'' features patients from the London, Ontario area.</ref> It also had an early premi\u00e8re in Washington DC. on June 20, two days before its U.S. release, with Moore appearing at a Capitol Hill press conference to promote the film.<ref name=\"WBJ1\">{{cite news\n  | last = Hoover\n  | first = Kent\n  | title = Michael Moore visits Capitol Hill to promote ''Sicko''\n  | series = Health Care&nbsp;\u2013 Health Insurance\n  |work=[[Washington Business Journal]]\n  | date=  June 20, 2007\n  | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2007/06/18/daily35.html\n  | access-date = October 2, 2007  }}</ref>\n\nThe European premi\u00e8re was held in Great Britain on October 24, 2007, at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] as part of the 51st [[London Film Festival]].

Potter explained, \"The industry has always tried to make Americans think that government-run systems are the worst thing that could possibly happen to them, that even if you consider that, you're heading down on the slippery slope towards socialism. So they have used scare tactics for years and years and years, to keep that from happening. If there were a broader program like our Medicare program now, it could potentially reduce the profits of these big companies. So that is their biggest concern.\"\n\nMoyers reported and Potter confirmed that there were attempts to radicalize Moore in an effort to discredit the film's message. Moore would be referred to as a \"Hollywood entertainer\" or \"Hollywood moviemaker\" to associate the film as being grounded in entertainment without any basis in objective reality. \"They would want you to see this as just some fantasy that a Hollywood filmmaker had come up with. That's part of the strategy.\" Potter said that the strategy worked and the impact of the film was \"blunted\" by the [[public relations]] campaign. He agreed that ''Sicko'' contained \"a great truth\" which he said was \"that we shouldn't fear government involvement in our health care system. That there is an appropriate role for government, and it's been proven in the countries that were in that movie. You know, we have more people who are uninsured in this country than the entire population of Canada. And that if you include the people who are underinsured, more people than in the United Kingdom.

According to an anonymous source reported by Reuters, Moore has not been served; rather, the government contacted his attorney, [[David Boies]], to discuss the logistics of serving a subpoena.<ref name=Reuters729>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/peopleNews/idUSN2725763420070727 | work=[[Reuters]] | title=U.S. officials may subpoena filmmaker Moore | access-date=July 29, 2007 | date=July 27, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Deleted scenes and extras==\nThe DVD release includes deleted segments that Moore filmed but did not use in the theatrical release. Several scenes from the section about health care in the United Kingdom feature footage of a homeless shelter where people received acupuncture and foot massages. Discarded scenes in France include an interview with an employee from [[General Electric]], who tells Moore they get benefits in France that GE employees do not receive in the United States.<ref name=\"metroactive.com\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.metroactive.com/metro/06.27.07/michael-moore-0726.html\n| access-date = August 25, 2007\n| date=  2007-06-27\n| title = Moore in Motion\n| work = [[Metro Silicon Valley|Metroactive]]\n}}</ref> Scenes showing Moore's visit to [[Norway]] and depicting its healthcare system, social benefits, and rehabilitation-based prison system were removed from the film because the Norwegian healthcare system, which is supervised by the [[Norwegian Board of Health Supervision]], possesses numerous benefits similar to the French system. Like the French health care system, Norwegian patients treated for illnesses such as [[psoriasis]] or [[rheumatism]] are shown eligible for two weeks' paid vacation at a spa in the [[Canary Islands]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.grand-canary.com/asthma-allergy-health.htm\n| title = Test apartment on the Canary Islands in cases of asthma, allergies, fatigue and health problems\n| access-date = August 25, 2007\n}}</ref> Norway hires a government [[ethicist]] to determine how to invest the windfall from the country's oil wealth, because they want to do it in an ethical manner.<ref name=\"metroactive.com\"/> A scene where Moore visits [[Bast\u00f8y Prison]], a Norwegian island prison, was also deleted. Here, inmates reside in small group homes and focus on rehabilitation through manual labor and farming.<ref>{{YouTube|01mTKDaKa6Q|Michael Moore Goes to Norway & Visits a Prison of the Future}}. Retrieved 10 May 2013.</ref>\n\nDeleted American health care scenes include an uninsured woman who was offered a 50% discount for treatment of spinal cancer. She still could not afford the initial consultations, so she held a [[fundraiser]] to pay for it. After the initial visit, the 50 percent discount was revoked when the hospital discovered that she had obtained the money to pay for her treatment through fundraising, which the hospital considered to be earned income. An interview with [[Marcia Angell]] was also deleted. The former editor of ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' criticizes various practices of pharmaceutical companies and the [[Food and Drug Administration]]. Executive producer [[Harvey Weinstein]] asked Moore to remove a scene critical of Hillary Clinton, but Moore refused. Weinstein, whose company provided financing for the film, is a friend of the Clinton family.<ref name=\"WP_Akers\">{{cite news\n  | last = Akers\n  | first =  Mary Ann\n  | title = Moore Says Weinstein Wanted Clinton Scene Cut\n  | page = A05\n  | series = Politics\n  |work=[[The Washington Post]]\n  | date=  June 22, 2007\n  | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/21/AR2007062102150.html\n  | access-date = October 2, 2007\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.michaelmoore.com/sicko/dvd/extras.html\n |access-date  = November 2, 2007\n |date        = November 2, 2007\n |title       = View clips from the DVD extras\n |publisher   = Michael Moore\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071104071442/http://www.michaelmoore.com/sicko/dvd/extras.html\n |archive-date = November 4, 2007\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the DVD edition of the film, Moore added a segment called \"''Sicko'' Goes to Washington\".
