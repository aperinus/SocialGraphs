He is the only profiled character in the documentary who has succumbed to watching films on video, of which he seems to own thousands (the others steadfastly refuse to watch TV under any circumstances; Roberta Hill states that she \"only has nightmares in video.\")\n*Harvey Schwartz \u2014 A cinephile who has traits found among those with [[Asperger syndrome]],<ref>[http://www.tasteofcinema.com/2016/the-10-best-movies-about-cinephiles/2/ The 10 Best Movies About Cinephiles \u2014 Page 2 \u2014 Taste of Cinema]</ref> who lives on disability benefits. According to Jack, Harvey has no discerning taste in film and will watch just about anything, including ''[[Attack of the Crab Monsters|The Amazing Crab Monster]]''. He can quote the exact running time of every film he's ever seen from memory. He owns hundreds of soundtrack LPs but doesn't have a turntable.\n*Bill Heidbreder \u2014 A cinephile who defines his taste in film as \"effeminate\", as he prefers \"relationship\" films to action films. He is an NYU grad student and amateur philosopher who lives on unemployment benefits.\n*Jack Angstreich \u2014 The most heavily profiled member of the quintet, Jack's justification for his abnormal behavior is to not deny what he considers to be a \"visionary\" lifestyle, that there is no \"correct\" way to live, and really has no interest in real life beyond the cinema. He claims that he wouldn't want to make love to [[Rita Hayworth]] unless he was doing it in black-and-white. Living off an inheritance, Jack sees upwards of five films per day (and claims to have seen over 1,000 films in eight months at one point), and deliberately eats a constipating diet so he won't be interrupted while watching a film and have to go to the bathroom.\n\n==Roberta Hill==\n{{Infobox person\n| name = Roberta Hill\n| image = \n| image_size   = \n| caption     = \n| birth_date   = {{birth date|1936|6|18|mf=y}}\n| birth_place   = [[Washington, DC]], U.S.A.\n| death_date   = {{death date and age|mf=yes|2009|7|18|1936|6|18}}\n| death_place   = [[New York City]], U.S.A.\n| spouse     =\n| domesticpartner =\n}}\nHill was born June 18, 1936, in [[Washington, D.C.]], a daughter of Robert L. and Dorothy (n\u00e9e Dyar) Hill, and a granddaughter of [[Harrison Gray Dyar Jr.]]<ref name=\"SIA\">{{cite web|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217738?back=%2Fcollections%2Fsearch%3Ffacets%3DOH_Ent%26page%3D1%26perpage%3D10%26sort%3Drelevancy%26view%3Dlist |title=Dyar Family Oral History Interviews, 1993, 1999|work=Smithsonian Institution Archives Local Number: SIA RU009570|accessdate= 23 November 2011}}</ref> She lived for most of her life in Washington, D.C., moving in 1983 to [[New York City]], where she died on July 18, 2009.
