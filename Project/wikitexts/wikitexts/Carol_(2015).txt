The screenplay by [[Phyllis Nagy]] is based on the 1952 romance novel ''[[The Price of Salt]]'' by [[Patricia Highsmith]] (republished as ''Carol'' in 1990). The film stars [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Rooney Mara]], [[Sarah Paulson]], [[Jake Lacy]], and [[Kyle Chandler]]. Set in [[New York City]] during the early 1950s, ''Carol'' tells the story of a forbidden affair between an aspiring female photographer and an older woman going through a difficult divorce.\n\n''Carol'' had been in development since 1997, when Nagy wrote the first draft of the screenplay. British company [[Film4 Productions]] and its then-chief executive [[Tessa Ross]] financed development. The film had a [[development hell|troubled development period]], facing problems with financing, rights, scheduling conflicts, and accessibility. [[Number 9 Films]] came on board as a producer in 2011, when [[Elizabeth Karlsen]] secured the rights to the novel. The film is co-produced by New York-based [[Killer Films]], which joined the project in 2013 after Haynes's collaborator [[Christine Vachon]] approached him to direct. [[Principal photography]] on the British-American production began in March 2014, in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], and lasted 34 days. Cinematographer [[Edward Lachman]] shot ''Carol'' on [[16 mm film#Super 16 mm|Super 16 mm]] film.<ref name=Fauer2016>{{cite magazine|last1=Fauer |first1=Jon |title=Ed Lachman ASC on Super 16mm \"Carol\" |url=https://www.fdtimes.com/2016/01/29/ed-lachmans-super-16-carol/ |magazine=Film and Digital Times |date=January 29, 2016 |access-date=March 18, 2022 }}</ref><ref name=Mulcahey2016>{{cite magazine|last1=Mulcahey |first1=Matt |title=\"The Grain of Super 16 Gives the Film Another Layer\": Edward Lachman on ''Carol'' |url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/96921-the-grain-of-super-16-gives-the-film-another-layer-dp-edward-lachman-on-carol/ |magazine=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]] |date=January 14, 2016 |access-date=March 18, 2022 }}</ref>\n\n''Carol'' premiered at the [[2015 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] on May 17, 2015, and was [[theatrical release|released]] in the United States on November 20 and in the United Kingdom on November 27. Grossing over $42 million on an $11 million budget, the film was praised for Haynes's direction and the performances of Blanchett and Mara, and was the best-reviewed film of 2015. ''Carol'' competed for the [[Palme d'Or]] at Cannes, where Mara tied with [[Emmanuelle Bercot]] for the [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actress]] award. The film received many [[List of accolades received by Carol (film)|accolades]], including five [[73rd Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] nominations, six [[88th Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations, and nine [[69th British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] nominations; as well as five [[Dorian Awards]] and awards from the [[New York Film Critics Circle]], [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]], and [[National Society of Film Critics]].

She meets a glamorous woman, Carol Aird, who is searching for a doll for her daughter, Rindy. At Therese's recommendation, Carol purchases a model train set instead. When Carol departs, she leaves her gloves on the counter. Therese mails them to her using Frankenberg's sales slip with Carol's name and address.\n\nTherese's boyfriend, Richard, wants her to go to France with him, hoping they will marry, but she is ambivalent about their relationship. A common friend, Dannie, invites Therese to his workplace, ''[[The New York Times]]'', and offers to introduce her to a photo editor friend. Meanwhile, Carol is going through a difficult divorce from her husband, Harge. Carol calls Frankenberg's to thank the clerk who returned the gloves, and invites Therese to lunch. Therese visits Dannie and he kisses her, but she becomes uncomfortable and leaves.\n\nCarol invites Therese to her home in New Jersey. She stops to purchase a Christmas tree, and Therese takes candid photographs of her. Harge arrives unexpectedly to take Rindy to Florida for Christmas; he becomes suspicious of Therese, as Carol had an affair years before with her friend Abby. Therese witnesses their argument. After Rindy leaves, a distressed Carol takes Therese to the train station so she can return home.\n\nCarol calls to apologize to Therese and they meet at her apartment, where Carol surprises her with a suitcase containing a gift of a [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] camera and film. Carol has learned that Harge is petitioning the judge to consider a \"[[Morals clause|morality clause]]\" against her, threatening to expose her [[homosexuality]] and give him full custody of Rindy. She decides to take a road trip to escape the stress of the divorce proceedings and invites Therese to join her. Richard accuses Therese of being infatuated with Carol, and predicts Carol will soon tire of her. The two argue and their relationship comes to an end. On the second night of the trip, Therese meets a traveling salesman, Tommy Tucker.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, Carol and Therese kiss for the first time and have sex. The next morning, they discover that Tucker is actually a private investigator Harge hired to obtain evidence against Carol. Carol confronts Tucker, threatening him at gunpoint, but he claims to have already sent tape recordings to Harge. Carol and Therese turn back. The next day, in Chicago, Therese learns that Carol has flown home to fight for custody of her daughter, having asked Abby to drive Therese home. Abby gives her a letter from Carol. Back at home, Therese telephones Carol, but knowing that she risks losing custody of Rindy if she continues her relationship with Therese, Carol hangs up.\n\nTherese creates a portfolio of her photographs and gets a job at ''The New York Times''. In the meantime, Carol has been seeing a psychotherapist as a condition of the divorce settlement. During a confrontational meeting in mid-April with divorce lawyers, Carol suddenly admits to the truth of what the tapes contain, and refuses to deny her sexuality. To avoid going to court and the likelihood of a public scandal, she tells Harge that he can have custody of Rindy if he allows her regular visits.\n\nCarol writes to Therese, and they meet in the lounge of the [[Ritz Tower]] Hotel. Carol reveals she is going to work for a furniture house, and has taken an apartment on Madison Avenue. Therese declines Carol's invitation to live with her. Carol tells Therese that she is meeting associates in the [[Oak Room (Plaza Hotel)|Oak Room]], and that if she changes her mind they can have dinner. Therese remains still and Carol says, \"I love you.\" They are interrupted by Jack, a colleague who has not seen Therese in months, and Carol departs.\n\nTherese accepts Jack's ride to a party, but finds she cannot connect with anyone. She leaves for the Oak Room. She scans the diners and sees Carol at a table. Therese hesitates, then walks toward Carol. Their eyes meet. Carol gazes at Therese with a smile that slowly grows.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--US poster @ http://www.impawards.com/2015/carol_xlg.html \u2014 UK poster @ http://www.impawards.com/2015/carol_ver2_xlg.html -->\n<!--Actors billed in film opening credits or film poster, in the order of billing.-->\n<!--Film opening credits: Blanchett, Mara, Paulson, Lacy, Magaro, Smith, Brownstein, Crowley, Pajic, \"and Kyle Chandler\".-->\n\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as Carol Aird\n* [[Rooney Mara]] as Therese Belivet\n* [[Sarah Paulson]] as Abby Gerhard\n* [[Jake Lacy]] as Richard Semco\n* [[John Magaro]] as Dannie McElroy\n* [[Cory Michael Smith]] as Tommy Tucker\n* [[Carrie Brownstein]] as Genevieve Cantrell\n* Kevin Crowley as Fred Haymes\n* Nik Pajic as Phil McElroy\n* [[Kyle Chandler]] as Harge Aird\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Carol'' is based on [[Patricia Highsmith]]'s 1952 semi-autobiographical [[romance novel|romantic novel]] ''[[The Price of Salt]]''.

Karlsen recalled making a film 27 years earlier in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], that was set in 1950s New York. After researching the city, she found that it had not changed much in decades, with Ohio also having one of the best [[Movie production incentives in the United States|film tax incentives]] in the
