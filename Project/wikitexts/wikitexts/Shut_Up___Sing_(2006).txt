Bush]] during a live 2003 concert in London as part of their [[Top of the World Tour]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{See also|Dixie Chicks controversy}}\n\nThe title of the film was inspired by conservative commentator [[Laura Ingraham]], who coined the phrase \"shut up and sing\" in such context earlier; it was the title of her 2003 book ''[[Shut Up & Sing: How Elites from Hollywood, Politics, and the UN Are Subverting America]]''. The tagline of the film, \"freedom of speech is fine as long as you don't do it in public\", is a reference to a scene in which an interviewed protester says \"freedom of speech is fine but by God you don't do it outside of the country and you don't do it in mass publicly\".\n\nThe film opens during the [[Dixie Chicks|Dixie Chicks']] 2003 [[Top of the World Tour]], discussing the Dixie Chicks' superstar status prior to the incident at their London show.  They had sold more albums in the United States than any other female band in history. With the release of their 2002 album ''[[Home (Dixie Chicks album)|Home]]'', they were again at the top of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts. The new [[single (music)|single]] from that album \"[[Travelin' Soldier]]\", a sensitive depiction of a soldier's life during the [[Vietnam War]] era, and the young woman who waited for him, finding he was killed in battle, had peaked at number 1 on the US ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] Chart.\n\nThe film then cuts to a scene from the [[Dixie Chicks]]' March 10, 2003 concert at the [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]] Theatre in London, England. The atmosphere in the European audience is of dramatic opposition to the announcement from [[United States President]] [[George W. Bush|George W. Bush's]] authorization of the invasion of Iraq.  Approximately 1 million people had recently demonstrated in London against the impending war.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/mar/10/politics.antiwar \"Thousands more take stand against conflict in demonstrations throughout Britain\"] The Guardian, 10 March 2003.  Access date 15 May 2010.</ref> During the introduction to their song \"[[Travelin' Soldier]]\", [[Natalie Maines]], a Texas native, says:\n{{cquote|Just so you know, we\u2019re on the good side with y\u2019all.

[https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,943170,00.html \"'Dixie sluts' fight on with naked defiance\"] ''Guardian Unlimited'' (accessed 2006-04-13)</ref> Conservative groups in the U.S. rallied against the [[Dixie Chicks]] and a firestorm of anger and criticism followed.\n\nThe film shows the band's reaction to the open hostility, political and corporate backlash, and physical threats directed at the group. The band did not expect such a strong reaction, and they are unsure if they should \"shut up and sing\", apologize, or stand by their convictions and let more sparks fly.\n\nThe film follows the day-to-day life of the Chicks.  It shows them with their husbands and their children, at home in Texas and in the recording studio in [[Los Angeles]], getting their hair and makeup done before appearances, exchanging ribald remarks with each other, writing song lyrics and working on musical arrangements.  Simon Renshaw, the group's longtime manager, is the focus of many scenes as he attempts to guide the Chicks through the vicissitudes of the music industry.\n\nThe title of the film is a lyric from the Dixie Chicks' 2006 post-controversy single \"[[Not Ready to Make Nice]]\" from the album ''[[Taking the Long Way]]''.  It was the criticism and hate mail that they received because of their political statements, one of which drew such concern from both the [[FBI]] and the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] that they advised the Chicks to cancel a concert in [[Dallas, Texas]], and they were shown the original letter that specified a date, time, and location at which lead singer Natalie Maines would be shot dead, unless she \"shut up and sang\".  However, the show took place without incident.  Living in a constant state of fear took an emotional toll on the Chicks, in particular because they toured with their children.<ref name=\"Cohn\">Cohn, Angel [https://www.tvguide.com/movies/dixie-chicks-shut/review/284106 TV Guide Shut Up and Sing Review Retrieved 12 June, 2008]</ref>\n\nThe song, \"[[Not Ready to Make Nice]]\" includes a reference to that very real death threat:\n\n<blockquote>\nAnd how in the world can the words that I said <br>\nSend somebody so over the edge <br> \nThat they'd write me a letter <br>\nSaying that I better <br> \nshut up and sing or my life will be over?!<br>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Martie Maguire]] as Herself\n* [[Natalie Maines]] as Herself\n* [[Emily Robison]] as Herself\n* [[Adrian Pasdar]] as Himself\n* [[Rick Rubin]] as Himself\n* [[Pat Buchanan]] as Himself (footage)\n* [[Barbara Boxer]] as Herself (footage)\n* [[George W.

NBC publicly acknowledged the decision but claimed that it was willing to work with Weinstein to find an acceptable alternative.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6094446.stm?categoryid=14&cs=1 ''Dixie Chicks film ad sparks row''] BBC, October 28, 2006</ref> At the same time, the distributor also claimed that [[The CW]] had refused to air these advertisements, citing \"concerns we do not have appropriate programming in which to schedule this spot\". That network later said its statement was merely an opinion on whether its target audience would respond to the ad, and that it would have accepted the ads if Weinstein had actually bought commercial time.<ref>[https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117952760.html?categoryid=14&cs=1 Prickly Peacock nixes Chicks], ''Variety'', October 26, 2006</ref>\n\nAt the time, [[CBS]] was the only major television network to have agreed to air the ads for the film, according to a Weinstein spokesperson, who said the company was also waiting on responses from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[Fox Network|Fox]].<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-10-28-dixie-chicks_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA?categoryid=14&cs=1 ''NBC rejects TV ads for Dixie Chicks film''], David Bauder, ''USA Today'', September 28</ref> It is not clear which decision either network ultimately made. However, individual stations affiliated with all five networks, including some owned by NBC, aired the ad during local ad time.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] on October 27, 2006 in only 4 theatres. In its first week it grossed an average of [[US dollar|US$]]50,103.
