Marking Bateman's [[List of directorial debuts|feature film directorial debut]], the film stars Bateman as a middle-aged [[eighth grade#Canada and the United States|eighth grade]] dropout who enters the National Golden Quill Spelling Bee through a loophole. It also stars [[Kathryn Hahn]], [[Rohan Chand]], [[Ben Falcone]], [[Philip Baker Hall]], and [[Allison Janney]].\n\nDodge's screenplay for ''Bad Words'' was featured on the 2011 [[Black List (survey)|Black List]] and was shortly thereafter picked up by Bateman. In the original script, the story was set at the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]], but the name was changed to a fictional bee since the filmmakers did not expect Scripps to allow the use of their name in the film. After two other actors declined to play the main character, Bateman decided to take on the role himself, and cast the other roles by a combination of contacting friends and open casting calls. Filming took place in Los Angeles at the end of 2012.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 6, 2013, and had a limited release in the United States on March 14, 2014, expanding to a wide release on March 28. Produced for $10 million, it earned $7.8 million at the theatrical box office. It received mixed reviews from critics: some enjoyed the humor and direction, while others found the main character unlikeable and the humor offensive.\n\n==Plot==\nForty-year-old Guy Trilby discovers a loophole in the Golden Quill Spelling Bee which stipulates that participants must have not graduated from the eighth grade, allowing him to enter since he dropped out of middle school. He attends and wins a regional spelling bee, and progresses to the national competition after confrontations with both the parents of children and the spelling bee hosts. He is accompanied by Jenny Widgeon, a relatively unknown journalist hoping to make a story out of his participation in the bee. On the flight to the national spelling bee, Guy meets Chaitanya Chopra, a 10-year-old entrant in the bee who persistently attempts to befriend Guy. Upon his arrival in Los Angeles, Guy meets the director of the spelling bee, Dr. Bernice Deagan, who expresses anger at his participation in the bee and places him and his reporter in a cheap hotel. Guy learns that Chaitanya is staying in the same hotel, and takes him out one night to expose Chaitanya to the wilder side of life: stealing food, drinking, and hiring a prostitute to briefly \"flash\" Chaitanya.\n\nIn the bee, Guy actively tries to distract and disconcert his fellow competitors, at one point insinuating that he was sleeping with another contestant's mother. Despite Dr. Deagan's tampering with the word list to give Guy the most difficult words, he spells long, complicated words with relative ease, impressing and angering both parents and staff at the spelling bee, including the event's founder, Dr. William Bowman. However, the parents petition for his disqualification and the resignation of Deagan. While researching Guy's background, Jenny discovers that Bowman is Guy's father. She reveals this to him and he admits that his prime motivation for entering the bee was to embarrass his father in revenge for abandoning him and his mother when he was a child. Soon before the final stage of the bee, Guy overhears Chaitanya and his father discussing his strategy to win, which is to befriend Guy so that he will allow Chaitanya to win out of guilt. Guy storms into the room and ends his friendship with Chaitanya, despite Chaitanya's pleas that he genuinely wanted to be friends. They later sabotage each other: Guy burns Chaitanya's study book, \"Todd,\" and Chaitanya files a false police report, accusing Guy of kidnapping a young girl.\n\nMeanwhile, only ten competitors remain in the bee, and the pool is gradually reduced to just Guy and Chaitanya. When a contestant's mother attacks Guy verbally and is subdued by the police on live television, Bowman is forced to intervene, to his embarrassment. Having accomplished his goal, Guy deliberately misspells a word in an effort to let Chaitanya win. To prove his friendship, Chaitanya also misspells his word, and they soon begin to argue. This escalates into a physical fight, with Chaitanya first kicking Guy's genitals, much to the shock of the audience and when Bowman attempts to intervene, Chaitanya accidentally hits him with a chair. Although the bee is briefly halted, Bowman allows it to continue after deciding that both Guy and Chaitanya acted in an equally embarrassing manner. Their standoff of deliberately misspelling words continues until Guy intentionally misspells Chaitanya's word so that Chaitanya corrects him, thus causing Chaitanya to win the bee inadvertently. As Guy leaves, content, Chaitanya offers to give him half the winnings and names him co-winner of the bee. Guy writes a note to Bowman explaining his actions, which Bowman refuses to read until Guy reveals himself to be his son, and returns home. He resolves his conflict with Chaitanya by buying an old police car from an auction with his share of the winnings, and helping Chaitanya to chase down his school bullies.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Guy Trilby\n* [[Kathryn Hahn]] as Jenny Widgeon\n* [[Rohan Chand]] as Chaitanya Chopra\n* [[Ben Falcone]] as Pete Fowler\n* [[Philip Baker Hall]] as Dr. William Bowman\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Dr. Bernice Deagan\n* [[Rachael Harris]] as Mrs. Tai\n* [[Judith Hoag]] as Petal Dubois\n* [[Beth Grant]] as Irene\n* [[Patricia Belcher]] as Ingrid Cole\n* [[Anjul Nigam]] as Sriram\n* Michael Patrick McGill as Beet-Red Father\n* [[Bob Stephenson (actor)|Bob Stephenson]] as Bill Murhoff\n* [[Steve Witting]] as Proctor\n* Greg Cromer as Jeremy\n* [[Ethan Dizon]] as Ricky Irvine\n* [[Madison Hu]] as Ling Quan\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:JasonBateman-adjusted.jpg|right|thumb|Jason Bateman directed ''Bad Words'' and cast himself in the main role.]]\nAndrew Dodge's screenplay for ''Bad Words'' first received attention after its inclusion on the 2011 [[The Black List (survey)|Black List]], an annual survey of the best unproduced screenplays in Hollywood.<ref>{{cite web|last=Finke|first=Nikki|title=The Black List 2011: Screenplay Roster|url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/12/the-black-list-2011-screenplay-roster/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|access-date=November 4, 2013|date=December 12, 2011}}</ref><ref name=npr>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/03/17/280673991/jason-bateman-taking-a-turn-as-the-big-bad|work=[[All Things Considered]]|first=Audie|last=Cornish|title=Jason Bateman, Taking A Turn As The Big Bad|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=March 17, 2014|access-date=August 3, 2014}}</ref> The script was sent to actor [[Jason Bateman]], who had asked his agent to pursue directorial work, explaining that being able to direct films was \"really the only reason I've been acting for the last 20 years of this career\".<ref name=thr>{{cite web|last=Siegel|first=Tatiana|title=Toronto: Jason Bateman on His Directorial Debut, 'Bad Words,' and Why He Cast Himself (Q&A)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/toronto-bad-words-jason-bateman-622520|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|access-date=November 4, 2013|date=September 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter Bateman signed on to direct the film, he and Dodge spent a long time revising the script, particularly adjusting parts where the dark humor \"went a little bit too far\".<ref name=rogue>{{cite web|url=http://www.iamrogue.com/news/interviews/item/10853-iar-interview-jason-bateman-talks-bad-words.html|work=I Am Rogue|date=March 11, 2014|first=Jami|last=Philbrick|title= IAR INTERVIEW: Jason Bateman Talks 'Bad Words' |access-date=August 3, 2014}}</ref> In the original script, the story was intended to take place at the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The setting was changed to the fictional Golden Quill Spelling Bee in [[Los Angeles]] since Bateman did not expect to receive permission from Scripps to use their name in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vagabuzz.com/badwordslocation |title=Jason Bateman Chose L.A.
