The women wait for the driver at the diner, but when they fail to identify him, they draw guns on the diner's other occupants and demand if anyone knows who the driver is. Instead, a shootout ensues when Francine, the diner's owner, and Jesse, a patron, draw firearms of their own. Kara, Francine, Dawn, and Jesse are killed and Tes finds herself in a standoff with Billy, the diner's cook. As Tes and Billy point their weapons at each other, their situation becomes more complicated when Ronny, another associate of Mel's, arrives at the diner.\n\nIt is eventually revealed that no drugs were coming to the diner and the job was a set-up. Mel hired Billy, Jesse, and Francine, who all work for him, to kill Tes and her cohorts. Ronny, who is infatuated with Tes, says he came to the diner to rescue her and steal the money Mel supposedly gave Billy for this assignment, although Billy denies having it. Ronny orders Tes to shoot Billy, but she turns her gun on Ronny, and a second shootout occurs.\n\nMel comes to the diner and discovers Ronny is apparently the only survivor of the gunfight. After a brief conversation, Mel shoots Ronny in the face. Tes, however, turns out to still be alive and guns Mel down. She then intercepts a car carrying Mel's money and drives off with the cash.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Malin \u00c5kerman]] as Tes\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Mel\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Ronny\n* [[Nikki Reed]] as Kara\n* [[Deborah Ann Woll]] as Dawn\n* [[Shea Whigham]] as Billy\n* [[Brad Dourif]] as Sheriff Connors\n* Jimmy Lee Jr. as Jesse\n* Jill Stokesberry as Francine\n* PJ Marshall as Deputy \n* Dan Silver as Businessman David\n* [[Michael Rosenbaum]] as Brandon\n* Edrick Browne as Davon\n\n==Production==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2012}}\nShooting started on July 8, 2010 in [[Louisiana]], and lasted 20 days.\n\nEarly on, there were several changes to the cast, particularly within the female lead roles. [[Maggie Grace]] was originally attached to play Tes, and [[Lauren German]] was attached to play Kara, however both women had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts. [[Laura Ramsey]] was also considered for the role of Dawn.\n\nAfter [[Malin \u00c5kerman]] signed on to play Tes, [[Bruce Willis]] and [[Forest Whitaker]] were attached to the film.
