Fans gather to celebrate the movie at screenings.\n\nDirector of the documentary [[Michael Stephenson (filmmaker)|Michael Stephenson]], who played the young boy in Troll 2, interviews many of the former cast and crew. Although many consider ''Troll 2'' to be one of the worst movies ever made, many fans have had parties, annual screenings, and found joy in watching the unintended humor of the movie.\n\nThe documentary follows lead actor of ''Troll 2'' [[George Hardy (actor)|George Hardy]], a dentist living in his hometown Alabama where he is well-liked by people around him and embraces the role he had in the movie. He is seen trying to convince his neighbors to attend a local screening of the film and also goes to conventions. He mentions that if he could have chosen to be an actor or a dentist, he would have been an actor as he did not mind the spotlight.\n\n[[Claudio Fragasso]], director of ''Troll 2'', is also featured discussing what he intended this film to become. He is happy to see the cult following that his original film has achieved but fails to understand why fans of the movie laughed at scenes that were not intended to be funny. When asked why the film was called \"Troll 2\" when there were no trolls in the film, he initially does not understand the question and after being told that the creatures in the film are called goblins, he scoffs at the question. Although Fragasso is made aware that his film is considered to be a poorly-made one, he is glad the film has had an impression on its viewers.\n\nOther actors of the cast and crew do Q&A sessions with fans of the film. Some joke that they had never read the entire script when their parts were filmed. Others say that they never knew what kind of movie they were filming. Margo Prey, who played the wife of Hardy's character in ''Troll 2'', was interviewed but did not want to go to the local screening of the film because of how \"complicated\" it would have been. More former cast members were interviewed at their homes to discuss their thoughts on the film and what the film has become since the production.\n\nIn the end, Hardy stated that he would do ''Troll 3'' if he were asked to do so. During the credits, it was noted that Fragasso was writing his next film ''Troll 2: Part 2''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Stephenson (filmmaker)|Michael Stephenson]]\n* [[George Hardy (actor)|George Hardy]]\n* Lily Hardy\n* Pita Ray\n* Micki Knox\n* Tommy Bice\n* Lila Graves\n* Laura Gulledge\n* Merry Hardy\n* Barbara H.

I was next to my wife and I said, 'I am the child star of the worst movie ever made... there's a story here'\".<ref name=io9/>\n\nNot all participants in ''Troll 2'' were eager to revisit the film. Stephenson noted that he had trouble convincing actors Don Packard and Connie Young to be included in the project, although he was eventually able to convince both to appear in it.<ref name=io9/>\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the [[South by Southwest]] festival in March 2009, and was released on DVD in November 2010.\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=September 2012}}\n''Best Worst Movie'' received positive reviews.
