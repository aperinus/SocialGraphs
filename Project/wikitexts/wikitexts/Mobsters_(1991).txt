It details the creation of [[The Commission (mafia)|The Commission]]. Set in [[New York City]], taking place from 1917 to 1931, it is a semi-fictitious account of the rise of [[Lucky Luciano|Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano]], [[Meyer Lansky]], [[Frank Costello]], and [[Bugsy Siegel|Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel]]. The film stars [[Christian Slater]] as Luciano, [[Patrick Dempsey]] as Lansky, [[Costas Mandylor]] as Costello and [[Richard Grieco]] as Siegel, with [[Michael Gambon]], [[Anthony Quinn]], [[Lara Flynn Boyle]], and [[F. Murray Abraham]] in supporting roles.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{More plot|date=July 2009}}\nThe film recounts the rise of four  Infamous gangsters: Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel, and Frank Costello. The four begin as members of youth gangs on the streets of [[New York City|New York]], fighting and hustling as they learn the rules of the street and form strong friendships that benefit them as they grow into their teenage years. The beginning of [[Prohibition]] provides them with an entry into organized crime, and under the mentorship of seasoned gangsters such as [[Arnold Rothstein]], they build up a lucrative [[rum-running|bootlegging]] empire.\n\nDespite their success, the four come into conflict with the established leaders of the [[American Cosa Nostra|Mafia]], who dislike the idea of working with other criminal organizations to maximize profits and compete with each other for power and influence. Believing that the Mafia must restructure itself in order to thrive, Luciano and Lansky recruit Siegel and Costello to eliminate their bosses and assume control, setting up the [[The Commission (mafia)|Commission]] and dividing the New York underworld between [[Five Families|five families]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/work/mobsters-32986 |title=Mobsters - Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast |publisher=AllMovie |date=1991-07-26 |access-date=2012-07-09}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}<!-- Cast is in credits order and named as credited; please do not change. -->\n* [[Christian Slater]] as [[Charlie \"Lucky\" Luciano]]\n* [[Patrick Dempsey]] as [[Meyer Lansky]]\n* [[Costas Mandylor]] as [[Frank Costello]]\n* [[Richard Grieco]] as [[Bugsy Siegel|Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel]]\n* [[F.

The website's critics consensus reads: 'Despite an abundance of style and some big names, ''Mobsters'' can't escape its empty plotting, numbing violence, and Gangster Movie 101 concepts.'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mobsters|title= Mobsters (1991)|website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=March 20, 2020}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemascore.com|title=Find CinemaScore|format=Type \"Mobsters\" in the search box|publisher=[[CinemaScore]]|access-date=March 29, 2020}}</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that \"''Mobsters'' resembles a cart-before-the-horse case of putting marketing ahead of film-making, as the seemingly can't-miss premise of teen-heartthrob gangsters gets lost in self-important direction, a shoddy script and muddled storytelling.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Review: 'Mobsters'|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117793179?refcatid=31|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 31, 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108054950/https://variety.com/review/VE1117793179?refcatid=31|archive-date=8 November 2012}}</ref>\nAccording to [[Roger Ebert]], the movie's violence and bloodshed are so far over the top that 'they undermine the rest of the film, and approach parody'; he gave it two and a half out of four stars.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nBoth [[Anthony Quinn]] and [[Christian Slater]] were nominated for [[Razzie Award]]s as Worst Supporting Actor for their performances, but lost to [[Dan Aykroyd]] for ''[[Nothing But Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing But Trouble]]''.\n\nSlater said he was hoping that the film would be like the much more successful ''[[Bugsy]]'', but this did not happen: 'Our movie ended up in bits and pieces all over the world,\" he said. \"They had different versions flying to Japan, Europe and every other place. There were extended versions, shortened versions; all kinds of weird versions. In my opinion, audiences never got to see a full film. Somewhere in all that mess, there was a legitimate story. It was there in the script.'<ref>[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-01-13/features/1992013091_1_christian-slater-kuffs-robin-hood \"Hot Christian Slater enjoys 'Kuffs' role: 'I could just relax and play the character\"].
