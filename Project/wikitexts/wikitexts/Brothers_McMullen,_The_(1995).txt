It deals with the lives of the three [[Irish Catholic]] McMullen brothers from [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], over three months, as they grapple with basic ideas and values&mdash;love, sex, marriage, religion and family&mdash;in the 1990s, this is the first [[Fox Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight]] film.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with Finbar \"Barry\" McMullen standing at the grave of his recently deceased father, along with his mother, who tells him that she's returning to her native Ireland to be with Finbar O'Shaughnessy (after whom Barry is named), her sweetheart of long ago. She tells Barry that while she gave Barry's father 35 of the best years of her life, she's going to start living life her way with Finbar O'Shaughnessy, the man she really loves.\n\nJack has purchased their parents' home and lives in it with his wife Molly. Jack is torn between his love for Molly and his lust for Ann, a former romantic interest of Barry.\n\nBarry and the youngest brother Patrick ask to temporarily move in with Jack, to which he reluctantly agrees. Patrick plans to break his engagement to Susan, but becomes depressed when she breaks up with him. After much pleading, Susan decides to take him back. Patrick then decides to end the relationship for good for Leslie, an auto mechanic. They head to California together in a classic car that Leslie has been working on.\n\nBarry shows no interest in a long-term relationship until he meets Audrey, a woman whom he accuses of \"stealing\" an apartment that he was trying to rent for himself. Although things do not go well between them at first, they warm to one another and start a relationship.\n\nMolly learns of Jack's affair after finding a wrapped condom in his pants as she is cleaning up after him one day. She confronts Jack, but he refuses to discuss it.\n\nJack finally breaks it off for good with Ann. He then returns home determined to rebuild his wounded marriage, but not before paying a visit to his father's grave, promising (in a voice-over) that he will be a better husband to his wife than his father was, pouring a bottle of Irish whiskey over the grave.\n\nBarry decides to move in with Audrey and take their relationship to the next level. The movie ends with all three brothers gathering at the family homestead with a newfound belief in love and a desire not to let the ghosts of the past stand in their way.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- as credited, in alphabetical order --->\n* Shari Albert as Susan\n* [[Maxine Bahns]] as Audrey\n* Catherine Bolz as Mrs. McMullen\n* [[Connie Britton]] as Molly McMullen\n* [[Edward Burns]] as Barry (Finbar) McMullen\n* Peter Johansen as Marty\n* [[Jennifer Jostyn]] as Leslie\n* [[Mike McGlone|Michael McGlone]] as Patrick McMullen\n* Elizabeth McKay as Ann\n* [[Jack Mulcahy (actor)|Jack Mulcahy]] as Jack McMullen\n\n==Production==\nEdward Burns wrote the screenplay in the spring of 1993 while working as a production assistant for ''Entertainment Tonight'', where he worked for cameraman Dick Fisher, who later produced and edited the film.

Redford later extended an invitation to show it at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].<ref name=LunchOnly/> The showing led to a distribution deal, which included an additional $200,000 for post production work and to get the rights for the [[Sarah McLachlan]] song \"[[I Will Remember You (Sarah McLachlan song)|I Will Remember You]]\", which was added over the closing credits.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film won the [[Grand Jury Prize]] at the 1995 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It was picked up for distribution by [[20th Century Fox]] and grossed over $10&nbsp;million at the US and Canadian box office.

Edward Burns was called \"The New Woody Allen\" and even continued to make Woody Allen-esque films afterwards.\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an 87% rating based on 38 critics with the consensus: \"Like many twenty-somethings, ''The Brothers McMullen'' can be a tad self-absorbed, but they're still likely to win you over with their (slightly profane) charm.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/brothers_mcmullen/|title=The Brothers McMullen|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=25 April 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n* [[Sundance Film Festival]] 1995 \u2014 Grand Jury Prize\n* [[Independent Spirit Award]] 1995 \u2014 Best First Feature\n* [[Deauville American Film Festival|Deauville Film Festival]] 1995 \u2014 Jury Special Prize (Edward Burns)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0112585}}\n* {{tcmdb title|69805}}\n* {{Amg movie|133593}}\n* {{mojo title|brothersmcmullen}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|brothers_mcmullen}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n\n{{Edward Burns}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brothers Mcmullen, The}}\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1995 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1995 independent films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about brothers]]\n[[Category:Films about Irish-American culture]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Edward Burns]]\n[[Category:Films set in Long Island]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Fox Searchlight Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Sundance Film Festival award winners]]"}]}}}}
