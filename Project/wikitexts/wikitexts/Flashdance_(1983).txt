It was the first collaboration of producers [[Don Simpson]] and [[Jerry Bruckheimer]], and the presentation of some sequences in the style of [[music video]]s was an influence on other 1980s films including ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]'', ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]]'', and ''[[Top Gun]]'', Simpson and Bruckheimer's most famous production.

What a Feeling]]\", which was written for the film by Moroder, with lyrics by [[Keith Forsey]] and the singer [[Irene Cara]]. ''Flashdance'' is also often remembered for its [[film poster]] featuring Beals sporting a [[sweatshirt]] with a large neck hole (according to the actress, her look in the scene came about by accident after she simply cut a large hole at the top of one that had shrunk in the wash).\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:flashdance beals nouri.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Jennifer Beals]] and [[Michael Nouri]] star in ''Flashdance'']]\nAlexandra \"Alex\" Owens ([[Jennifer Beals]]) is an eighteen-year-old [[Welding|welder]] at a [[steel mill]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], who lives with her dog, Grunt, in a converted warehouse. She aspires to become a professional dancer, but has no formal dance training and works as a nightly cabaret performer at Mawby's, a neighborhood bar and grill.\n\nLacking family, Alex bonds with her coworkers at Mawby's, some of whom also aspire to greater artistic achievements. Jeanie ([[Sunny Johnson]]), a waitress, is training to be a [[figure skating|figure skater]], while her boyfriend, short-order cook Richie ([[Kyle T. Heffner]]), hopes to become a [[stand-up comic]].\n\nOne night, Alex catches the eye of customer Nick Hurley ([[Michael Nouri]]), the owner of the steel mill where she works. After learning that Alex is one of his employees, Nick pursues her on the job, though Alex turns down his advances. Alex is also approached by Johnny C. ([[Lee Ving]]), who wants her to dance at his nearby [[strip club]], Zanzibar.\n\nAfter seeking counsel from her mentor, retired [[ballerina]] Hanna Long ([[Lilia Skala]]), Alex attempts to apply to the Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance and Repertory. She becomes intimidated by the scope of the application process, which includes listing all prior dance experience and education, so she leaves without applying. Leaving Mawby's one evening, Richie and Alex are assaulted by Johnny C. and his bodyguard, Cecil. Nick intervenes, and after taking Alex home, the two begin a relationship.\n\nIn a skating competition, Jeanie falls twice during her performance and sits defeated on the ice before being helped away. Discouraged by her failure and the departure of Richie, who has decided to try his luck in Los Angeles, Jeanie begins dating Johnny C. and working as one of his strippers at Zanzibar. After finding out about Jeanie's situation from Jake, Alex finds her and drags her out of Zanzibar. Jeanie is angry, but she soon realizes her mistake.\n\nAfter seeing Nick with a woman at the ballet one night, Alex throws a rock through a window of his house, only to discover that it was his [[ex-wife]] ([[Belinda Bauer (actress)|Belinda Bauer]]), whom he was meeting for a charity function. Alex and Nick reconcile, and she gains the courage to apply to the Conservatory. Nick uses his connections with the arts council to get Alex an audition. Upon discovering this, Alex is furious with Nick because she did not get the opportunity based on merit, and she decides not to go through with the audition. Seeing the results of others' failed dreams and after the sudden death of Hanna, Alex becomes despondent about her future, but finally decides to go through with the audition.\n\nAt the audition, Alex falters, but begins again and successfully completes a dance number composed of moves that she has studied and practiced, including [[breakdancing]] which she has seen on the streets of Pittsburgh. The board responds favorably, and Alex is seen joyously emerging from the Conservatory to find Nick and Grunt waiting for her with a bouquet of roses.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jennifer Beals]] as Alexandra \"Alex\" Owens\n* [[Michael Nouri]] as Nick Hurley\n* [[Lilia Skala]] as Hanna Long\n* [[Sunny Johnson]] as Jeanie Szabo\n* [[Kyle T.

What a Feeling]]\" was performed by [[Irene Cara]], who also sang the title song for the similar 1980 film ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]''. The music for \"Flashdance... What a Feeling\" was composed by [[Giorgio Moroder]], and the lyrics were written by Cara and [[Keith Forsey]]. The song won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]], as well as a [[41st Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] and numerous other awards. It also reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in May 1983. Despite the song's title, the word 'Flashdance' itself is not heard in the lyrics. The song is used in the opening title sequence of the film, and is the music Alex uses in her dance audition routine at the end of the film.\n{{listen\n|filename=Flashdance.ogg\n|title=Irene Cara - \"Flashdance...

It was written by [[Michael Sembello]] and Dennis Matkosky. A popular [[urban legend]] holds that the song was originally written for the 1980 [[horror film]] ''[[Maniac (1980 film)|Maniac]]'', and that lyrics about a killer on the loose were rewritten so the song could be used in ''Flashdance''. The legend is discredited in the special features of the film's [[DVD-Video|DVD]] release, which reveal that the song was written for the film, although only two complete lyrics (\"Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night\" and \"She's a maniac\") were available when filming commenced.

[[Thomas Hedley|Tom Hedley]] wrote the original story outline for ''Flashdance'', and on December 6, 1982, Marder signed a release document giving [[Paramount Pictures]] the right to portray her life story on screen, for which she was given a one-off payment of $2,300. ''Flashdance'' is estimated to have grossed more than $200 million worldwide. In June 2006, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] affirmed a lower court's ruling that Marder gave up her rights to the film when she signed the release document in 1982. The panel of three judges stated in its ruling: \"Though in hindsight the agreement appears to be unfair to Marder\u2014she only received $2,300 in exchange for a release of all claims relating to a movie that grossed over $150 million\u2014there is simply no evidence that her consent was obtained by [[fraud]], [[deception offences|deception]], [[misrepresentation]], [[duress (contract law)|duress]] or [[undue influence]].\" The court also noted that Marder's [[Lawyer|attorney]] had been present when she signed the document.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/06/13/BAGJSJD89U1.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=SAN FRANCISCO / Inspiration for 'Flashdance' loses appeal for more money | first=Suzanne | last=Herel | date=2006-06-13}}</ref>\n\n===Suit against Jennifer Lopez and filmmakers over music video===\nIn 2003, following the use of dance routines from the film by [[Jennifer Lopez]] in her music video \"[[I'm Glad]]\" (directed by [[David LaChapelle]]), Marder sued Lopez, [[Sony|Sony Corporation]] (the makers of the music video), and Paramount in an attempt to gain a [[copyright]] interest in the film.
