The sixth film in the ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' franchise, it was loosely adapted from [[Pierre Boulle]]'s 1963 [[Planet of the Apes (novel)|novel of the same name]] and serves as a [[remake]] of the 1968 [[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|film version]]. It tells the story of astronaut Leo Davidson crash-landing on a planet inhabited by intelligent apes. The apes treat humans as slaves, but with the help of an ape named Ari, Leo starts a rebellion.\n\nDevelopment for a ''Planet of the Apes'' remake started as far back as 1988 with [[Adam Rifkin]]. His project nearly reached the [[pre-production]] stage before being canceled. [[Terry Hayes]]'s script, titled ''Return of the Apes'', would have starred [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], under the direction of [[Phillip Noyce]]. [[Oliver Stone]], [[Don Murphy]], and [[Jane Hamsher]] were set to produce. Creative differences ensued between Hayes and financier/distributor [[20th Century Fox]]. [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], [[Sam Hamm]], [[James Cameron]], [[Peter Jackson]], and the [[Hughes brothers]] later became involved. With [[William Broyles Jr.]]'s script, Burton was hired as director, and the film was put into active development. [[Lawrence Konner]] and [[Mark Rosenthal (screenwriter)|Mark Rosenthal]] rewrote the script, and filming took place from November 2000 to April 2001.\n\n''Planet of the Apes'' was released theatrically on July 27, 2001, by 20th Century Fox. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who criticized the confusing plot and ending, but praised [[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]]'s [[prosthetic makeup]] designs, visual aspects and musical score. Despite its financial success, Fox chose not to produce a sequel, and later [[reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] the franchise in 2011 with ''[[Rise of the Planet of the Apes]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2029, aboard the [[United States Air Force]] space station ''Oberon'', Leo Davidson works closely with apes who are trained for space missions. His favorite ape co-worker is a chimpanzee named Pericles. With a deadly electromagnetic storm approaching the station, a small space pod piloted by Pericles is used to probe the storm. Pericles's pod heads into the storm and disappears. Leo takes a second pod and finds Pericles. Entering the storm, Leo loses contact with the ''Oberon'' and, in 5021 A.D., crashes on a planet called Ashlar. He learns that the world is ruled by humanoid apes who speak English, use domesticated horses for transportation, and treat human beings as slaves.\n\nLeo meets a female chimpanzee named Ari, who protests the mistreatment humans receive. Ari decides to buy Leo and a female slave named Daena to have them work as servants in the house of her father, Senator Sandar. Leo escapes his cage and frees other humans. Limbo, an orangutan trader in captured humans, sees them but is taken prisoner to ensure his silence. The murderous General Thade and his junior, Colonel Attar, march ape warriors to pursue the humans. Leo discovers Calima, the forbidden, but holy temple of \"Semos\", the first ape whom the apes revere as a god.\n\nCalima turns out to be the remains of the ''Oberon'' which had crashed on the planet's surface and now looks ancient (the name Calima coming from the sign \"'''CA'''ution '''LI'''ve ani'''MA'''ls\", the relevant letters being the only ones not covered in dust). According to the computer logs, the station has been there for thousands of years. Leo deduces that when he entered the vortex, he was pushed forward in time, while the ''Oberon'', searching after him, was not, crashing on the planet long before he did.\n\nThe ''Oberon's'' log reveals that the apes on board, led by Semos, organized a mutiny and  took over the vessel after it crashed. The human and ape survivors of the struggle left the ship and their descendants are the people Leo has encountered since landing. The apes arrive and attack the humans who have gathered to see Leo, although he is able to even the odds when he uses the ''Oberon''{{'}}s last fragments of fuel to fire a final blast at the first wave of apes. The battle stops when a familiar vehicle descends from the sky, which Leo immediately identifies as the pod piloted by Pericles, the chimpanzee astronaut who was pushed forward in time as Leo was and had just now found his way to the planet, the electromagnetic storm actually releasing people from it in an opposite direction in time to their entrance. When Pericles lands and the pod opens, the apes bow, interpreting his arrival as the return of Semos, and hostilities between humans and apes suddenly cease.\n\nPericles runs into the wreck of the ''Oberon'' and Leo runs after him, followed by General Thade. Thade and Leo fight. Pericles tries to help Leo, but Thade throws him hard against a wall. Thade takes Leo's gun from him and tries to fire it at Leo. Leo sees that Thade is within the pilot's deck and closes the automatic door, trapping Thade inside. Thade fires the gun repeatedly at the door but the ricochets create sparks that scare Thade, who huddles under a control panel. Deciding to escape Ashlar and return to Earth, Leo gives Pericles to Ari, who promises to look after him. After saying farewell to Ari and Daena, Leo climbs aboard Pericles's undamaged pod and travels back in time through the same electromagnetic storm, and crashes in [[Washington, D.C.]] on Earth. He looks up at what appears to be the [[Lincoln Memorial]], only to find that it is now a monument memorializing General Thade. A swarm of [[police officer]]s, [[firefighter]]s, and news [[reporter]]s descend upon him, revealed to all be apes.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Captain Leo Davidson<br />An [[astronaut]] who accidentally enters a portal to another world inhabited by talking humanoid [[ape]]s and is captured by them. Leo leads a rebellion of the planet's [[human]]s.

In 1988, Rifkin was brought in the studio to [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] ideas for films. Rifkin, being a fan of the 1968 ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' felt it was best to continue the film series. \"Having [[independent film]] experience, I promised I could write and direct a huge-looking film for a reasonable price and budget, like ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''.\"<ref name=\"Adam\" /> Fox commissioned Rifkin to write what amounted to a sequel, \"but not a sequel to [[Battle for the Planet of the Apes|the fifth film]], an alternate sequel to the first film\".<ref name=\"Adam\" /> He took influences from ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', with the storyline being \"the ape empire had reached its [[Roman Empire|Roman era]].

The project was abandoned until [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Fran Walsh]] pitched their own idea, with the apes going through a [[Renaissance]]. In the story, the ape government becomes concerned over the new art works, the humans are revolting and the liberal apes shelter a half-human, half-ape from the gorillas. [[Roddy McDowall]] was enthusiastic about their proposal and agreed to play the [[Leonardo da Vinci]]-type character they had written for him.

As producer Don Murphy put it, \"Terry wrote a ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' and Fox wanted ''[[The Flintstones]]''\".<ref name=\"Stone\" /> Fox studio executive Dylan Sellers felt the script could be improved by comedy. \"What if Robinson finds himself in Ape land and the Apes are trying to play [[baseball]]? But they're missing one element, like the [[pitcher]] or something.\" Sellers continued. \"Robinson knows what they're missing and he shows them, and they all start playing.\"<ref name=\"Stone\" /> Sellers refused to give up his baseball scene, and when Hayes turned in the next script, sans baseball, Sellers fired him. Dissatisfied with Sellers' decision to fire Hayes, Noyce left ''Return of the Apes'' in February 1995 to work on ''[[The Saint (1997 film)|The Saint]]''.<ref name=\"Noyce\" /><ref name=\"Stone\" />\n\n===Columbus and Cameron===\nStone pursued other films of his own, Chernin was replaced by [[Thomas Rothman]], and a drunken Sellers crashed his car, killing a much-loved colleague and earning jail time, while producers Murphy and Hamsher were paid off. \"After they got rid of us, they brought on [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]]\", Murphy stated. \"Then I heard they did tests of apes [[skiing]], which didn't make much sense.\"<ref name=\"Murph\">Hughes, p.41-43</ref> Stan Winston was still working on the makeup designs. Columbus brought [[Sam Hamm]], his co-writer on an unproduced ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' script, to write the screenplay. \"We tried to do a story that was simultaneously an homage to the elements we liked from the five films, and would also incorporate a lot of material [from [[Pierre Boulle]]'s novel] that had been jettisoned from the earlier production,\" Hamm continued. \"The first half of the script bore little resemblance to the book, but a lot of the stuff in the second half comes directly from it, or directly inspired by it.\"<ref name=\"Murph\" />\n\nHamm's script had an ape astronaut from another planet crash-landing in [[New York Harbor]], launching a virus that will make human beings extinct. Dr. Susan Landis, who works for the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], and Alexander Troy, an [[Area 51]] scientist, use the ape's spacecraft to return to the virus' planet of origin, hoping to find an antidote. They find an urban environment where apes armed with heavy weapons hunt humans. The main villain was Lord Zaius; in contrast to [[List of Planet of the Apes characters|Dr. Zaius]], Lord Zaius was very cruel to the humans. Landis and Troy discover the antidote and return to Earth, only to find in their 74-year absence that apes have taken over the planet. \"The [[Statue of Liberty]]'s once proud porcelain features have been crudely chiseled into the grotesque likeness of a great grinning ape\".<ref name=\"Murph\" />\n\nSchwarzenegger remained attached, but Fox had mixed emotions with Hamm's script.<ref name=\"Murph\" /> When Columbus dropped out in late 1995 to work on ''[[Jingle All the Way]]'', Fox offered the director's position to [[Roland Emmerich]] in January 1996.<ref name=\"Noyce\" /> [[James Cameron]] was in talks during the filming of ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' as writer and producer. Cameron's version would have drawn elements from the original film and its sequel ''[[Beneath the Planet of the Apes]]''. After the financial and critical success of ''Titanic'', Cameron dropped out.<ref name=\"Murph\" /> After learning about his previous involvement, Chernin and Rothman met with Peter Jackson to learn about his original Renaissance idea.

Geocaching was barely a year old at the time, and was just beginning to become more well known. The promotion's backstory, which actually had no connection to the movie, was that a group of renegade humans were placing artefacts (geocaches) around the globe in an effort to reveal an '''A'''lternate '''P'''rimate '''E'''volution. Over the course of several weeks in 2001, a cache containing props and memorabilia from the movie (prop [[blindfold]]s, prop knives, posters, trading cards and more)  was released every week. However, the cache's location was not given, but clues were given throughout the week that narrowed down the location until the cache's coordinates were released on a Friday. It was then a race to get to the cache, with the first person arriving at the location getting a pick of the goodies in the cache. The caches were large [[Ammunition box|ammo boxes]], with \"Project APE\" spray painted on the front. Fourteen caches were placed in a series of missions numbered 1\u201312 (one was \"Special Movie\" for the movie premiere in [[New York City|New York]] and there was a Mission 10a & 10b, with 10b being another cache with the [[London]] [[premiere]] tickets). Evidence points to a potential Mission 13, but no cache page has been found for it. Most of the caches did not last beyond a couple of finds, as most of them were muggled (stolen).
