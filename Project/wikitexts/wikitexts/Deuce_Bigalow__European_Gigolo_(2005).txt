The film is written by [[Rob Schneider]], [[David Garrett (screen writer)|David Garrett]], and Jason Ward, and starring Schneider, [[Eddie Griffin]], and [[Jeroen Krabb\u00e9]]. The plot involves [[Male prostitution|male prostitute]] Deuce Bigalow visiting his former pimp T.J. in [[Amsterdam]], and then finds himself looking for a murderer who is killing the greatest \"man-whores\" of Europe. Unlike ''Male Gigolo'', distributed by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[Touchstone Pictures]] brand, ''European Gigolo'' was released by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]] through [[Columbia Pictures]].\n\nThe film was panned by critics and was nominated for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]] at the [[26th Golden Raspberry Awards]], while Schneider won [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor|Worst Actor]]. It grossed $45 million on a $22 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Gigolo]]s in Europe are being terrorized by a serial killer. In [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], Deuce Bigalow has lost his wife Kate during a [[shark attack]] (he keeps her prosthetic leg with him in remembrance) and is invited by his former [[pimp]] friend T.J. Hicks to [[Amsterdam]] after Deuce accidentally causes an incident involving berserk dolphins. Deuce goes to take his mind off of Kate.\n\nAfter T.J. shows Deuce his boat, or \"float crib,\" the pair go to a [[Coffeeshop (Netherlands)|coffee shop]] where they get high and bump into Heinz Hummer, a German gigolo. After leaving the coffee shop, Deuce finds Hummer dead in an alley, but thinks he is merely stoned and takes the dead gigolo to T.J.'s float crib. When T.J. gets back, he immediately realizes that Hummer is dead. T.J. plans to dump the body, but skeptical of Hummer's reputation of being well-endowed, unzips his pants and examines his [[genitalia]] and is caught by a tour boat.\n\nUpon his release from the police station, Deuce finds T.J. at a restaurant and recalls that he saw the killer walking away from Hummer's body. Deuce says it was a woman, so they both figure it was a she-john, a former client of the murdered gigolo. T.J. convinces Deuce to find the killer by becoming a gigolo again, visiting the former clients and \"rooting\" out the killer. They attend a meeting of the Royal Order of European Man Whores, but fail to procure a list of the clients. Antoine, Deuce's client from the [[Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo|first film]] manages to get the list and gives to Deuce at a restaurant but is killed by the Man-Whore Killer, which is believed again to be T.J. when he is caught near Antoine's genitals.\n\nDeuce and T.J. visit the first client on the list. While Deuce distracts the woman, T.J. breaks into her residence and finds a brand of lipstick that might be the kind found on all the victims. After leaving, Deuce finds Inspector Gaspar Voorsbach on the street and shows him the lipstick. Gaspar throws the lipstick in the trash, mentioning that the lipstick found on the victims \"is a very rare one: Lavender Love #66\". As Gaspar enters the police station, his niece Eva approaches him and gives him his lunch. Eva slaps herself three times when Gaspar sneezes. Deuce helps her pick up the things she dropped and Eva explains to Deuce that she has [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]]. Deuce sees that she has a painting of a fish, so they go to the Amsterdam aquarium together. Deuce continues to investigate different women from Antoine's list. They include Lily, who speaks through an [[electrolarynx]] after a [[laryngectomy]], Svetlana Revenko, who has a penis for a nose as a result of being born and raised in [[Chernobyl]], Greta, a [[Germany|German]] hunchback and Louisa, a grimy [[Italy|Italian]] girl who becomes clean and beautiful again after Deuce throws her into a [[Venice]] canal and scrubs her. Eventually, Deuce and T.J. infiltrate the Man-Whore offices, where the Man-Whore Killer murders another gigolo and T.J. is arrested when he again is caught inadvertently holding the victim's charred penis.\n\nDeuce then visits Eva's apartment only to discover items used by the Man-Whore Killer. Believing the killer to be Eva, Deuce confides his suspicions to a wary Gaspar, who then reveals herself to Eva as the real Man-Whore Killer before locking her up as a fall girl. Deuce then rides with Gaspar to the Man-Whore Awards Ceremony under the guise of protecting the man-whores. But when Eva escapes and warns Deuce, Gaspar pulls a gun on Deuce and reveals that he is the real Man-Whore Killer. Gaspar tells Deuce that he was once a man-whore hopeful. While Gaspar was observing a demonstration on how to perform a certain sex act, the Portuguese Breakfast, one of his classmates offered to let him use his penis-enlargement pump. When the demonstration ended, Gaspar was horrified the demonstration was his [[Engagement|fianc\u00e9e]] Elsa. Gaspar was so angry and shocked that he continued to pump until his penis exploded, causing the other men to laugh at him. He blames man-whores for the loss of his fianc\u00e9e and his penis, and plans to kill them all at their awards ceremony.\n\nAt the ceremony, Deuce evacuates the building and gets into a sword fight with Gaspar, during which he mentions the other romantic ways of pleasing a woman; his words move the ladies in the crowd and the male gigolos. Gaspar beats Deuce, but before he can detonate the bomb, Lily and Svetlana distract Gaspar. Lily sprays alcohol all over him through her stoma and then Deuce knocks out Gaspar with a trophy taking the bomb detonator. For his bravery, Deuce is given the Golden Boner award. He shares a passionate kiss with Eva, and accidentally sets off the bomb when the statue's penis bumps the detonator button. Deuce and Eva leave the scene.\n\nThe following day, Deuce and Eva come to pick up T.J., who has been released from jail, and tells them that he is entering a brand new prostitution market: gay man-whoring.\n\nIn an epilogue: T.J. stops gay man-whoring and becomes a rapper. Deuce and Eva got married with Eva being pregnant. Gaspar is [[gang raped]] in prison. Svetlana marries a man with a vagina for a mouth in a wedding where everybody threw up. Kate's prosthetic leg is turned into a [[bong]] by an old Dutch woman.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as Deuce Bigalow, an [[Americans|American]] [[gigolo]] and the main protagonist.\n* [[Eddie Griffin]] as T.J.
