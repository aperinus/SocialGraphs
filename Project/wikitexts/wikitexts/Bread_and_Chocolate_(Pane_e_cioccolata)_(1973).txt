This film chronicles the misadventures of an Italian immigrant to Switzerland and is representative of the ''[[commedia all'italiana]]'' film genre.\n\n==Plot==\nLike many southern Europeans of the period (1960s to early 1970s), Nino Garofalo ([[Nino Manfredi]]) is a migrant \"[[Gastarbeiter|guest worker]]\" from [[Italy]], working as a waiter in [[Switzerland]]. He loses his work permit when he is caught urinating in public, so he begins to lead a clandestine life in Switzerland.\n\nAt first he is supported by Elena, a [[Greeks|Greek]] woman and [[political refugee]]. Then he is befriended by an Italian industrialist, relocated to Switzerland because of financial problems. The industrialist takes him under his wing and invests his savings for him, but kills himself after his financial scheme collapses, without having told Nino where he deposited his savings.\n\nNino is constrained to find shelter with a group of clandestine [[Naples|Neapolitans]] living in a chicken coop, together with the same chickens they tend to in order to survive.\n\nCharmed by the idyllic vision of a group of young blonde Swisses, having a bath in a river, he decides to dye his hair and pass himself off as a local. In a bar, when openly rooting for the [[Italian national football team]] during the broadcast of a match, he is found out as a migrant Italian worker, after [[Goal celebration|celebrating a goal]] scored by [[Fabio Capello]].\n\nHe is arrested and brought to a police station. He meets Elena again, who wants to give him a renewed permit but he refuses. He embarks on a train and finds himself in a cabin filled with returning Italian guest workers. Amid the songs of \"sun\" and \"sea\", he is seen having second thoughts.\n\nHe gets off at the first stop: better life as an illegal immigrant than a life of misery.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nino Manfredi]] as Nino Garofalo\n* [[Johnny Dorelli]] as Italian Industrialist\n* [[Anna Karina]] as Elena\n* [[Paolo Turco]] as Gianni\n* [[Ugo D'Alessio]] as Old Man\n* [[Tano Cimarosa]] as Giacomo\n* [[Gianfranco Barra]] as The Turk\n* [[Giorgio Cerioni]] as Police Inspector\n* [[Francesco D'Adda]] as Rudiger\n* [[Geoffrey Copleston]] as Boegli\n* [[Federico Scrobogna]] as Grigory\n* [[Max Delys]] as Renzo\n* [[Umberto Raho]] as Maitre\n* [[Nelide Giammarco]] as The Blonde\n* [[Manfred Freyberger]] as The Sportman\n\n==Reception==\n\nIn the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote:<blockquote>''Bread and Chocolate'' is a sneaky comedy that winds up being serious about its subject. It reminds us of some of [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]]'s later features, and maybe it's no coincidence that the lead character looks like Chaplin. He's a Southern Italian waiter named Nino (Nino Manfredi), who goes to Switzerland to tryout for a restaurant job and finds himself caught in a net of discrimination...\n\nThe only sympathy he gets comes from a neighbor (Anna Karina), a Greek immigrant who's concealing her child from the immigration authorities. Despondent, he goes into the country to find work on a chicken farm, and the film finds its best and most unforgettable image: a chicken-coop filled with immigrant laborers, who peer with admiration and envy through chicken wire at a crowd of Swiss kids frolicking in a pool.\n\nIt's here that we most completely feel the movie's underlying tension and seriousness. Other films have considered the dilemma of immigrant workers in Europe ... but not until this film by Franco Brusati has the subject been approached as a comedy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/bread-and-chocolate-1998|title=Bread and Chocolate|author=Roger Ebert|website=RogerEbert.com|publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=September 8, 1978}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Awards==\n* The film won several international awards including the [[Silver Bear]] at the [[24th Berlin International Film Festival]] in 1974.<ref name=\"berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1974/03_preistr_ger_1974/03_Preistraeger_1974.html |title=Berlinale 1974: Prize Winners |access-date=2010-07-04 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>\n* [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] 1978\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0070506}}\n* {{Amg movie|85891|Bread and Chocolate}}\n\n{{New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Foreign Language Film}}\n\n[[Category:1974 films]]\n[[Category:1974 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Commedia all'italiana]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Franco Brusati]]\n[[Category:1970s German-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Switzerland]]\n[[Category:Films about immigration]]\n[[Category:Italian comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1974 multilingual films]]\n[[Category:Italian multilingual films]]\n[[Category:1970s Italian films]]"}]}}}}
