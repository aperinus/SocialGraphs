It stars [[Orlando Bloom]], [[Eva Green]], [[Ghassan Massoud]], [[Jeremy Irons]], [[David Thewlis]], [[Brendan Gleeson]], [[Edward Norton]], [[Marton Csokas]], [[Liam Neeson]], [[Michael Sheen]], [[Velibor Topi\u0107]], and [[Alexander Siddig]].\n\nThe story is set during the [[Crusades]] of the 12th century. A [[France in the Middle Ages|French]] village [[blacksmith]] goes to the aid of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] in its defence against the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] [[Muslim]] [[Sultan]], [[Saladin]], who is fighting to claim back the city from the Christians; this leads to the [[Battle of Hattin]]. The screenplay is a heavily fictionalised portrayal of the life of [[Balian of Ibelin]] (c. 1143\u201393).\n\nFilming took place in [[Ouarzazate]], [[Morocco]], where Scott had previously filmed ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' (2000) and ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'' (2001), and in Spain, at the [[Loarre Castle]] ([[Province of Huesca|Huesca]]), [[Segovia]], [[\u00c1vila, Spain|\u00c1vila]], [[Palma del R\u00edo]], and [[Seville]]'s [[Casa de Pilatos]] and [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville|Alc\u00e1zar]].<ref>Cinemareview.com: [http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=2960 \"Kingdom of Heaven \u2013 Production Notes\"]</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Kingdom of Heaven (2005)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0320661/locations|work=IMDb|access-date=11 March 2018}}</ref> The film was released on May 6, 2005, by [[20th Century Fox]] and received mixed reviews upon theatrical release. It grossed $218 million worldwide. On 23 December 2005, Scott released a [[director's cut]], which received critical acclaim, with many reviewers calling it the definitive version of the film.<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/><ref name=\"Reviewers\"/>\n\n== Plot ==\n\nIn [[France in the Middle Ages|1184 France]], [[Balian of Ibelin|Balian]], a [[blacksmith]], is haunted by his wife's recent suicide, after the death of their unborn child. A Crusader passing through the village introduces himself as Balian's father, Baron Godfrey of [[House of Ibelin|Ibelin]], and asks him to return with him to the [[Holy Land]], but Balian declines. After the town priest (Balian's half-brother) reveals that he ordered Balian's wife's body beheaded before burial, Balian inspects the priest thoroughly, noticing the priest had stolen his wife's necklace and kills him before fleeing the village.\n\nBalian joins his father, hoping to gain forgiveness and redemption for himself and his wife in [[Jerusalem]]. Soldiers sent by the bishop arrive to arrest Balian, but Godfrey refuses to surrender him, and in the ensuing attack, Godfrey is struck by an arrow that breaks off in his body.\n\nIn [[Messina]], they have a contentious encounter with [[Guy de Lusignan]], prospective future king of Jerusalem. Godfrey knights Balian, names him the new Baron of Ibelin, and orders him to serve the [[King of Jerusalem]] and protect the helpless, then succumbs to his arrow wound and dies. During the journey to Jerusalem, Balian's ship runs aground in a storm, leaving him as the only survivor. Balian is confronted by a Muslim cavalier, who attacks in a fight for his horse. Balian is forced to slay the cavalier but spares his servant, who tells him that this mercy will gain him fame and respect among the [[Saracens]].\n\nBalian becomes acquainted with Jerusalem's political arena: the [[leper]] King [[Baldwin IV]]; [[Raymond III, Count of Tripoli|Tiberias]], the Marshal of Jerusalem; the King's sister, [[Sibylla, Queen of Jerusalem|Princess Sibylla]], who is Guy's wife and also mother to a little boy from an earlier marriage. Guy supports the anti-Muslim brutalities of the Knights Templar and intends to break the fragile truce between the King and the sultan [[Saladin]] to make war on the Muslims. Balian travels to his inherited estate at Ibelin and finds the residents struggling and the land almost barren from lack of water. He quickly gets to work, using his knowledge of engineering to irrigate the dry and dusty lands, while working right alongside the workers. The land quickly turns into lush farmland which both improves the residents' lives and earns Balian the love and respect of his people. During that time Sibylla visits him and watches him as he interacts with his tenants, and they become lovers.\n\nIn 1185 Guy and his ally, the cruel [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]], attack a Saracen caravan, and Saladin advances on Raynald's castle [[Siege of Kerak|Kerak]] in retaliation. At the king's request, Balian defends the villagers, despite being overwhelmingly outnumbered. Captured, Balian encounters the servant he had freed, who he learns is actually Saladin's chancellor [[Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani|Imad ad-Din]]. Imad ad-Din releases Balian in repayment of his earlier mercy. Saladin arrives with a massive army to besiege Kerak, and Baldwin meets them with his own. They negotiate a Muslim retreat, and Baldwin swears to punish Raynald, though the exertion of these events weakens him.\n\nBaldwin asks Balian to marry Sibylla and take control of the army, but Balian refuses, much to Sybilla's & Tiberius' dismay, because it will require the execution of Guy and the Templars. Baldwin soon dies and is succeeded by his nephew, Sybilla's son, now [[Baldwin V]]. Sybilla, as regent, intends to maintain her brother's peace with Saladin. Shortly, her son, like his uncle before him, begins to develop leprosy. Devastated and driven by the common belief of eternal damnation for lepers, Sybilla makes the heartrending decision to end her son's life by pouring poison into his ear while he sleeps in her arms; she then hands the crown to her husband Guy and withdraws in private to mourn.\n\nAs King of Jerusalem, Guy releases Raynald, who gives him the war he desires by murdering Saladin's sister. Sending the severed heads of Saladin's emissaries back to him, Guy declares war on the Saracens in 1187 and attempts to assassinate Balian, who barely survives. Guy marches to war with the army, despite Balian's advice to remain near Jerusalem's water sources. The Saracens later annihilate the tired and dehydrated Crusaders in [[Battle of Hattin|the ensuing desert battle]]. Saladin takes Guy captive, executes Raynald, and marches on Jerusalem. Tiberias leaves for [[Cyprus]], believing Jerusalem lost, but Balian remains to protect the people in the city, and knights every fighting man to inspire them. After an [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|assault that lasts three days]], a frustrated Saladin parleys with Balian. When Balian reaffirms that he will destroy the city if Saladin does not accept his surrender, Saladin agrees to allow the Christians to leave safely. They ponder if it would be better if the city were destroyed, as there would be nothing left to fight over.\n\nIn the city, Balian is confronted by the humiliated Guy, and defeats him in a sword fight, though he spares Guy's life, telling him to \"rise a knight\" as if he never were. In the marching column of citizens, Balian finds Sibylla, who has renounced her claim as queen. After they return to France, English knights en route [[Third Crusade|to Jerusalem]] ride through the town to enlist Balian, now the famed defender of Jerusalem. Balian tells [[Richard I of England|the crusader]] that he is merely a blacksmith again, and they depart. Balian is joined by Sibylla, and they pass by the grave of Balian's wife as they ride toward the unknown. An epilogue notes that \"nearly a thousand years later, peace in the Kingdom of Heaven still remains elusive\".\n\n== Cast ==\nMany of the characters in the film are fictionalised versions of historical figures:\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Orlando Bloom]] as [[Balian of Ibelin]]\n* [[Eva Green]] as [[Sibylla of Jerusalem]]\n* [[Jeremy Irons]] as [[Raymond III of Tripoli]] (\u201cTiberias\u201d)\n* [[David Thewlis]] as [[Knights Hospitaller|The Hospitaller]]\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]] (\u201cReynald\u201d)\n* [[Marton Csokas]] as [[Guy of Lusignan|Guy de Lusignan]]\n* [[Edward Norton]] as [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|King Baldwin IV of Jerusalem]]\n* [[Michael Sheen]] as Priest\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Barisan of Ibelin]] (\u201cGodfrey\u201d)\n* [[Velibor Topi\u0107]] as Amalric\n* [[Ghassan Massoud]] as [[Saladin]]\n* [[Alexander Siddig]] as [[Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani]]\n* [[Khaled El Nabawy|Khaled Nabawy]] as [[Mullah]]\n* [[Kevin McKidd]] as English Sergeant\n* [[Michael Shaeffer]] as Young Sergeant\n* [[Jon Finch]] as [[Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem]]\n* [[Ulrich Thomsen]] as [[Gerard de Ridefort]] (\u201cTemplar Master\u201d)\n* [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as Village Sheriff\n* [[Martin Hancock]] as Gravedigger\n* [[Nathalie Cox]] as Balian's Wife\n* [[Eriq Ebouaney]] as Firuz\n* [[Jouko Ahola]] as Odo\n* [[Giannina Facio]] as Saladin's sister\n* [[Philip Glenister]] as Squire\n* [[Bronson Webb]] as Apprentice\n* [[Steven Robertson]] as Angelic Priest\n*[[Iain Glen]] as [[Richard I of England]] (Richard Coeur de Lion)\n* [[Angus Wright (actor)|Angus Wright]] as Richard's Knight\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Oliver Mark - Ridley Scott, Berlin 2005.jpg|thumb|Director Ridley Scott in 2005]]\n\n=== Cinematography ===\nThe visual style of ''Kingdom of Heaven'' emphasises set design and impressive cinematography in almost every scene.

Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 39% based on reviews from 191 critics, with an average rating of 5.60/10.

[[Historiography of the Crusades|Historians of the Crusades]] such as [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]], quoted by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', described the film as \"dangerous to [[Arab]] relations\", calling the film \"[[Osama bin Laden]]'s version of history,\" which would \"fuel the [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalists]]\". Riley-Smith further commented against the historical accuracy, stating that \"the fanaticism of most of the Christians in the film and their hatred of Islam is what the Islamists want to believe. At a time of inter-faith tension, nonsense like this will only reinforce existing myths\", arguing that the film relied on the romanticized view of the Crusades propagated by [[Sir Walter Scott]] in his book ''[[The Talisman (Scott novel)|The Talisman]]'', published in 1825 and now discredited by academics, \"which depicts the Muslims as sophisticated and civilized, and the Crusaders are all brutes and barbarians.

If you've got a lunatic doing my job, then you need to preview. But a good director should be experienced enough to judge what he thinks is the correct version to go out into the cinema.\"<ref name=\"totalfilm\">''Total Film'' magazine, July 2006: 'Three hours, eight minutes. It's beautiful.' (Interview to promote ''Kingdom of Heaven: The Director's Cut'')</ref>\n\nSignificant subplots were added as well as enhanced character relationships. The priest Balian kills at the beginning of the film is revealed to be his half-brother, while the lord presiding over Balian's hometown is revealed to be Godfrey's brother. Battle scenes are depicted with more violence than in the theatrical cut. More scenes with the Hospitaller offering guidance to Balian were added back in. The most significant addition was the subplot involving Sybilla's son Baldwin V, who becomes the first to inherit the throne of Jerusalem following the passing of Baldwin IV, but is shown to be afflicted with leprosy just like his uncle before him, so Sybilla peacefully poisons him to prevent him from suffering as his predecessor did. The gravedigger from Balian's hometown is given more attention: he is shown to be philosophical at the beginning of the film, and is shown to follow Balian to Jerusalem to seek salvation like Balian, who acknowledges his presence and personally knights him before the final siege. Finally, a final fight is shown between Balian and Guy, where Balian wins but spares Guy, leaving him dishonored.\n\n== Historical accuracy ==\n\nScott, possibly anticipating criticism of historical accuracy, said: \"Story books are what we base our movies on, and what we base our characters on.\"<ref name=\"Francaviglia\">{{cite book|title=Lights, Camera, History: Portraying the Past in Film|first=Richard V.|last=Francaviglia|editor-first=Jerry|editor-last=Rodnitzky|year=2007|pages=79|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|isbn=978-1585445806}}</ref> The story of Balian of Ibelin was heavily fictionalized; the historical Balian was not a French artisan but a prominent lord in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. The characters of Godfrey of Ibelin and the Hospitaller were wholly invented, while the stories of others were \"tweaked\"; for example, [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]]'s responsibility for the Christian defeat is downplayed in order to make Guy \"more of an autonomous villain\".<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\nThe historical Sibylla was devoted to Guy, but the filmmakers wanted the character to be \"stronger and wiser\".<ref name=\"Smith\">{{cite book|title=Kingdom of Heaven: The Ridley Scott Film and the History Behind the Story|first=J.
