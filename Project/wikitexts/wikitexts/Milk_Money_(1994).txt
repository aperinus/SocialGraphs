The film is about three suburban 11-year-old boys who find themselves behind in \"the battle of the sexes,\" believing they would regain the upper hand if they could just see a real, live naked lady.\n\nThe film received generally negative reviews from critics.\n\n== Plot ==\nThree [[junior high school]] boys\u2014Brad ([[Adam LaVorgna]]), Frank (Michael Patrick Carter) and Kevin (Brian Christopher)\u2014travel from their bedroom suburb of Middleton to the city, bringing money with hopes of seeing a woman naked. They find a [[Prostitute|hooker]] named \"V\" ([[Melanie Griffith]]) who is willing to show her breasts. However, when they decide to head home, they find their bikes have been stolen, leaving them broke and stuck in the city. V speaks with her drug dealing pimp named \"Cash\" ([[Casey Siemaszko]]), and another hooker, Betty ([[Anne Heche]]). Cash has been skimming money that he sends to mob collector Waltzer ([[Malcolm McDowell]]), who in turn steals from his own boss, Jerry \"The Pope\" ([[Philip Bosco]]). V notices the boys outside in the rain and offers them a ride back home in Cash's car.\n\nAfter they arrive at Frank's house, the car V was using suddenly breaks down so she goes inside to use the phone. Tom ([[Ed Harris]]), Frank's father, comes home and is surprised to find a woman in the house. Unbeknownst to V, Frank tells Tom that V is a math [[tutor]] and that she's giving lessons to Brad. Tom offers to repair her car in a few days when he is free from his science classes at school. With no other option, she accepts Frank's offer to stay in his [[tree house]] without Tom's knowledge. Frank begins a close friendship with V, hoping to set her up with his father. He tells her Tom has no problem with her \"job,\" meaning the tutoring ruse, but she thinks he means her [[prostitution]].\n\nV learns from television that Cash has been murdered by Waltzer. She phones Betty only to discover that Waltzer is looking for her - Cash told him that she stole the money. She realizes that he is overhearing the conversation and hangs up. With V's car still broken down, she gets Tom's old bike from the garage and rushes to find him. He is on a field trip to the town's [[wetlands]], undeveloped natural land that he is attempting to save from development. He is unable to repair her car any sooner, but she realizes that she is probably safer in Middleton, since Waltzer doesn't know where she is.\n\nAt school, Frank flunks a biology test about sex education and must give his class an oral presentation. He decides to use V as a mannequin and through a ruse distracts his teacher long enough to draw a relatively accurate female reproductive system on her skin-colored bodysuit. Tom and V go out on a date and both realize they are developing feelings for each other. While walking through town on their date, Tom and V run into Kevin's family. V recognizes Kevin's father, who is a client, but he initially says she has him mixed up with someone else before admitting to remembering her and says she was a dance teacher. Tom is impressed with how busy V is being a tutor and dance teacher; V then realizes that Frank had actually lied about Tom knowing about her prostitution. V explains herself to Tom, and their relationship grows. She reveals that her real name is Eve, which she thought was too biblical so she removed the \u201ce\u201ds. Kevin's father unwittingly calls her home phone number, which he had in his pocket notebook, in an attempt to purchase her services again. He talks to Betty; and Waltzer, who happens to be there also, learns from Betty about the trip to Middleton, thus finding out where V is hiding.\n\nV is terrified that Waltzer will find her so she decides to leave town but attends a school dance to say goodbye to Frank. Waltzer shows up to spoil their fun. A chase ensues, with Waltzer finally being eliminated. Anxious about her status and afraid to return to her old job, V goes to Waltzer's boss and relates how he has been cheating him. She asks to be \"forgotten\" by them. The older crime boss succumbs to her charms and he tells her he'll take care of things and that she doesn't need to be afraid anymore, while also allowing her to walk away from prostitution for good. V finds the stolen money in a backpack and uses it to buy the wetlands in Tom's name; it is also revealed that she purchased the ice cream parlor in town, so she can carry on with her new relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Melanie Griffith]] as Eve \"V\"\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Tom Wheeler\n* Michael Patrick Carter as Frank Wheeler\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as Waltzer\n* [[Anne Heche]] as Betty\n* [[Philip Bosco]] as Jerry \"The Pope\"\n* [[Casey Siemaszko]] as \"Cash\"\n* Brian Christopher as Kevin\n* [[Adam LaVorgna]] as Brad\n* [[Margaret Nagle]] as Mrs. Fetch\n* [[Kevin Youkilis]] as Kid (uncredited)\n\n== Production ==\nThe screenplay written by [[John Mattson]] was sold to [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1992 for $1.1 million, a record for a romantic comedy [[spec script]]. Mattson was sued by [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group|Dino De Laurentiis]] (DDLC); the lawsuit alleged that Mattson's agent had made a verbal agreement to sell the script to DDLC for $1 million, before selling the script to Paramount for $1.1 million.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eller |first1=Claudia |title=De Laurentiis wont take 'Milk' sale lying down |url=https://variety.com/1992/more/news/de-laurentiis-wont-take-milk-sale-lying-down-100046/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=17 November 1992}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=25 November 1992 |last=Eller |first=Claudia |title=DDLC tightens budget belt |url=https://variety.com/1992/film/news/ddlc-tightens-budget-belt-101581/ |website=Variety }}</ref> \nThe film was originally set up with [[Joe Dante]] to direct and his frequent partner, [[Michael Finnell]], to produce, but they left the project over disputes regarding the budget and their fees.
