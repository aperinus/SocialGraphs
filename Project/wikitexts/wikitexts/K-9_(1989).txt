It was directed by [[Rod Daniel]], written by Steven Siegel and Scott Myers, produced by [[Lawrence Gordon (producer)|Lawrence Gordon]] and Charles Gordon, and released by [[Universal Pictures]].\n\nBelushi plays bad-tempered [[San Diego]] police detective Michael Dooley, who has been tagged for [[Execution (legal)|execution]] by a major international [[drug lord|drug dealer]] named Ken Lyman (played by [[Kevin Tighe]]). To help, K-9 Sergeant Brannigan (played by [[Ed O'Neill]]) gives Dooley an unorthodox drug-sniffing [[police dog]] called \"Jerry Lee\" (named after rock-and-roll singer [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]).<ref name=\"LATimes\">{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-28/entertainment/ca-1646_1_jerry-lee-k-9-movie-reviews |title=Movie Reviews : 'K-9' a Serviceable Outing for Belushi |first=Kevin |last=Thomas |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 28, 1989 |access-date=Aug 21, 2012}}</ref> The duo attempt to put Lyman behind bars but Dooley quickly learns Jerry Lee is a mischievous smart aleck who works only when and how he wants to. Many of the film's gags revolve around Jerry Lee's playfully destructive episodes.\n\nThe film was followed by a [[K-9 (film series)|''K-9'' film series]], including two direct-to-video sequels, ''[[K-911]]'' (1999) and ''[[K-9: P.I.]]'' (2002); as well as a television spin-off film titled ''[[K-9000]]'', that was intended to be the pilot episode to a TV series that was not ordered.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please see [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before expanding the plot. Plots must be under 700 words. Current length: 653 words. -->\nSan Diego Police Detective Michael Dooley leaves his unmarked police car to contact his girlfriend, Tracy, when a helicopter suddenly appears and opens fire on his car, which ignites. Presuming him dead, the assassins leave the scene. At the police station, Dooley argues with his lieutenant about the other night, refusing to take a partner; instead, he decides to get a police dog. At home, he finds Tracy with another man and spends the night in his personal car, a classic 1966 [[Ford Mustang]] convertible (he refers to it as a \"'65\"). The next day, Dooley coerces Freddie, an informant, into revealing that Ken Lyman, the drug lord Dooley has been after for two years, is responsible for the attack. Dooley is assigned a German Shepherd named \"[[Jerry Lee]]\",<ref name=\"LATimes\"/> whom he dislikes.\n\nDooley and Jerry Lee head to a warehouse assumed to be filled with drugs. When Jerry Lee ignores Dooley's orders, the workers laugh at him. Dooley is forced to leave after Jerry Lee finds only a marijuana joint when commanded to find drugs. The duo drive to a pub where Dooley stakes out Benny the Mule in an attempt to charge Lyman. When his cover is blown, Jerry Lee saves Dooley from a beating; with the dog's help, Dooley subdues Benny and learns the location of Lyman's next shipment. Meanwhile, Lyman kills Freddie and demands that his henchman Dillon kill Dooley before the shipment arrives.\n\nAt Dooley's apartment, Jerry Lee steals the spotlight after Tracy accepts Dooley's story that he rescued the dog from the streets. The next day, Dooley and Jerry Lee bond when they eat together and spy on Lyman. The two are nearly killed when someone shoots at them, and the two chase the assailant to an empty building. Jerry Lee leads Dooley to the man, who falls to his death after a fistfight with Dooley. In the man's car, Dooley finds a clue that leads him to an auto-dealer shop. There, Jerry Lee identifies a red Mercedes owned by Lyman, and Dooley learns from Halstead, the owner of the dealership, that he works for Lyman. Later, Jerry Lee falls in love with a poodle to the disapproval of its owner.\n\nWhen Dooley returns home, he discovers Lyman has kidnapped Tracy. Infuriated, Dooley crashes a party  at Lyman's mansion and demands her return. Lyman pretends to know nothing, and Dooley is arrested by an officer from his own department and put in a squad car. Angry, Dooley's lieutenant calls him crazy.  When Jerry Lee's flatulence annoys the other officers, Dooley uses it to his advantage and escapes with the dog. As Dooley tells Jerry Lee how he met Tracy, he spots a truck driven by Halstead that is pulling a trailer with Lyman's Mercedes. Dooley purses the truck, and Halstead blows a tire. After Halstead shoots at Dooley, Jerry Lee stopped Halstead and arrested.\n\nMeanwhile, in a stranded desert in San Diego, Lyman holds Tracy hostage in his limo and becomes suspicious when Halstead is late. Dooley arrives with the truck and trailer, which is revealed to be the next shipment of drugs. Not worrying about the case anymore, Dooley orders Lyman to surrender his girlfriend to him, or he will blow up the truck. Lyman calls Dooley's bluff, and a shootout ensues.  Dooley kills Lyman's henchmen Dillon and Jerry Lee chases Lyman as he runs for his helicopter. Unable to outrun the dog, Lyman shoots Jerry Lee; enraged, Dooley shoots at Lyman but misses.  Lyman is, instead, shot and killed by his associates who were waiting in the helicopter. Dooley and Tracy rush Jerry Lee to a hospital, where the reluctant surgeon operates. In the recovery room, Dooley delivers a eulogy to Jerry Lee, not knowing that he is alive. When the surgeon tells him he is going to be fine, Dooley responds in anger, thinking he was speaking to a dead dog. Jerry Lee licks Dooley's face out of love, making him give in.\n\nTo take a break from police work, Dooley, Tracy, Jerry Lee, and a poodle spend a vacation together in Las Vegas.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jim Belushi]] as Detective Michael Dooley<ref name=LATimes/><!-- Per the review, his first name is \"Tom\", not \"Michael\" -->\n* [[Mel Harris]] as Tracy\n* [[Kevin Tighe]] as Lyman\n* [[Ed O'Neill]] as [[Police dog|K-9]] Sergeant Brannigan\n* [[James Handy]] as Lieutenant Byers\n* [[Sherman Howard]] as Dillon\n* [[Daniel Davis]] as Halstead\n* [[Cotter Smith]] as Gilliam\n* [[John Snyder (actor)|John Snyder]] as Freddie\n* [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] as Benny 'The Mule'\n* [[Marjorie Bransfield]] as Car Dealership Reciptionist\n* [[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]] as Don, Car Salesman\n{{div col end}}\nThe role of \"Jerry Lee\", though credited in the movie credits as being played by Jerry Lee, was actually played by more than one dog, including [[Extra (actor)|backups]] and [[stand-in]]s.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20120355,00.html|title=Get Used to It, Cybill\u2014there's a New Shepherd in Hollywood|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|author1=Neill, Michael |author2=Marie Moneysmith |date=1989-05-22|access-date=2011-12-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-12-11/magazine/tm-21_1_hollywood-animal-trainers-explain/6|title=The Cruelty Question : How Do They Get a Horse to Flip Flapjacks, an Elephant to Ring for Champagne, a Chimpanzee to Sit Still?
