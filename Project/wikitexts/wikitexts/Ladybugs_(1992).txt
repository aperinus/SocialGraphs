Furie]]. Dangerfield plays a [[Denver]] businessman who takes over a girls soccer team that the company he works for sponsors. The film also stars [[Jack\u00e9e Harry]] as his assistant coach, [[Ilene Graff]] as his girlfriend, [[Jonathan Brandis]] as his girlfriend's son, and [[Vinessa Shaw]] as his boss' daughter.\n\nThen [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] manager [[Tommy Lasorda]] has a cameo, as do [[Blake Clark]] and longtime Dangerfield friend [[Chuck McCann]].\n\n== Plot ==\nChester Lee ([[Rodney Dangerfield]]) is desperate for a promotion at work and some respect from his boss. To impress his boss, he claims to have been a good soccer player in his youth and is badgered into coaching a girls' team called the [[Ladybug]]s. Dragging his assistant Julie ([[Jack\u00e9e Harry]]) along as assistant coach, Chester figures the gig easy as the Ladybugs, sponsored by his company, are a [[dynasty (sports)|dynasty]], having dominated previous seasons. If he can get this team to a championship, he will get the promotion. Unfortunately, only one player has returned for the new season. The new team, which includes the boss' daughter, Kimberly ([[Vinessa Shaw]]), are clueless, make a dreadful start to the season and the boss is less than impressed.\n\nIn his personal life, Chester is engaged to Bess ([[Ilene Graff]]), who has a son, Matthew ([[Jonathan Brandis]]), from a previous marriage. Matthew just happens to be a great athlete, but poor grades get him kicked off the soccer team. Chester invites Matthew to watch the Ladybugs practice and to get some tips. Matthew has a crush on Kimberly from school, which partly inspires Chester to persuade him to dress like a girl and play for the team as \"Martha\". With only Chester, Matthew and Julie knowing Martha's secret identity, the team rallies through the season to reach the championship game. Kimberly befriends Martha, not knowing \"she\" is in fact Matthew.\n\nJust before the championship game, Bess finds out that Matthew has been dressing as a girl to play. Furious with Chester, she forces him to drop Matthew from the team. Kimberly, who has not been playing well, is also dropped at the request of Chester's boss.\n\nThe Ladybugs trail 3-0 in the first half. At halftime, Matthew reveals his true identity to Kimberly and the rest of his teammates. His honesty fires the team up and with Chester's encouragement, Kimberly scores the winning goal on a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]. As the Ladybugs win the championship, Chester gets his promotion. Bess and Chester get married while Matthew and Kimberly begin dating.  Chester is now managing the company's girls softball team, where the entire team are boys dressed as girls. After his boss congratulates him on his success, Chester says to the audience, \"I finally got some respect!\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rodney Dangerfield]] as Coach Chester Lee\n* [[Jack\u00e9e Harry]] as Julie Benson \n* [[Jonathan Brandis]] as Matthew/Martha\n* [[Ilene Graff]] as Bess\n* [[Vinessa Shaw]] as Kimberly Mullen\n* [[Tom Parks]] as Dave Mullen\n* [[Randall May]] as Championship Soccer trainer\n* [[Jeanetta Arnette]] as Glynnis Mullen\n* [[Crystal Cooke]] as Nancy Larimer (as LaCrystal Cooke)\n* [[Jennifer Frances Lee]] as Carmelita Chu\n* [[Vanessa Monique Rossel]] as Tina Velez\n* [[Johna Stewart-Bowden]] as Sally Anne Welfelt (as Johna Stewart)\n* [[Jandi Swanson]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://player.fm/series/pretty-funny-girl-podcast/all-things-ladybugs-an-interview-with-penny-pester-jandi-swanson|title=All Things Ladybugs!
