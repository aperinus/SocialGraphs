The [[VHS]] was recorded during a performance in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], United States. However, the tour was a global one. During this tour Izzard also wrote the book ''Dress to Kill'' with David Quantick (photographs by Steve Double), published by [[Virgin Books]] in hardback in 1998 and paperback in 2000.\n\nIzzard's humour includes observations on the American concept of history, beginning with her quote \"I grew up in [[Europe]], where the history comes from\" and continuing through diversions about the belief that all Europeans live in [[castle]]s (\"we just long for a [[bungalow]] or something\") and the attitude of Americans toward historical landmarks. Additionally, Izzard takes time to explain her background as an ''executive'' [[Transvestism|transvestite]] and how it affected her desire to join the [[military]]. This is explained through a proposal for the Army's \"first battalion transvestite brigade...with ''fantastic'' [[Cosmetics|makeup]] and a fantastic gun.\"\n\nThe centerpiece of the performance is a retelling of British history from [[Stonehenge]] through to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. This is done with Izzard adopting a very [[Italy|Italian]] accent (and miming riding on a [[Vespa]]) to signify the [[Pope]] talking to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] (\"who is [[Sean Connery]] for this film\") and explaining that he can't marry as many wives as he wants to. This is set against the backdrop of [[Martin Luther]] pinning his 95 Theses on the door of [[Wittenberg|Wittenberg Cathedral]], a paper that reads \"Eine Minuten bitte. Ich habe einen kleinen Problemo avec diese Religione.\" \"He was from everywhere,\" explains Izzard to great cheers from the audience. Similar to her use of [[Sean Connery]] as the voice of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], she uses the voice of [[James Mason]] as the voice of God.\n\nIzzard, a self-proclaimed film buff, also describes the plot of ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' in a semi-improvised manner. She is particularly fond of [[Steve McQueen]]'s role in the film, and goes to great lengths to explain how inaccurate his escape through Central Europe actually is (\"within fifteen minutes he's on the borders of Switzerland. This is from Poland! And if you don't know the geography, it goes [[Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Netherlands|Holland]], [[Venezuela]], [[Africa]], [[Beirut]], the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]], and then Switzerland.\").\n\nDiversions are also made in relation to the [[Heimlich maneuver]] and the [[American Dream]], while the performance ends with Izzard re-telling the story of how she didn't lose her [[virgin]]ity. An encore is then performed, featuring Izzard delivering the plot of the film ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' in French and explaining how her schoolboy French, (\"la souris est sous la table, le chat est sur la chaise, et le singe est sur la branche\") serves her in France itself.\n\nOne of Izzard's most well-known routines was performed during ''Dress To Kill'': a satirical depiction of [[Church of England]] [[fundamentalism]], wherein Izzard explains how Church of England fundamentalism would be impossible because people would be shouting out \"You must have tea and cake with the vicar or you DIE!\" and \"CAKE OR DEATH?!\" The latter phrase has become so well known that it is now the name of an Eddie Izzard fansite and has inspired a Christian website called ''Anglican Memes'' for those who  \"like gentle fun being poked at the church but are not interested in church-bashing or posting anything offensive.\"<ref>[http://anglicanmemes.com/about/ Anglican Memes]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.eddieizzard.com/eddie/stand-up/view.php?Id=1 Dress to Kill] - article at The Official Eddie Izzard Site\n* {{IMDb title|id=0184424|title=Eddie Izzard: Dress to Kill}}\n* [http://www.auntiemomo.com/cakeordeath/ The Cake or Death Site]\n\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:Eddie Izzard albums]]\n[[Category:Stand-up comedy albums]]\n[[Category:Films shot in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Spoken word albums by English artists]]\n[[Category:Stand-up comedy concert films]]"}]}}}}
