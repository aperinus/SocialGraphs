The screenplay by Colin Patrick Lynch focuses on two individuals whose relationship slowly evolves from lust to friendship to romance over the course of seven years.\n\n==Plot==\nConstructed as a series of chapters that take place at a turning point in each character's life, the story moves from seven years in the past, to three years, to two, and finally arrives in the present day. Emily Friehl and Oliver Martin's first encounter is on a flight from Los Angeles to New York City. He has hopes of becoming an Internet entrepreneur and, certain of his future success, gives her his mother's phone number and suggests she call him in six years to see if his prediction came true.\n\nThree years later, facing the prospect of spending New Year's Eve alone, Emily finds Oliver's number and calls him, and the two meet for dinner. Thus starts a series of reunions with the passing of time, as each drifts in and out of relationships with others, Oliver and his business partner Jeeter start an on-line diaper service, and Emily becomes a successful photographer. Each time they meet, one appears to be settled and content while the other is struggling to make headway in both life and career. Eventually, they come to the realization that each is exactly the person the other one needs for fulfillment. A few years later, Emily gets engaged, but she still has feelings for Oliver. Her sister later sees him at the drapers thinking that he's getting married. Upset, Emily goes to track down Oliver who asks her what is she doing here. The movie ends where Oliver says it's always gonna be you.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ashton Kutcher]] as Oliver Martin\n*[[Amanda Peet]] as Emily Friehly\n*[[Kathryn Hahn]] as Michelle\n*[[Kal Penn]] as Jeeter\n*[[Ali Larter]] as Gina\n*[[Taryn Manning]] as Ellen Martin\n*[[Tyrone Giordano]] as Graham Martin\n*[[Amy Aquino]] as Diane Martin\n*[[Gabriel Mann (actor)|Gabriel Mann]] as Peter\n*[[Jeremy Sisto]] as Ben Miller\n*[[Moon Bloodgood]] as Bridget\n*[[Sam Pancake]] as Hipster at Party\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in New York City, Los Angeles, and [[Antelope Valley]].\n\n===Music===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = A Lot like Love (Music from the Motion Picture)\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|2005|4|12}}\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Columbia Records]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nA soundtrack album for the film was released by [[Columbia Records]] on April 12, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrackinfo.com/OST/lotlikelove/|title=SoundtrackINFO: A Lot Like Love Soundtrack|access-date=2013-08-01}}</ref><ref name=\"iTunes\">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/lot-like-love-music-from-motion/id405585373 |title=A Lot Like Love (Music from the Motion Picture) by Various Artists |date=April 12, 2005 |publisher=[[iTunes]] |access-date=August 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Track list====\n{{tracklist\n| extra_column = Artists\n| title1       = [[Semi-Charmed Life]]\n| extra1       = [[Third Eye Blind]]\n| length1      = 4:27\n| title2       = [[Walkin' on the Sun]]\n| extra2       = [[Smash Mouth]]\n| length2      = 3:25\n| title3       = [[Save Tonight]]\n| extra3       = [[Eagle Eye Cherry]]\n| length3      = 3:52\n| title4       = [[Mint Car]]\n| extra4       = [[The Cure]]\n| length4      = 3:29\n| title5       = [[Mad About You (Hooverphonic song)|Mad About You]]\n| extra5       = [[Hooverphonic]]\n| length5      = 3:43\n| title6       = [[Trouble (Ray LaMontagne song)|Trouble]]\n| extra6       = [[Ray Lamontagne]]\n| length6      = 3:59\n| title7       = Know Nothing\n| extra7       = [[Travis (band)|Travis]]\n| length7      = 2:59\n| title8       = [[If You Leave Me Now]]\n| extra8       = [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]\n| length8      = 3:56\n| title9       = [[Brighter Than Sunshine]]\n| extra9       = [[Aqualung (musician)|Aqualung]]\n| length9      = 4:01\n| title10      = Hands of Time\n| extra10      = [[Groove Armada]]\n| length10     = 4:21\n| title11      = [[Look What You've Done]]\n| extra11      = [[Jet (band)|Jet]]\n| length11     = 3:50\n| title12      = [[Breathe (2 AM)]]\n| extra12      = [[Anna Nalick]]\n| length12     = 4:39\n| title13      = Maybe It's Just Me\n| extra13      = [[Butch Walker]]\n| length13     = 3:20\n}}\n\n==Critical reception==\n''A Lot like Love'' received mixed reviews. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a rating of 41%, based on 125 reviews, with an average rating of 4.95/10. The site's consensus states: \"A tiresome rom-com.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lot_like_love | title=A Lot like Love | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | access-date=June 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\nManohla Dargis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the film \"isn't half bad and every so often is pretty good, filled with real sentiment, worked-through performances and a story textured enough to sometimes feel a lot like life. If nothing else, ''A Lot Like Love'' is a pleasant reminder of a Hollywood time, seemingly long gone, when boy met girl in a midlevel romantic comedy without arty aspirations . . . or low-brow yucks.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/2005/04/22/movies/22love.html |title=Chapter 1: Passion on a Plane.

To call ''A Lot like Love'' dead in the water is an insult to water.\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050422/REVIEWS/50413001/1023 |title=A Lot Like Love Movie Review & Film Summary |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |first=Roger |last=Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert |date=April 22, 2005 |access-date=January 20, 2014}}</ref> Ebert awarded the film one out four stars, and ultimately included it in his list of \"Most Hated Films\".\n\nRuthe Stein of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' said, \"An unfortunate casting decision . . . comes close to sabotaging a witty script . . . As the sometimes couple, Ashton Kutcher and Amanda Peet are together in almost every scene, making it difficult to conceal the huge gap in their acting skills. Bland and with a small television face (words once used to describe [[David Caruso]], but equally applicable here), Kutcher is incapable of doing the heavy lifting required to be a romantic lead . . . Peet, who has the looks and magnetism of a [[Kennedy family|Kennedy]] offspring, makes Kutcher fade into the background, and you're left fantasizing what the movie might have been if [[Peter Sarsgaard]] had co-starred . . . Still, the movie is rich in the kind of details often left out because of a lack of budget or imagination.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/04/22/DDG87CC8GE1.DTL |title=Kutcher no match for Peet in romantic comedy |first=Ruthe |last=Stein |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=April 22, 2005 |access-date=January 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Christopher Orr (film critic)|Christopher Orr]] of ''[[The New York Sun]]'' said, \"What do you call a shameless imitation of a shameless imitation? A rip-off squared? An homage once removed? Whatever label you choose, it can be comfortably affixed to ''A Lot Like Love'', an Ashton Kutcher-Amanda Peet vehicle that is a lot like ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'', which was itself a lot like ''[[Annie Hall]]''. Sadly, the resemblance does not extend to quality. Indeed, those with a scientific turn of mind may take the devolution from ''Annie'' to ''Harry'' to ''A Lot Like Love'' as yet another demonstration of the [[Second law of thermodynamics|Second Law of Thermodynamics]], which says that in a closed system (an apt description of Hollywood if ever there was one) there is a tendency toward [[entropy]] - in this case, from acknowledged classic to memorable cable-television staple to dim, flabby dud . . . If one thing saves ''A Lot Like Love'' from disaster - and I'm not sure it does - it's an easy chemistry between the leads, though one that owes little to Mr. Kutcher's performance . . . Fortunately, Ms. Peet carries off the role of Emily with enough spark that even Mr. Kutcher gradually lights up . . . Since running away with ''[[The Whole Nine Yards (film)|The Whole Nine Yards]]'' five years ago, Ms. Peet has had altogether too little opportunity to showcase her sexy comic appeal. ''A Lot Like Love'' might have provided that opportunity, had it only featured something a little like a script.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/when-oliver-met-emily/12664/ |title=When Oliver Met Emily |work=[[The New York Sun]] |first=Christopher |last=Orr |author-link=Christopher Orr (film critic) |date=April 22, 2005 |access-date=January 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' rated the film two out of four stars, calling it \"a lot like a lot of other romantic comedies that make two lovers of friends (''When Harry Met Sally'', ''[[Serendipity (film)|Serendipity]]'') and a lot not like the two witty and wise [[Richard Linklater]] movies - ''[[Before Sunrise]]'' and ''[[Before Sunset]]'' - that span the relationship between [[Ethan Hawke]] and [[Julie Delpy]] for nearly a decade and leave you wanting more . . .
