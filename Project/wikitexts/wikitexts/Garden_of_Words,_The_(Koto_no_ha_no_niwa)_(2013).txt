It stars [[Miyu Irino]] and [[Kana Hanazawa]], and features music by Daisuke Kashiwa instead of [[Tenmon (composer)|Tenmon]], who had composed the music for many of Shinkai's previous films. The theme song, \"Rain\", was originally written and performed by [[Senri Oe]] in 1988, but was remade for the film and was sung by [[Motohiro Hata]]. The film was made into a manga, with illustrations by Midori Motohashi, and later novelized by Shinkai, both in the same year as the film.\n\nThe film focuses on Takao Akizuki, an aspiring 15-year-old shoemaker, and Yukari Yukino, a mysterious 27-year-old woman he keeps meeting at [[Shinjuku Gyoen|Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden]] on rainy mornings. While Takao is skipping his morning class to design shoes, Yukari is avoiding work due to personal problems in her professional life. Yukari tells Takao nothing about herself, including her name, while Takao opens up to her, sharing his passion for shoes by offering to make a pair for her. When Takao learns Yukari's identity, emotions come to a head as both learn that they have been teaching each other \"how to walk\". Shinkai wrote the story as a tale of \"lonely sadness\", based on the meaning of the traditional Japanese word for \"love\", and uses shoes as a metaphor for life. The story's motifs include rain, ''[[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b]]'' poetry, and the [[Japanese garden]]. The age difference between the two main characters and their character traits demonstrate how awkwardly and disjointedly people mature, where even adults sometimes feel no more mature than teenagers, according to Shinkai.\n\n''The Garden of Words'' premiered at the Gold Coast Film Festival in Australia on April 28, 2013 and had its general release on May 31, 2013 in Japan. For the Japanese premiere, the film was screened with an animated short called {{Nihongo|''[[Dareka no Manazashi]]''|\u3060\u308c\u304b\u306e\u307e\u306a\u3056\u3057||lit. ''Someone's Gaze''}}, also directed by Shinkai. ''The Garden of Words'' had an unusual release schedule since it was released digitally on iTunes the same day as the Japanese theatrical premier, and its DVD and Blu-ray were released while the film was still in theaters, on June 21. The film has been licensed by [[Sentai Filmworks]] in North America, [[Anime Limited]] in the UK, and [[Madman Entertainment]] in Australia. The film performed well in theaters for an extended period of time and was hosted at many local and international film events. It ranked highly on iTunes Store during 2013 and was selected as the Year's Best Animation in iTunes' Best of 2013. It won the 2013 [[Animation Kobe|Kobe Theatrical Film Award]] and awards at the [[Fantasia International Film Festival]] and the Stuttgart Festival of Animated Film. Online reviews were generally favorable with universal praise of the art, though opinions were mixed regarding the story's length, plot and emotional climax.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\n''The Garden of Words'' opens at the start of the [[East Asian rainy season|rainy season]] in Tokyo with {{Nihongo|Takao Akizuki|\u79cb\u6708 \u5b5d\u96c4|Akizuki Takao}}, a 15-year-old student and aspiring [[Shoemaking|shoemaker]], opting to skip his first class and sketch shoe designs in the garden at [[Shinjuku Gyoen]]. There, he encounters {{Nihongo|Yukari Yukino|\u96ea\u91ce \u767e\u9999\u91cc|Yukino Yukari}}, a 27-year-old woman who is skipping work. Yukari bids him farewell with a [[tanka]] (a form of Japanese poetry), leaving Takao puzzled as to its origin and meaning. The two continue to encounter each other and socialize in the park on rainy mornings, but never formally introduce themselves. Takao decides to make a pair of shoes in her size. With the end of the rainy season, he stops visiting the park and focuses on his work.\n{{Quote box|quote = {{lang|ja|\u9cf4\u795e\u306e \u5c11\u3057\u97ff\u307f\u3066<br/>\u3055\u3057\u66c7\u308a<br/>\u96e8\u3082\u964d\u3089\u306c\u304b<br/>\u541b\u3092\u7559\u3081\u3080}}<br/>\n[A faint clap of thunder<br/>Clouded skies<br/>Perhaps rain comes<br/>If so, will you stay here with me?]\n|source = Yukari in ''The Garden of Words''{{sfn|Garden of Words (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=4:20}}<br/>from Man'y\u014dsh\u016b, Book 11, verse 2,513{{sfn|Man'y\u014dsh\u016b||loc=[http://jti.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/manyoshu/Man11Yo.html#2513 Book 11, verse 2513]}}\n|align = left\n|width = 250px\n|salign = right\n}}\nFollowing summer break, Takao returns to school and spots Yukari, discovering that she is a literature teacher and had been the target of gossip and bullying. To avoid further confrontation, Yukari opted to avoid work and retreat to the park, hoping she would learn to overcome her fears. However, she quits her job and leaves the school. That afternoon, Takao meets Yukari at the park and greets her by reciting the 2,514th poem from the [[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b]] Japanese poetry collection, the correct response to her tanka, which he found in a classic Japanese literature textbook. After getting soaked by a sudden thunderstorm, both head to Yukari's apartment and spend the afternoon together. When Takao confesses his love, Yukari is moved, but reminds him that she is a teacher and that she is moving back to her hometown on [[Shikoku]]. After Takao excuses himself, Yukari realizes her mistake and runs after him. Still upset, Takao angrily takes back what he had said and criticizes her for being so secretive and never opening up to him. Yukari embraces him and the two cry while she explains that their time together in the park had saved her.\n{{Quote box\n|quote = {{lang|ja|\u9cf4\u795e\u306e \u5c11\u3057\u97ff\u307f\u3066<br/>\u964d\u3089\u305a\u3068\u3082<br/>\u543e\u306f\u7559\u307e\u3089\u3080<br/>\u59b9\u3057\u7559\u3081\u3070}}<br/>\n[A faint clap of thunder<br/>Even if rain comes not<br/>I will stay here<br/>Together with you]\n|source = Takao in ''The Garden of Words''{{sfn|Garden of Words (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=30:20}}<br/>from Man'y\u014dsh\u016b, Book 11, verse 2,514{{sfn|Man'y\u014dsh\u016b||loc=[http://jti.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/manyoshu/Man11Yo.html#2514 Book 11, verse 2514]}}\n|align = right\n|width = 250px\n|salign = right\n}}\nThe credits show Takao barely passing his final exams, but still working towards his goals, while Yukari moves back to Shikoku and resumes her teaching career. In a post-credits scene, Takao revisits the park that winter, reads a letter from Yukari, places her finished shoes on the bench, then vows that he will find her after he has made progress with his career.\n\nBoth the manga and serial novels share differences from the anime-film. In the manga illustrated by Midori Motohashi, scenes were either added or slightly modified from the anime version. For example, after the conclusion of the rainy season, Takao was unable to visit the park during the only rainy morning that summer because he had scheduled to visit the footwear college he wanted to attend, disappointing Yukari who had hoped to see him.{{sfn|Shinkai|2013|pp=104\u2013106}} At the conclusion of the story, Yukari is seen wearing the shoes Takao had made for her.{{sfn|Shinkai|2013|pp=188\u2013189}} In the novel, Takao prepared to study abroad in Italy for his cobbling, and had a party with his family. Before he was in Italy, he exchanged letters with Yukari every month or so, and ended up leaving his email address in one of them. Now with each others' email addresses, every message they sent avoided discussing personal issues such as if they were [[Dating|seeing anyone]]. In May 2018, he had some days off and decided to return to Tokyo, in which he reunited with Yukari at the garden and delivered his promised shoes.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Takao Akizuki|\u79cb\u6708 \u5b5d\u96c4|Akizuki Takao}}\n:Takao Akizuki is a mature, hard-working 15-year-old first year high school student who hopes to become a shoemaker.

He was responsible for the storyboards, animation composite, key animation, and editing.{{r|BD_liner|JakartaPost_02Jun2013}} According to Shinkai, his numerous roles in the production of his works is due to the small size of the company, and in this film, it allowed him to tailor many elements of the film to more accurately portray his ideas.{{r|Japanator_20Sept2013}}\n\nThe animated film was produced by Shinkai Creative, CoMix Wave Films, and the producer was Noritaka Kawaguchi.{{r|BD_liner}} Kenichi Tsuchiya was the animation director and was responsible for character design, while Hiroshi Takiguchi was the art director.{{r|BD_liner|ANN_news_20Feb2013|Japanator_21Feb2013}} Planning for the film began in the spring of 2012 and was announced on December 24 of that year. The Japanese release was initially slated for the first half of 2013.{{r|ANN_news_23Dec2012}} Production took only six months, starting with location scouting by Shinkai around [[Shinjuku]]. Production officially started after he had created storyboards based on the photos he took.{{r|ANN_news_08Jul2013}}\n\nShinkai was approached in early 2013 about adapting the material into a manga,{{r|ANN_news_30Apr2013c}} which was then done by Midori Motohashi.{{r|Crunchyroll_16Feb2014}} In April, Shinkai stated that he was not contributing to the adaptation, leaving the work entirely to the manga artist. However, he did express interest in seeing the finished product.{{r|ANN_news_30Apr2013c}}\n\n===Inspirations, motifs, and metaphors===\nAccording to Shinkai's announcement of the film early during its production, ''The Garden of Words'' was his first attempt at making a love story using the [[Love#Japanese|traditional Japanese meaning of \"love\"]]. During the era of the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b, the native Japanese words today known as {{Nihongo||\u5927\u548c\u8a00\u8449|[[yamato kotoba]]|lit. \"Japanese words\"}} were starting to be written using [[kanji]], and the word for \"love\", ''koi'' (today written \u604b) was written as \u5b64\u60b2, or \"lonely sadness\".{{r|Makoto_Shinkai_site|Twitch_17Jun2013}} As noted by Shinkai, a more modern concept of \"romance\", represented by {{Nihongo|''ren'ai''|\u604b\u611b}}, came about by Western influence.{{r|Makoto_Shinkai_site}}{{sfn|Ryang|2006|pp=13\u201314}} ''The Garden of Words'' emphasizes the original meaning of ''koi''\u2014a \"longing for someone in solitude\"\u2014but in a modern setting.{{r|ANN_news_23Dec2012|Twitch_17Jun2013|ANN_news_04Apr2013}} Loneliness is the central element of the film, according to Shinkai. In an interview, he said he created the film with the hope of cheering up people who feel lonely or incomplete in their social relations. However, he made a point that \"this movie doesn't treat loneliness as something that must be fixed.\"{{sfn|Director and Cast Interview (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=27:51}}\n\n[[File:The Garden of Words - photo to art comparison.jpg|thumb|left|Photographs (bottom) were used as a base, with the art (top) drawn over them.]]\nAlthough the story's central theme is loneliness, it uses shoes and rain as motifs, along with Man'y\u014dsh\u016b poetry and the Japanese garden in which it is set.{{sfn|The Works of Makoto Shinkai (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=7:28}} Although rain is typically seen as sad and gloomy, in ''The Garden of Words'' it makes the world more vivid and protects the two main characters from the reality of their lives and the limitations imposed by society.{{r|AnimePro_25Jun2014}} Shinkai also noted a parallel between love and rain\u2014that neither can be controlled or stopped.{{r|JakartaPost_02Jun2013|BeneathTheTangles_Review}}\n\nAccording to Shinkai, shoes were a metaphor for life as Yukari learned to walk again,{{r|ANN_news_08Jul2013}} while Takao's shoe-making typified their relationship.{{r|Japanator_20Sept2013}} Similarly, Yukari's choice of food and beverages\u2014initially beer and chocolate, due to a stress-induced [[Dysgeusia|taste disorder]]\u2014was a metaphor for her emotional health.{{r|ANN_news_08Jul2013}}\n\nIn many of Shinkai's films, sad endings resulting from misunderstandings and unrequited feelings are common. According to Shinkai, his stories are intended to encourage teenagers as they learn to cope with these commonplace experiences.{{r|ANN_news_08Jul2013}} In an interview, he admitted that he had been accustomed to being turned down by women, and felt that his stories were encouraging because his characters continue to try, despite being unsuccessful at love.{{r|Asahi_Shimbun_19Oct2013}} ''The Garden of Words'' also illustrated how people do not mature as linearly or elegantly as we often assume. Shinkai himself could relate with Yukari in not feeling as smart or mature at age 27, stating, \"We're all still just children at age 27,\"{{sfn|Director and Cast Interview (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=14:30}} a point that voice actress [[Kana Hanazawa]] also agreed with.{{sfn|Director and Cast Interview (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=23:00}}\n\nThe original idea for ''The Garden of Words'' came from Shinkai's desire to capture the beauty of the daily scenery in modern [[Tokyo]] and showcase it in a film. Having lived for ten years in Shinjuku,{{r|ANN_news_30Apr2013c}}{{sfn|Director and Cast Interview (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=45:36}} he selected it as the location of the film and set about taking thousands of photos, upon which he created his storyboards.{{r|ANN_news_08Jul2013}} Wanting to share the peace and harmony of his favorite locations in Japan with the hope that it would encourage people to visit,{{r|Japanator_20Sept2013}} Shinkai modeled the garden in the film to match [[Shinjuku Gyoen|Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden]] in Tokyo.{{r|NW_Asian_Weekly}} Following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake in March 2011]], he was worried that it could be destroyed and wanted to preserve it in an animated film.{{r|JakartaPost_02Jun2013}}\n\n===Animation===\n[[File:The Garden of Words - screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|During production, a novel coloring method was used to mimic the refraction of light on the skin of the characters.]]\nLike other Japanese anime, ''The Garden of Words'' was created using a combination of [[Traditional animation|hand-drawn animation]], [[rotoscoping]] and [[computer animation]] (CGI), with the latter facilitating the realistic appearance of the film's rain sequences.{{r|DVDtalk_09Jul2013}} Shinkai made half of the film's backgrounds by using his photographs as a base and then drawing over the top with [[Adobe Photoshop]], while the other half were fictional settings created with traditional animation and computer graphics.{{r|ANN_news_08Jul2013}} As with his other films, the backgrounds are vivid and meticulously drawn scenery while the characters are drawn with less detail, though they are still convincing and realistic.{{r|JakartaPost_02Jun2013}}\n\nFor the rainy scenes at the park, the color palette was toned down, and pale green [[shading]] was used to match the gloomy, rainy weather,{{r|JakartaPost_02Jun2013}} thereby increasing the detail and defining the characters. Matching the [[Tints and shades|tones]] to the background and lighting helped highlight the characters' faces.{{r|AnimeManga_29May2014}} According to Shinkai, a novel coloring method was chosen from other coloring methods following careful testing. The method involved integrating the coloring for each character with the background, a \"new innovation of sorts\" that mimics the refraction of light on the skin as seen in nature. This was accomplished by coloring the outline of the character, including the lines drawn for the separation of lit and shadowed surfaces, and then incorporating the background color onto the surface. Shinkai felt that this coloring method made the anime stand out from others.{{sfn|Director and Cast Interview (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=46:34}}\n\n===Character design and casting===\nShinkai originally envisioned Takao as a boy who wants to help people,{{r|ANN_news_08Jul2013}} but also felt that he should have a passion for making something, since creative work can be rewarding and fulfilling. On a list he made of potential crafts, he picked out the word \"shoes\". After testing it out with his initial plans for the story, he found that it worked out, and in hindsight, he realized that shoemakers also assist people with walking.{{sfn|Director and Cast Interview (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=2:00}}\n\nWhen first presenting the original story to the rest of his team, the team learned that Yukari had unintentionally come across as selfish.{{r|ANN_news_30Apr2013c}} To remedy this, he gave her character nervous traits and personality flaws, such as letting her emotions spill over during mildly upsetting events.{{sfn|Director and Cast Interview (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=6:45}} Shinkai later realized that some of these personality quirks and temporary professional challenges seen in Yukari were present in a former girlfriend, for whom he had written his short film ''[[She and Her Cat]]''.{{r|ANN_news_08Jul2013}} In addition to making Yukari's character more convincing, these character flaws also made it more difficult to plan since she had to be both flawed and attractive to a young boy.{{sfn|Director and Cast Interview (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=14:30}}{{sfn|Director and Cast Interview (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=6:45}} One aspect of her character that Shinkai focused on was her appearance. He felt that she had to be dressed in nice clothes, and particularly nice shoes. In order to balance realism with fashion, he researched shoemaking, worked with a clothing coordinator and stylist, and held weekly fashion meetings with his staff.{{sfn|Director and Cast Interview (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=6:45}}\n\nOne of the \"complicated realistic elements\" of Yukari's character was her sense of purity that only her voice could convey. Though it took days of listening to the audition tapes, Shinkai finally chose Kana Hanazawa, who had a very low natural voice, despite typically playing the roles of high-pitched younger girls. One of the things that impressed Shinkai about Hanazawa's voice was her ability to cover such a broad range of expression.{{sfn|Director and Cast Interview (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=14:30}}\n\nIt was the final scene of the film that made Shinkai glad he had cast Hanazawa. He knew that when Yukari cried, it had to be something impressive in order to emphasize an intense release of emotion. According to Shinkai, music alone could not produce the needed effect, and Hanazawa performed perfectly and without instruction. In an interview, he said, \"I believe that Ms. Hanazawa's acting on that crying scene alone completes the film.\"{{sfn|Director and Cast Interview (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=25:53}} This final scene, which was recorded perfectly on the first take,{{sfn|Director and Cast Interview (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=27:00}} played a pivotal role in the casting decision for Takao's character. Though many [[Voice acting in Japan|Japanese voice actors]] could portray a na\u00efve 15-year-old boy, Shinkai immediately recognized that only Miyu Irino could produce the intense emotion needed for the closing scene.{{sfn|Director and Cast Interview (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=12:35}} Irino had also played Shun and Shin in Shinkai's ''[[Children Who Chase Lost Voices]]''.{{sfn|Director and Cast Interview (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=11:47}}\n\nIn regards to the English dub, Shinkai did not feel that he could judge the quality of the voice acting since he could not speak English natively. He felt that it was good due to the feedback he had received and because he could feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.{{r|Japanator_20Sept2013}}\n\n===Length===\n''The Garden of Words'' is short, lasting approximately 46&nbsp;minutes in length,{{r|ANN_news_08Jul2013|ANN_news_30Apr2013c}} a trend also seen among Shinkai's earlier works.{{r|ANN_news_08Jul2013}} Although he had stated in an interview with [[Anime News Network]] that he does like making shorter films, Shinkai noted that he did not originally plan for the film to be played in theaters. Instead, he intended for people to casually view the film on tablets, computers, and in home theaters.{{r|ANN_news_30Apr2013c}} A target length was never specified from the outset, instead the relationship between Takao and Yukari was emphasized,{{r|ANN_news_08Jul2013}} although it was known from early in the production that the film would be short.{{r|Japanator_20Sept2013}}\n\nShinkai acknowledged that it is difficult to sell 46-minute films in theaters;{{r|ANN_news_08Jul2013}} however, many individuals in the industry had requested to show the film in theaters and conventions.{{r|ANN_news_30Apr2013c}} During an interview at [[Anime Expo]] 2013, a representative from [[Toho]], the film's distribution company, emphasized that the quality of the story and the reputation of its director played a key role in the decision to bring it to theaters.{{r|ANN_news_08Jul2013}}\n\n===Music===\nIn Shinkai's previous films, the music was produced by [[Tenmon (composer)|Tenmon]];{{r|Geekenstein_Review}} however, ''The Garden of Words'' features music by Daisuke Kashiwa.{{r|BD_liner|ANN_news_20Feb2013|Japanator_21Feb2013}} Kashiwa had been a fan of Shinkai's ''[[5 Centimeters Per Second]]'' and had sent him several of his albums. Shinkai listened to these albums while writing the screenplay and then elected to base the film's music off of the songs from Kashiwa's album ''88''. In an interview, Shinkai said that the music was primarily responsible for making the movie seem \"unlike other anime\".{{sfn|Director and Cast Interview (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=32:10}}\n\nThe theme song, \"Rain\", was written and composed by Senri Oe,{{r|ANN_news_20Feb2013|Japanator_21Feb2013}} and was originally a popular Japanese song in 1988.{{r|DVDtalk_09Jul2013}}{{sfn|The Works of Makoto Shinkai (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=8:56}}{{r|THEM_Review}} Shinkai enjoyed listening to Oe's song regularly while attending university, and since one of the film's themes was rain, it was the first song that came to mind while he worked on the production. He particularly liked the song because its lyrics reflected daily life, much like the film.{{sfn|Director and Cast Interview (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=32:10}} The song was remade for the film in 2013, and sung by [[Motohiro Hata]].{{r|DVDtalk_09Jul2013}}{{sfn|Director and Cast Interview (Blu-ray)|2013|loc=32:10}} Shinkai met Hata on several occasions and noted a similarity between Hata's passion as an artisan and that of the character Takao.

To call Garden of Words a simple romance story is to undermine the entire theme, cast away the significance of the message, and belittle the pain of those it is meant to depict.\n|source = Kaze, Beneath The Tangles{{r|BeneathTheTangles_Review}}\n|align = right\n|width = 250px\n|salign = right\n}}\nTwo common themes among Shinkai's films, including ''The Garden of Words'', are subtle romances and lingering emotions.{{r|Digital_Journal}} However, this film's focus on \"lonely sadness\" (''koi'') was interpreted in a couple of ways. According to Cynthia Webb of ''[[The Jakarta Post]]'', the loneliness is seen at the end of the film, when Takao learns to cope with Yukari's move to Shikoku.{{r|JakartaPost_02Jun2013}} Luke Carroll at Anime News Network felt the end of the rainy season and the resulting separation created the sense of ''koi''.{{r|ANN_news_30Apr2013b}}\n\nKaze of Beneath The Tangles, however, disagreed with these interpretations of ''koi'' and the notion that the story was a \"bittersweet romance\" or \"another love story\", and instead felt that the theme was unrecognized. Focusing instead on the human need for companionship and understanding, Kaze noted that both Takao and Yukari lacked meaningful connections with their peers and friends,{{r|BeneathTheTangles_Review}} a view shared by reviewer Bradly Halestorm at ''Hardcore Gamer''.{{r|Hardcore_Gamer_Review}} Together through their conversations\u2014in their \"garden of words\"\u2014they found companionship: Takao finding someone he can share his passion with, and Yukari finding someone who treats her as a person. However, because of the age difference, this discovery varied between the characters. For Yukari, an older and more experienced individual, her hopeless feelings of lonely sadness disappeared when she learned she could connect with Takao, a revelation that she saw as her salvation. For Takao, a boy with an unsupportive family and friends who seemed more like acquaintances, he did not realize his lack of companionship until he discovered it with Yukari, a new feeling he mistook for romantic love but only realized its true nature after she had moved away. According to Kaze, \"romantic love could potentially bloom from such feelings, but that is not what the story is about\". Instead, the love they shared was more basic, making the age difference immaterial. At the end of film, both characters maintained their friendship through letters, but otherwise began growing as people by moving on with their lives and presumably finding new relationships with other people. The hope was that one day they could reunite and renew their companionship \"without needing to cling to each other\". However, neither could \"learn to walk again\" if they continued to isolate themselves from the rest of the world and take shelter with each other in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen.{{r|BeneathTheTangles_Review}}\n\nAnother one of the themes discussed by the film's reviewers was rain or water. According to Cynthia Webb, the rain represented \"unfulfilled longing\",{{r|JakartaPost_02Jun2013}} while Bradly Halestorm saw water as a third main character to the story, acting to both bring Takao and Yukari together and to symbolize the renewal of life.{{r|Hardcore_Gamer_Review}} Kaze felt that the rain symbolized their lonely states, though also acknowledging Shinkai's statement that the rain symbolized uncontrollable love. Following the reasoning that rain symbolized their lonely states, Kaze noted that the tanka had not only romantic intentions, but was also a \"simple plea\" by Yukari for someone to stay with her, even when she's no longer lonely, and not just out of pity.{{r|BeneathTheTangles_Review}}\n\n==Promotion and release==\n===Premiere===\nThe anime film was announced in Japan on December&nbsp;24,&nbsp;2012, with the release scheduled for the first half of 2013{{r|Japanator_24Dec2012|Twitch_23Dec2012}} and news updates available on its Facebook page.{{r|activeAnime_23Dec2012}} On February&nbsp;20,&nbsp;2013, the film's production company, [[CoMix Wave Films]], released a trailer with subtitles in multiple languages on YouTube{{r|ANN_news_20Feb2013|activeAnime_20Feb2013|Twitch_21Feb2013}} and announced that it would be released in Japan on May&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2013.{{r|activeAnime_20Feb2013}}\n\nIn early April, it was announced that the world premiere of the film would be held at [[Gold Coast Film Festival]] (GCFF) in [[Broadbeach, Queensland|Broadbeach]], Queensland, Australia.{{r|ANN_news_04Apr2013|Japanator_02Apr2013}} Scheduled for the end of the festival{{r|ANN_news_30Apr2013b}} at 4:00&nbsp;PM on April&nbsp;28,&nbsp;2013, the film was part of the 'Cool Japan' Gold Coast lineup and included a guest appearance and discussion with Shinkai.{{r|ANN_news_04Apr2013|Japanator_02Apr2013}} The film's premiere was hosted in Australia as a way of showing appreciation to Australians for their support.{{r|ANN_news_04Apr2013}} According to the GCFF's director, the film sold out in advance and was relocated to a larger theater.{{r|ANN_news_30Apr2013a}} Despite feeling nervous about the world premiere,{{r|JakartaPost_02Jun2013}} Shinkai provided a discussion of the film{{r|ANN_news_30Apr2013b|ANN_news_30Apr2013a|GCFF}} and asked everyone to not share the plot and story until after the Japanese release the following month.{{r|ANN_news_30Apr2013a}} Shinkai was scheduled for an hour-long movie poster signing,{{r|ANN_news_30Apr2013a|GCFF}} but ended up staying two and a half hours to accommodate the high turnout.{{r|ANN_news_30Apr2013a}}\n\nFollowing the world premiere, but ahead of the Japanese premiere on May 31, the first five minutes of the film were previewed on [[TV Tokyo]]{{r|Japanator_12May2013|Twitch_14May2013}} and [[Nippon TV|NTV]] on May&nbsp;12.{{r|Digital_Journal}} On May&nbsp;22, it was announced on Shinkai's official Twitter account that the film would play in Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan at the same time and that the film would be available on iTunes on the day of the release.
