The [[Golden Globe Award]]s honored it for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Drama]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor]], and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]. The [[American Film Institute]] placed it second among its [[AFI's 10 Top 10|top ten mystery films]] in 2008.\n\nA sequel, ''[[The Two Jakes]]'', was released in 1990, again starring Nicholson, who also directed, with Robert Towne returning to write the screenplay. The film failed to match the acclaim of its predecessor.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1937, a woman identifying herself as Evelyn Mulwray hires private investigator Jake Gittes to trail her husband Hollis, whom she suspects of infidelity. Hollis Mulwray is chief engineer at the [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power]], and Gittes hears him publicly refuse to build a new dam on safety grounds. Later, Gittes photographs Mulwray in the company of a young woman, and the pictures make their way into the next day's paper.\n\nBack at his office, Gittes is confronted by the real Evelyn Mulwray, who threatens to sue him. Gittes concludes that the fake Evelyn was using him to discredit Mulwray. He goes to a reservoir to search for clues but instead finds his old police associate, Lieutenant Lou Escobar. Mulwray's body had been found in the reservoir, having apparently drowned.\n\nNow working for Evelyn, Gittes investigates Mulwray's death as a homicide. He discovers that although there is supposedly a drought, huge quantities of water are being released from the reservoir every night. Gittes is warned off by Water Department Security Chief Claude Mulvihill and a henchman who slashes Gittes's left nostril. At his office, Gittes receives a call from Ida Sessions, who identifies herself as the fake Mrs. Mulwray. She refuses to disclose the name of the man who hired her, but tells Gittes to check that day's obituaries.\n\nGittes learns that Mulwray was once the business partner of Evelyn's wealthy father, Noah Cross. Over lunch at Cross's club, Cross offers to double Gittes's fee if he'll search for Mulwray's missing mistress. At the hall of records, Gittes discovers that much of the Northwest Valley has recently changed ownership. He visits an orange grove in the valley but is attacked by angry landowners who believe him to be an agent of the Water Department, which they claim is sabotaging the water supply to force them out.\n\nGittes deduces that the Water Department is drying up the land so it can be bought cheaply, and that Mulwray was murdered when he uncovered the plan. He also discovers that some of the property in the valley was seemingly purchased by a recently deceased retirement home resident. Gittes and Evelyn bluff their way into the retirement home and confirm that other real-estate deals were surreptitiously transacted in the names of unknowing residents. Their visit is interrupted by the suspicious director, who has called Mulvihill.\n\nAfter escaping Mulvihill and his thugs, Gittes and Evelyn hide at Evelyn's house and sleep together. During the night, Evelyn receives a phone call and must leave suddenly; she warns Gittes that her father is dangerous. Gittes follows Evelyn's car to a house where he sees Evelyn comforting Mulwray's mistress. He accuses Evelyn of holding the woman hostage, but she claims the woman is her sister, Katherine.\n\nThe next day, an anonymous call draws Gittes to Ida Sessions' apartment, where he finds her body. Lieutenant Escobar, who is waiting there, says the coroner found saltwater in Mulwray's lungs, indicating that he did not drown in the freshwater reservoir. Escobar suspects Evelyn murdered him and tells Gittes to produce her quickly. At the Mulwray mansion, Gittes finds Evelyn gone and the servants packing up the house. He discovers that the garden pond is saltwater and spots a pair of eyeglasses in it. He confronts Evelyn about Katherine, whom Evelyn now claims is her daughter. Gittes slaps Evelyn repeatedly until she breaks down and reveals Katherine is both her sister and her daughter; her father raped her when she was 15 years old. She says that the eyeglasses are not Mulwray's, as he did not wear bifocals.\n\nGittes arranges for the women to flee to [[Mexico]] and instructs Evelyn to meet him at her butler's home in [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]]. He summons Cross to the Mulwray home to settle their deal. Cross admits his intention to incorporate the Northwest Valley into the City of Los Angeles, then irrigate and develop it. Gittes confirms that the bifocals he found are Cross's and accuses Cross of murdering Mulwray. Cross has Mulvihill take the bifocals from Gittes at gunpoint. Gittes is then forced to drive them to Chinatown, where Evelyn is waiting. The police are already there and detain Gittes. When Cross approaches Katherine, identifying himself as her grandfather, Evelyn shoots him in the arm and starts to drive away with Katherine. The police open fire, killing Evelyn. Cross clutches the hysterical Katherine and leads her away, while Escobar orders Gittes to be released. One of Gittes's associates leads him away from the scene, telling him: \"Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.\"\n\n==Cast==\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as J.

Producer Robert Evans wanted Polanski to direct due to his European vision of the United States, which Evans believed would be darker and more cynical. Polanski, a few years removed from the [[Tate murders|murder of his pregnant wife]], [[Sharon Tate]], in Los Angeles, was initially reluctant to return but was persuaded on the strength of the script.<ref name=\"dvd\" />\n\nTowne wanted Cross to die and Evelyn Mulwray to survive. The screenwriter and director argued over it, with Polanski insisting on a tragic end: \"I knew that if ''Chinatown'' was to be special, not just another thriller where the good guys triumph in the final reel, Evelyn had to die\".<ref name=\"TCM\">[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?isPreview=&id=154968%7C28063&name=Chinatown \"Chinatown\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605191012/http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?isPreview=&id=154968%7C28063&name=Chinatown |date=June 5, 2013}}. Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved August 22, 2012.</ref> They parted ways over this dispute and Polanski wrote the final scene a few days before it was shot.<ref name=\"dvd\" />\n\nThe original script was more than 180 pages and included a narration by Gittes; Polanski cut and reordered the story so the audience and Gittes unraveled the mysteries at the same time.\n\n===Characters and casting===\n* J. J. Gittes was named after Nicholson's friend, producer Harry Gittes.\n* Evelyn Mulwray is, according to Towne, intended to initially seem the classic \"black widow\" character typical of lead female characters in [[film noir]], but is eventually revealed to be a tragic victim. [[Jane Fonda]] was strongly considered for the role, but Polanski insisted on Dunaway.<ref name=\"dvd\" />\n* Noah Cross: Towne said that Huston was, after Nicholson, the second-best-cast actor in the film and that he made the Cross character menacing, through his courtly performance.<ref name=\"dvd\" />\n* Polanski appears in a cameo as the gangster who cuts Gittes' nose. The effect was accomplished with a special knife which could have actually cut Nicholson's nose if Polanski had not held it correctly.\n\n===Filming===\n[[William A. Fraker]] accepted the cinematographer position from Polanski when Paramount agreed. He had worked with the studio previously on Polanski's ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]''. Robert Evans, never consulted about the decision, insisted that the offer be rescinded since he felt pairing Polanski and Fraker again would create a team with too much control over the project and complicate the production.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6owDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA11|title=A Hidden History of Film Style: Cinematographers, Directors, and the Collaborative Process|last=Beach|first=Christopher|date=May 2015|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=9780520284357}}</ref>\n\nBetween Fraker and the eventual choice [[John A. Alonzo]], the two compromised on [[Stanley Cortez]], but Polanski grew frustrated with Cortez\u2019s slow process, old fashioned compositional sensibility, and unfamiliarity with the Panavision equipment. Alonzo was chosen for his fleetness and skill with natural light a few weeks into production. Ultimately, only a handful of scenes in the finished film, including the orange grove confrontation, were shot by Cortez.<ref name=\"Wasson, Sam 2020\"/>\n\nIn keeping with a technique Polanski attributes to [[Raymond Chandler]], all of the events of the film are seen subjectively through the main character's eyes; for example, when Gittes is knocked unconscious, the film fades to black and fades in when he awakens. Gittes appears in every scene of the film.<ref name=\"dvd\" /> This subjectivity is the same construction as Francis Coppola's ''The Conversation'' in which the main character, Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) appears in every scene in the film. ''The Conversation'' began shooting eleven months prior to ''Chinatown''.\n\nHis favorite illustration of this was the \"parable of the hair\". Robert Evans had flown in [[Ara Gallant]] from New York to streak Dunaway's coiffure for the movie, and in the course of one of Polanski's more complicated lighting setups, an errant hair escaped.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}} During a scene set inside the Brown Derby restaurant, Polanski tried to shoot past the loose strand in what would otherwise have been a perfect 1930s [[Marcel wave|marcel]]: tight, blonde, and lacquered against her skull \u00e0 la [[Jean Harlow]].{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}\n\nIt took a summit meeting in Evans's Paramount office before Dunaway would return to work. Polanski fanned the incident in the press as a perfect example of American star hysterics, while Dunaway insisted her hair wasn't the point: \"It was not the hair.

The water project it depicts isn't the construction of the [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]], engineered by [[William Mulholland]] before the First World War. ''Chinatown'' is set in 1937, not 1905. The Mulholland-like figure\u2014\"Hollis Mulwray\"\u2014isn't the chief architect of the project, but rather its strongest opponent, who must be discredited and murdered. Mulwray is against the \"Alto Vallejo Dam\" because it's unsafe, not because it's stealing water from somebody else.... But there are echoes of Mulholland's aqueduct project in ''Chinatown''.... Mulholland's project enriched its promoters through insider land deals in the [[San Fernando Valley]], just like the dam project in ''Chinatown''. The disgruntled San Fernando Valley farmers of ''Chinatown'', forced to sell off their land at bargain prices because of an artificial drought, seem like stand-ins for the Owens Valley settlers whose homesteads turned to dust when Los Angeles took the water that irrigated them. The \"Van Der Lip Dam\" disaster, which Hollis Mulwray cites to explain his opposition to the proposed dam, is an obvious reference to the collapse of the [[Saint Francis Dam]] in 1928. Mulholland built this dam after completing the aqueduct and its failure was the greatest man-made disaster in the history of California. These echoes have led many viewers to regard ''Chinatown'', not only as docudrama, but as truth\u2014the real secret history of how Los Angeles got its water. And it has become a ruling metaphor of the non-fictional critiques of Los Angeles development.<ref>Andersen, Thom (writer, director), voiceover narration in ''[[Los Angeles Plays Itself]]'' (2004), released (2014) by [[The Cinema Guild]].</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2018}}\nThe film earned $29 million at the North American box office.<ref name=BOM/>\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Chinatown'' holds an approval rating of 99% based on 76 reviews, with an average rating of 9.40/10.
