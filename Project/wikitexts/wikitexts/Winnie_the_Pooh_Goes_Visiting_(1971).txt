The film is based on chapter two in the book series by [[A. A. Milne]].

A new character ([[Rabbit (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Rabbit]]) is added to the core cast of the first part: Winnie-the-Pooh, the narrator, and the Piglet.<ref name=int/><ref name=comp/>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vladimir Osenev]] as the narrator.<ref name=int2/>\n* [[Yevgeny Leonov]] as [[Winnie-the-Pooh]].<ref name=int2/> \n* [[Iya Savvina]] as [[Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Piglet]].<ref name=int2/> \n* [[Anatoly Shchukin]] as [[Rabbit (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Rabbit]].<ref name=int2/>\n\n==Legacy and awards==\nIn 1976 Khitruk was awarded the [[USSR State Prize]] for the ''Winnie-the-Pooh'' trilogy.<ref name=award/> The animation characters, as designed by Khitruk's team, are featured on the [[:File:1988 CPA 5916.jpg|1988 Soviet]] and [[:File:Stamp of Russia 2012 No 1652 Winnie-the-Pooh.jpg|2012 Russian]] postal stamps; they are permanently painted on a [[:File:RIAN archive 417728 The first of the \"Fairy Streetcar\" project launched in Sokolniki.jpg|public streetcar]] running through the [[Sokolniki Park]], and their sculptures are installed in [[Ramenki District]] in Moscow.<ref name=sculpt/>\n\nWhen Khitruk visited the Disney Studios, [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], the director of ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day]]'', which won the 1968 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]], told him that he liked the Soviet version better than his own.<ref name=award/><ref name=disney/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=award>[http://aakr.ru/people/Fyodor-Khitruk \u0424\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0440 \u0425\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a (Fyodor Khitruk)].
