It was S\u00e1nchez's first solo effort as director, following his co-directing of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' in 1999.\n\nThe plot is an inversion of the standard alien abduction formula, as four men abduct a lone alien, planning to wreak revenge on the invading species. In its early stages, the film was entitled ''Probed'', and was intended as a comic homage to the work of [[Sam Raimi]] and [[Troma Entertainment]].<ref>\"It was a horror-comedy I wrote called Probed about rednecks who abduct an alien. Evil Dead 2 in tone. Or maybe Troma. Ed dug it and thought it was funny. But realized horror-comedy might not be the easiest sell.\" http://actfourscreenplays.com/screenwriting-blog/horror-interview-with-lovely-molly-screenwriter-jamie-nash/</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n''Altered'' is the story of four men who seek revenge on aliens, who abducted them and murdered their friend many years ago. As is explained via dialogue throughout the film, fifteen years before the events shown in the film, a group of five friends living in a remote American town were captured and experimented on by aliens while on a hunting trip. Only four of the friends returned alive.\n\nThe main character (Wyatt) has since distanced himself from his childhood friends and is shown to have decided to live with the past, albeit in apparent constant [[paranoia]]. Two of the remaining three characters, however, have been obsessed by revenge and have persuaded the remaining character that this is the correct course of action to take. The story opens with the tracking and subsequent capture of a lone alien\u2014the consequences of which Wyatt and the three friends soon become deeply involved in.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Paul McCarthy-Boyington]] as Cody\n* [[Brad William Henke]] as Duke\n* [[Michael C.
