Nana tells the story of her young life when she was sent to a [[ghetto]] and then a [[concentration camp]].\n\nThe [[romantic love]] feelings she has for the boy are indeed strong and genuine, but the romantic love he has for her is questionable.\n\nEthan lets his friends judge her from the outside, not for who she is on the inside. And when she turns out to not be like every other girl he breaks up with her.\n\nDaisy is sad so she goes and sees Nana and takes her anger out on her. She then runs away and tries to kill herself by walking in front of a moving train but she does not as her nana is there for her.\n\nAt the end, she tries to see him again but he looks at her for a long time and walks away with his friends. She stands there; heartbroken, sad and crying, realizing that maybe it was not meant to be and she walks away happy.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jeanne Moreau]] as Nana\n*[[Claire Danes]] as Daisy/Young Nana\n*[[Jude Law]] as Ethan\n*[[James Van Der Beek]] as Tony\n*Kris Park as Seth\n*Lauren Fox as Alsion\n*Emily Burkes-Nossiter as Jessica\n*Carrie Szlasa as Jane\n*[[Julia Stiles]] as Young Nana's Friend\n*[[Robert Sean Leonard]] as Angel of Death\n*Frederick Neumann as School Principal\n*Peter F.
