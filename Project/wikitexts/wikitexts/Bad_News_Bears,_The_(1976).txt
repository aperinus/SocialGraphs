It stars [[Walter Matthau]] as an alcoholic ex-baseball pitcher who becomes a coach for a youth [[baseball]] team known as the Bears. Alongside Matthau, the film's cast includes [[Tatum O'Neal]], [[Vic Morrow]],\n[[Joyce Van Patten]], [[Ben Piazza]], [[Jackie Earle Haley]], and [[Alfred Lutter|Alfred W. Lutter]]. Its score, composed by [[Jerry Fielding]], adapts the principal themes of [[Bizet]]'s opera ''[[Carmen]]''.\n\nReleased by [[Paramount Pictures]], ''The Bad News Bears'' received generally positive reviews. It was followed by two sequels, ''[[The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training]]'' in 1977 and ''[[The Bad News Bears Go to Japan]]'' in 1978, a short-lived 1979\u201380 [[CBS]] [[The Bad News Bears (TV series)|television series]], and a 2005 [[Bad News Bears|remake]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1976, Morris Buttermaker, an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] pool cleaner and former minor-league [[baseball]] [[pitcher]], is recruited to coach \"the Bears,\" a youth baseball league [[expansion team]] of misfit players in [[Southern California]], formed as a settlement to a lawsuit brought against the league for excluding such players from other teams. Shunned by the more competitive teams (and competitive parents and coaches), the Bears are the outsiders, and the least talented team in the league. Buttermaker [[wikt:forfeit|forfeit]]s the opening game after the team allows 26 runs without recording an out.\n\nWith the entire team wanting to quit due to the humiliation of their first loss, Buttermaker recruits two unlikely prospects: sharp-tongued Amanda Wurlitzer, a skilled pitcher (trained by Buttermaker when she was younger) and the 11-year-old daughter of one of Buttermaker's ex-girlfriends; and the local cigarette-smoking, loan-sharking, [[Harley-Davidson]]-riding troublemaker, Kelly Leak, who also happens to be the best athlete in the area, but has been excluded from playing in the past by league officials. With Amanda and Kelly on board, the team starts gaining more confidence, and the Bears start winning games. The [[subplot]] reveals the strained relationship between Buttermaker and Amanda as the team improves.\n\nEventually, the Bears make it to the championship game opposite the top-notch Yankees, who are coached by aggressive, competitive Roy Turner.  As the game progresses, tensions rise between the teams and the coaches, as Buttermaker and Turner engage in ruthless behavior toward each other and the players in order to win the game. When Turner strikes his son, the pitcher, for ignoring orders by intentionally throwing at another child's head (an action which occasionally occurs in baseball but which is against the rules, frowned upon, and extremely dangerous) Buttermaker realizes that he, too, has placed too much emphasis on winning, and puts in his benchwarmers to allow everyone to play.  Despite Buttermaker's move, the Bears nearly win the game.  Buttermaker gives the team beer which they spray on each other with a field celebration as if they had won.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- cast and order per opening (only Matthau, O'Neal, Morrow) and closing credits through second screen of \"The Bears\", roles per closing credits --->\nNote that top billed, shown in opening credits, were Matthau, O'Neal and Morrow.\n\n===Adults===\n* [[Walter Matthau]] as Morris Buttermaker, coach of the Bears: A drunken, loud, ex-professional baseball pitcher and part-time pool cleaner, who drives a rundown blue Cadillac convertible\n* [[Vic Morrow]] as Roy Turner, coach of the Yankees who is competitive and aggressive\n* [[Joyce Van Patten]] as Cleveland, league manager who favors Roy and the Yankees\n* [[Ben Piazza]] as Bob Whitewood, city councilman and lawyer who sued the league to allow the Bears (in particular, his son) to play and who convinces (and pays) Buttermaker to coach the team\n\n===Children===\n* [[Tatum O'Neal]] as Amanda Wurlitzer, the 11-year-old star pitcher for the Bears who feels insecure about her [[tomboy]] image. She is recruited by Buttermaker to help the team start winning. She is no-nonsense and a great pitcher who was taught by Buttermaker when she was young. The boys grow to be very protective of her, picking a fight with their rivals during the championship game when Amanda is kicked in the chest. Her mother is Buttermaker's ex-girlfriend and she looks to him as a father figure. Amanda and Tanner butt heads a lot, but respect each other. She also has a secret crush on Kelly.\n* [[Chris Barnes (actor)|Chris Barnes]] as Tanner Boyle, the short-tempered shortstop with a [[Napoleon complex]]; after suffering a horrible loss on their first game, he picks a fight with the entire seventh grade from the boys' middle school (and loses). He tends to curse more than the others, and initially insults and bullies Timmy before realizing he's treating Timmy no better than the kids from their rival team and becomes protective of him, leading to an unlikely friendship between them. He is also close friends with Ahmad.\n* [[Jackie Earle Haley]] as Kelly Leak, the local troublemaker who smokes and rides a mini [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle. Kelly is also the best athlete in the neighborhood. At first, he doesn't want to join when Amanda attempts to recruit him, but he changes his mind when Coach Turner threatens him. He alternates between left- and center-field and has a crush on Amanda. After joining the team, he forms close friendships with Tanner, Ahmad and Ogilvie.\n* Erin Blunt as Ahmad Abdul-Rahim, a black Muslim boy who plays in the outfield, is liked by everyone on the team and adores [[Hank Aaron]]; Ahmad strips off his uniform in shame after committing several errors in the Bears' first game, but is convinced to return to the team by Buttermaker and is used for bunts in games due to his speed. He is shown to be close friends with Tanner.\n* Gary Lee Cavagnaro as Mike Engelberg, an overweight boy who plays [[catcher]]; a great hitter, he frequently teases Tanner about his size. He breaks Buttermaker's windshield with a baseball at the first practice. He has a deep rivalry with Yankee pitcher Joey, causing them to throw insults at each other.\n* [[Alfred Lutter|Alfred W. Lutter]] as Alfred Ogilvie, a bookworm who memorizes baseball statistics. He's mostly a bench-warmer who assists Buttermaker with defensive strategy. A backup outfielder/first baseman, but reluctant to play because he feels he's one of the lesser-skilled players on the team.\n* Quinn Smith as Timmy Lupus, initially described by Tanner as a \"booger-eating spaz,\" plays right-field and is considered to be the worst player on the team \u2014 if not the entire league \u2014 but he surprises everyone in the championship game by making a key play to keep the Bears in the game. He is the most quiet and shy player, but shows the odd ability to properly prepare a martini for Coach Buttermaker while the team was assisting the coach with pool cleaning.\n* David Stambaugh as Toby Whitewood, an unassuming boy who plays first base. He knows about the other players' personalities, is intelligent and well-spoken, and at times speaks on behalf of the team. He is the son of councilman Bob Whitewood, who secretly paid Buttermaker to coach the team.\n* Jaime Escobedo as Jose Aguilar, Miguel's older brother who plays second base; doesn't speak English.\n* George Gonzales as Miguel Aguilar, Jose's younger brother; mostly plays right-field. He does not speak English. He is so short that the [[strike zone]] is practically non-existent.\n* David Pollock as Rudi Stein, a nervous [[relief pitcher]] with glasses who is a terrible hitter; at times he is asked by Coach Buttermaker to purposely get hit by pitches in order to get on base. Also a backup outfielder.\n* [[Brett Marx]] as Jimmy Feldman, a fairly quiet third baseman with curly blond hair.\n* Scott Firestone as Regi Tower, a fairly quiet, red-headed third baseman whose dad vocally attends practices and games. Also plays first base.\n* [[Brandon Cruz]] as Joey Turner, the star pitcher for the Yankees. Coach Roy Turner's son. He has a rivalry with Engelberg and regularly bullies Tanner and Timmy. Allows Engelberg an inside-the-park home run, then quits the team after Roy slaps him in anger for almost [[beanball|beaning]] Engelberg.\n\n==Production==\n''The Bad News Bears'' was filmed in and around [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], primarily in the [[San Fernando Valley]].
