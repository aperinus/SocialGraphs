It was directed by [[Brian Gibson (director)|Brian Gibson]] and written by [[Kate Lanier]]. The film stars [[Angela Bassett]] as Tina Turner and [[Laurence Fishburne]] as her husband [[Ike Turner]].\n\nAdapted from Tina Turner's autobiography ''[[I, Tina]]'' (1986), the film follows her life from a rural upbringing to her rise to stardom, along with her abusive marriage to Ike Turner.\n\n''What's Love Got to Do with It'' premiered in Los Angeles on June 6, 1993, and was theatrically released by [[Touchstone Pictures]] on June 25, 1993. Although Tina Turner and Ike Turner were not happy with the accuracy of the film, it was a critical and commercial success. It grossed $61 million on a $15 million budget. For their performances, Bassett and Fishburne received nominations at the [[66th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. Bassett also won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]].\n\n==Plot==\nRaised in [[Nutbush, Tennessee]], Anna Mae Bullock grows up in an unhappy family with her parents leaving and abandoning her at a young age.\n\nFollowing her grandmother's death, Anna Mae relocates to [[St. Louis]], reuniting with her mother and older sister [[Alline Bullock|Alline]]. Anna Mae pursues a chance to be a professional singer, after seeing charismatic bandleader [[Ike Turner]] perform one night. Later, she wins her spot in Turner's band after singing onstage, and he begins mentoring her. In time, an unexpected romance develops between the two, after she moves into Ike's home. Shortly afterwards, they marry and begin having musical success together as [[Ike & Tina Turner]].\n\nThe marriage quickly turns violent when Ike starts physically dominating Tina, leaving her no chance to escape. In public, Tina rises from a local St. Louis phenomenon into an international [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] star, with Ike growing increasingly jealous of the attention given to her. Ike turns to drugs as his behavior worsens while Tina finds solace in [[Buddhism]] by chanting [[Nam Myoho Renge Kyo]]. Tina grows increasingly confident and in a final fight with Ike, she finally musters the courage to [[self-defense|defend]] herself; eventually she leaves Ike after they arrive at a hotel.\n\nWinning the right to retain her stage name after their divorce, Tina continues working to pay bills. She gets a break after meeting [[Roger Davies (manager)|Roger Davies]], who eventually helps her realize her dreams of [[Rock music|rock]] stardom. Despite Ike's attempts to win her back, Tina prevails and finds solo success, accomplishing her dreams without Ike. The film concludes with real life concert footage of Tina in the 1980s.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as [[Tina Turner]], born Anna Mae Bullock\n** [[Rae'Ven Larrymore Kelly]] as young Anna Mae\n* Cora Lee Day as Grandma Georgiana\n* [[Khandi Alexander]] as Darlene\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as [[Ike Turner]]\n* [[Jenifer Lewis]] as Zelma Bullock, Tina's mother\n* Phyllis Yvonne Stickney as [[Alline Bullock]]\n* [[Penny Johnson Jerald]] as Lorraine Taylor\n* [[Vanessa Bell Calloway]] as Jackie\n* [[Chi McBride]] as Fross\n* Sherman Augustus as Reggie\n* Terrence Riggins as Spider\n* Bo Kane as Dance Show Host\n* [[Terrence Evans]] as Bus Driver\n* Rob LaBelle as [[Phil Spector]]\n* [[James Reyne]] as [[Roger Davies (manager)|Roger Davies]]\n* [[Richard T.

The changes helped persuade Fishburne to do the role, but he says that Bassett's casting as Tina \"was the deciding factor.\"<ref name=\"tribunedigital-orlandosentinel\" /><ref name=\"vulture\" />\n\nFishburne did not have Ike Turner around to help model his performance as much as he would have liked.

Tina stated in her book that after her suicide attempt she joked with a friend that she was so afraid of Ike, he probably threatened her which is why she survived. She was unconscious and didn't know what he actually said. Ike stated in his book that he scolded Tina as his way of motivating her to fight for her life.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* During the time Tina is planning her comeback in the early 1980s, a reenactment of an interview features Tina rehearsing her song \"[[I Might Have Been Queen]].\" The song would be recorded for her 1984 comeback album, ''[[Private Dancer]]''.\n* The incident in the [[Webster Hall|Ritz Theatre]] where Ike fails to scare Tina with his pistol is fabricated. Allegedly, Ike made threats to hire a hitman, so Tina carried a pistol, but he did not threaten her in person with a gun as depicted.{{Sfn|Turner|Loder|p=162}}\n* Before performing \"[[What's Love Got to Do with It (song)|What's Love Got to Do with It]] \" at the Ritz in 1983, the emcee announces that it was her \"first appearance,\" but she first performed there in 1981. Her 1983 performance there occurred before the recording of \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" and led to [[Capitol Records]] signing a contract with her.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* A title card at the end states that Tina's first solo album won four Grammy Awards, implying it was ''Private Dancer''. In reality that album was her fifth solo album.
