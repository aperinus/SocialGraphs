Think carefully before adding material to this section-->\n[[Will McKenzie|Will]], [[Neil Sutherland (The Inbetweeners)|Neil]] and [[Jay Cartwright|Jay]]'s girlfriends, whom they [[The Inbetweeners Movie|met in Malia]], have since broken up with them. [[Simon Cooper (fictional character)|Simon]] is unhappy with his relationship with Lucy, who has become [[stalking|obsessive]] and [[verbal abuse|abusive]]. While Jay is taking a [[gap year]] in [[Australia]], Neil and Simon visit Will at the [[University of Bristol]], Jay contacts them, claiming he is a [[DJ]] at a popular [[nightclub]] in [[Sydney]] and lives in a luxury mansion. The trio decide to go to Australia to visit Jay. Upon arrival, they discover that Jay works as a night club [[toilet attendant]] and lives in his uncle Bryan's front garden. Whilst at the night club, Will is reunited with Katie, his first love from private school, who is [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking]]. At her request, Will agrees to join her at [[Byron Bay]]. When the boys return to Bryan's house, Simon attempts to break up with Lucy over [[Skype]], but Bryan tricks her into thinking Simon is [[Marriage proposal|proposing]] and Lucy agrees to marry him.\n\n[[File:Byron Lighthouse looking south 2004-28-12.JPG|thumb|[[Byron Bay]]]]\nThe four boys travel to a youth hostel in [[Byron Bay]] and meet the backpackers, with member Ben taking a disliking to Will for being a holidaymaker. Simon deduces that Jay is in Australia to win Jane back following their breakup, as it is revealed she is in the country. That night, Will sings a bad [[falsetto]] cover of \"[[The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face]]\" to Katie, who seduces him at the hostel. Before they can have sex, Katie passes out, shortly before a backpacker enters and attacks Will for thinking he is engaging in [[rape]].\n\nThe boys join the backpackers at a [[water park]] named Splash Planet the next day, Jay believing Jane works there. Neil accidentally kills a dolphin by feeding it [[fast food]], and Simon is attacked by some fathers after they mistake him for a [[paedophile]]. Jay is told that Jane has since left Splash Planet and is working in the [[outback]]. Ben challenges Will to a race on a waterslide, but Neil soils himself due to [[irritable bowel syndrome|IBS]] symptoms and his [[faeces]] follows Will down the slide. Will wins the race, but is hit in the face by the faeces, causing him to vomit uncontrollably and the pool to be evacuated.\n\nThe boys leave Splash Planet, and Jay opens up about wishing to reconnect with Jane. Lucky tells Simon that Jane works in [[Birdsville]]. The boys prepare to drive there, but Will, angry and dejected over the Splash Planet incident and towards the boys' treatment of him, stays in Byron Bay in the hopes of starting a relationship with Katie. Will ultimately struggles to fit in with the \"spiritual\" activities of the travellers and discovers that Katie is sleeping with multiple people at once. He angrily rebukes the group and buys a flight ticket to Birdsville, reconciling with the boys.\n\nIn the desert, the car runs out of fuel and the boys are unsuccessful in their attempts to get help. Believing they will soon die, they are rescued by Jane and her colleagues. Jane is touched by Jay's efforts to win her over again, but does not take him back. Back at Bryan's house in [[Sydney]], the boys discover that Jay's father and Will's mother have flown out to meet them. To Will's dismay, his old head of [[sixth form]], [[Mr Gilbert]], is now in a relationship with Will's mother. Over Skype, Lucy breaks up with Simon after revealing that she has been having sex with Pete, one of Simon's friends, which Simon responds to by ecstatically ending the call. The boys drive off to continue travelling in Australia.\n\nIn a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] over the credits, the four travel from Australia to [[Vietnam]], and then spend time in [[Cambodia]]. Upon their return to the [[United Kingdom]] several months later, Neil is in a relationship with an older female traveller from the Byron Bay hostel, while Will's mother announces her engagement to Mr. Gilbert, much to Will's horror.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:The Inbetweeners Cast.jpg|thumb|From left to right: [[Joe Thomas (actor)|Joe Thomas]], [[Simon Bird]], [[James Buckley (actor)|James Buckley]] and [[Blake Harrison]]]]\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Simon Bird]] as [[Will McKenzie]]<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/s121/the-inbetweeners/news/a536848/the-inbetweeners-movie-2-reveals-first-picture-from-australia.html|title=The Inbetweeners Movie 2 reveals first picture from Australia|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=9 December 2013|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|access-date=20 January 2014}}</ref>\n* [[James Buckley (actor)|James Buckley]] as [[Jay Cartwright (fictional character)|Jay Cartwright]]<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n* [[Blake Harrison]] as [[Neil Sutherland (The Inbetweeners)|Neil Sutherland]]<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n* [[Joe Thomas (actor)|Joe Thomas]] as [[Simon Cooper (fictional character)|Simon Cooper]]<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n* [[Emily Berrington]] as Katie Evans\n* [[Belinda Stewart-Wilson]] as Polly McKenzie<ref name=\"cast\"/> \n* [[Tamla Kari]] as Lucy\n* [[Freddie Stroma]] as Ben Thornton-Wild\n* [[Lydia Rose Bewley]] as Jane\n* [[David Schaal (actor)|David Schaal]] as Terry Cartwright\n* [[Alex Macqueen]] as Kevin Sutherland\n* [[Martin Trenaman]] as Alan Cooper\n* [[Robin Weaver]] as Pamela Cooper\n* [[Greg Davies]] as [[Mr Gilbert]]\n* [[Adam Nagaitis]] as Pete\n* Oliver Johnstone as Kristian\n* [[Susan Wokoma]] as Della\n* Steve Brody as Bristol pub landlord<ref>British Comedy Guide https://www.comedy.co.uk/film/the_inbetweeners_movie_2/cast_crew/</ref>\n* Brad Kannegiesser as Jasper\n* [[David Field (actor)|David Field]] as Uncle Bryan (''uncredited'')<ref name=keller/>\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n[[Daisy Ridley]]'s scene was cut from the final version.

to their lack of experience in the position.<ref name=keily/>\n\nMorris had considered filming the Australian scenes in [[South Africa]] due to the comparatively high costs in Australia, which despite a higher budget caused the sequel to have fewer resources than its predecessor.<ref name=keily/> While all locations for the first film had been within 10 minutes of the hotel, locations in the second were separated by a three-hour flight and nine-hour car journey.<ref name=keily/> During filming in the Outback, the Australian crew provided two doctors and 40 litres of IV fluid, although the only
