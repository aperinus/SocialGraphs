It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 4, 2008.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs|Beast with a Billion Backs]]'' DVD commentary, the film, which spoofs ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', was in production when ''Dungeons & Dragons'' creator, [[Gary Gygax]], died. The film contains a [[post-credits scene|post-credits]] tribute to Gygax in the form of a title card and a clip of him from the episode \"[[Anthology of Interest I]]\". Elements of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and [[George Lucas]]' ''[[Star Wars]]'' are also parodied. The title of the film is a pun on the book ''[[Ender's Game]]'',<ref>[http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/11/futuramas-anima.html Futurama Animators Roll 20-Sided Die With Bender's Game]</ref> by [[Orson Scott Card]], though the ''Futurama'' film has \"very little to do with the subject material\" of the book.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080702002538/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=1&id=56890 Bender's Game Just A Pun (Wayback Machine)]</ref> Conversely, the 1985 book also used \"Bender\" as a mocking pun for \"Ender\", but [[Matt Groening]] stated<ref name=\"names\">{{Cite book|title= Sci-Fi Baby Names: 500 Out-of-this-world Baby Names from Anakin to Zardoz|pages=119 |chapter=Intellectual Names}}</ref> this is not the original inspiration for Bender's name.\n\n==Plot==\nDefying Professor Farnsworth, Leela borrows the ''Planet Express Ship'' to enter a demolition derby after insults from rednecks anger her. Bender finds Cubert and Dwight playing ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', but cannot join in since, as a robot, he has no imagination. Bender manages to imagine himself as a medieval knight named \"Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood\" and enters the game. He becomes lost in his fantasy and goes on a rampage, resulting in his commitment to the Hal Institute for Criminally Insane Robots.\n\nThe crew learns that Mom, who controls the world's only [[dark matter]] mine, is restricting the supply to drive up profits. The Professor reveals that while working for Mom, he discovered how to turn dark matter into fuel. The process created two crystals, with Mom keeping one for herself and Farnsworth hiding the other, \"anti-backwards\" crystal. If the crystals are brought together, they will render dark matter useless. Farnsworth, Fry, and Leela fly to Mom's mine with the crystal to neutralize the dark matter.\n\nEncountering Mom and her three sons, Leela fends off Walt, Larry and Igner, while Farnsworth tries to bring his and Mom's crystals together; when Farnsworth is at risk of losing the anti-backwards crystal, he swallows it. The closeness of the crystals triggers a resonance in all dark matter and catapults the characters into Cornwood, the realm Bender imagines himself to be from.\n\n\"Frydo\" (Fry) and \"Leegola\" (Leela, now a centaur) encounter \"Titanius\" (Bender); no one in Cornwood has any memory of their real lives except for Fry and Leela. The three are attacked by \"Waltazar\" (Walt), \"Larius\" (Larry) and \"Ignus\" (Igner), who are trying to recover the anti-backwards crystal. While fighting them off, Frydo drops the crystal, which rolls like a die and magically banishes the sons. Frydo and company meet the wizard \"Greyfarn\" (Farnsworth), who explains that in this world, the anti-backwards crystal is known as the Die of Power. The evil sorceress \"Momon\" (Mom) molded a set of powerful dice, but lost this one and has been trying to locate it so she can tap its immense potential. The only way to stop Momon is to enter her lair at the Geysers of Gygax and throw the Die into the lake of molten plastic from which it was formed.\n\nAs the group sets out, the intersex, pacifist centaur Hermaphrodite (Hermes) bars their passage; the centaurs are opposed to the violence that Frydo and company intend to do. Leela easily pushes past Hermaphrodite and leads the group to the Cave of Hopelessness. As they approach, \"Gynecaladriel\" (Amy), Queen of the Water [[nymphomania|Nymphos]], joins their quest and seduces the guard, enabling them to enter the Cave. Inside the Cave, a horde of \"Morcs\" attacks followed by a gigantic lobster creature (Zoidberg) which Leegola cuts to pieces in a rage, and the wormlike Tunneling Horror which Frydo defeats using the Die. As Frydo becomes obsessed with the Die, Leegola renounces violence and takes refuge among the centaurs. Frydo attempts to murder the other members of the party; when foiled, he flees with the die.\n\nThe remaining travelers journey to Wipe Castle to raise an army against Momon, only to find that Roberto, its insane king, has sent his men on a suicide mission. The heroes defend the kingdom as Waltazar and Larius lay siege to it until Leegola regains her violent nature and rallies the centaurs to help her friends. Frydo makes his way into Momon's lair, aided by Zoidberg's still-living head; Frydo cannot bring himself to destroy the Die, so Zoidberg bites him to force him to drop it. Momon becomes a dragon and goes after the Die, but when it stops rolling, it turns Frydo into a dragon as well. The rest of the party arrives, along with Ignus, who reveals a secret Momon told his brothers: he is Greyfarn's son. Overwhelmed by this revelation, Greyfarn inadvertently allows Momon to seize the Die.\n\nCornwood collapses in on itself, hurling the characters back into the real world. The Professor requests a hug from Igner. As the Professor theorized, Igner swallowed Mom's crystal in defiance, and the hug brings the crystals in the two men's stomachs close enough to render dark matter useless. The crew harnesses dozens of Nibblonians to pull their ship home.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Do not add all the characters credited unless they are substantial to the plot, listed in the \"recurring characters\" articles, etc.-->\n* [[Billy West]] as [[Fry (Futurama)|Philip J.

The cartoon on the Jumbotron is ''[[Quasi at the Quackadero]]''.  Similar to [[Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs|the previous film]], instead of the ship crashing into the Jumbotron as in a regular episode, it gets absorbed through the screen, whereupon the opening sequence becomes a parody of the 1968 animated film ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]''. The crew flies by bits of the [[E (mathematical constant)|number e]] then smashes back out through the screen and into the real world.\n\n===DVD===\nThe DVD features an Audio Commentary, Storyboard Animatic, Futurama Genetics Lab, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and Futurama featurette, How to draw ''Futurama'' in 83 easy steps Featurette, Deleted scene, 3D Model with Animator Discussion, Outtakes, Bender's Anti-Piracy Warning and sneak peek at ''[[Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder]]''. Easter Eggs show David X. Cohen displaying a collection of different Polyhedrons, and extra outtakes of Billy West.\n\nThe Blu-ray also exclusively features Picture-in-Picture video footage of the commentary.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{official website|http://www.ilovebender.com|''Futurama: Bender's Game''}}\n* {{IMDb title|1054486}}\n* {{Amg title|467010}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|futurama_benders_game}}\n* ''[[Infosphere:Bender's Game|Bender's Game]]'' at ''The Infosphere''.\n\n{{Matt Groening}}\n{{Futurama}}\n{{Futurama episodes|5}}\n{{Rough Draft Studios}}\n{{20th Century Fox Animation}}\n\n[[Category:20th Century Fox animated films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox Television films]]\n[[Category:2000s American animated films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2008 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2008 direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:2008 films]]\n[[Category:2009 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Adult animated comedy films]]\n[[Category:Adult animated science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American adult animated films]]\n[[Category:American animated comedy films]]\n[[Category:American animated science fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American animated science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:Direct-to-video animated films]]\n[[Category:Dungeons & Dragons]]\n[[Category:Films about parallel universes]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Dwayne Carey-Hill]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Claudia Katz]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 31st century]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Eric Kaplan]]\n[[Category:Fox Television Animation films]]\n[[Category:Futurama (season 5) episodes]]\n[[Category:Futurama films]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth parodies]]\n[[Category:Rough Draft Studios films]]\n[[Category:The ULULU Company films]]\n[[Category:Works by David X.
