The film is about a French town where a number of citizens receive anonymous letters containing libelous information, particularly targeting a doctor accused of providing abortion services. The mystery surrounding the letters eventually escalates into violence.\n\nThe film caused serious problems for its director after [[World War II]] as it had been produced by [[Continental Films]], a German production company established near the beginning of the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Occupation of France]], and because the film had been perceived by the underground and the Communist press as vilifying the French people. Because of this, Clouzot was initially banned for life from directing in France, but after protests only until 1947. The film was suppressed until 1969.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Spotts |first1=Frederic |title=The Shameful Peace: How French Artists & Intellectuals Survived the Nazi Occupation |date=9 Dec 2008 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0300142372 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSBiE6g9VV4C&q=occupied+france+corbeaux+poison-pen&pg=PT327 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}</ref> It was [[remake|remade]] as ''[[The 13th Letter]]'' (1951) by [[Otto Preminger]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn a small French town identified as \"anywhere\", anonymous [[poison pen letter|poison pen]] letters are sent by somebody signing as \"''Le Corbeau''\" (the Raven). The letters start by accusing doctor R\u00e9my Germain of having an affair with Laura Vorzet, the pretty young wife of the elderly psychiatrist Dr. Vorzet. Germain is also accused of practising illegal [[Abortion in France|abortions]]. Letters are then sent to virtually all the population of the town, but keep getting back to the initial victim, Dr. Germain. The situation becomes increasingly serious when a patient of the hospital commits suicide with his [[straight razor]] after the Raven writes to him that his cancer is terminal.\n\nLaura Vorzet's sister Marie Corbin, a nurse in the infirmary, becomes a suspect and is arrested, but soon new letters arrive. When one letter is dropped in a church from a gallery, it becomes apparent the Raven must be one of the people seated there at the time. They are gathered to re-write the Raven's letters as dictated by Dr. Vorzet, to [[Graphology|compare the handwriting]]. Germain's lover Denise is suspected when she faints during the dictation, only for Laura to be identified by material found on her blotter.  Germain agrees to sign an order committing Laura as insane; he is called away to attend Denise, who has fallen downstairs, but before he leaves Laura protests she wrote the Raven's first letters before Dr. Vorzet began dictating them, making him the true Raven. Just as the ambulance takes Laura away, Germain returns to find Dr. Vorzet dead at his desk, his throat cut by the cancer patient's mother as he was writing the Raven's final, triumphant letter.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Pierre Fresnay]]: Doctor R\u00e9my Germain\n* [[Ginette Leclerc]]: Denise Saillens\n* [[Pierre Larquey]]: Doctor Michel Vorzet\n* [[H\u00e9l\u00e9na Manson]]: Marie Corbin\n* [[Pierre Bertin (actor)|Pierre Bertin]]: The Sub-Prefect\n* [[Liliane Maign\u00e9]]: Rolande Saillens\n* [[Roger Blin]]: Fran\u00e7ois, cancer patient, suicide\n* [[Micheline Francey]]: Laura Vorzet\n* [[Antoine Balp\u00eatr\u00e9]]: Doctor Delorme\n* [[Louis Seigner]]: Doctor Bertrand\n* [[No\u00ebl Roquevert]]: School Director Saillens\n* [[Jean Brochard]]: Bonnevie\n* [[Gustave Gallet]]: Fayolle\n* [[Bernard Lancret]]: The Postmaster Delorme\n* [[Sylvie (actress)|Sylvie]]: Mother of cancerous Francois\n* [[Jeanne Fusier-Gir]]: The Small-Wear Dealer\n* [[Nicole Chollet]]: Vorzet's Maid\n* [[Lucienne Bogaert]]: Woman\n* [[Palmyre Levasseur]]: Magistrate\n* [[Marcel Dela\u00eetre]]:  Preacher\n* [[Pierre Palau]]: The Postmaster\n* [[P\u00e2querette (actress)|P\u00e2querette]]\n* [[Marie-Jacqueline Chantal]]\n* [[Robert Clermont (actor)|Robert Clermont]]\n* [[\u00c9tienne Decroux]]\n* [[Paul Barge]]\n* [[Albert Brouett]]\n* [[Eug\u00e8ne Yvern\u00e8s]]\n* [[Albert Malbert]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film is loosely based on an anonymous letter case that had begun in the town of [[Tulle]], [[Limousin (region)|Limousin]], in 1917.

Clouzot previously worked with Fresnay on another Continental Films project, ''[[The Murderer Lives at Number 21]]'' (1942). Writer [[Joseph Kessel]] later criticised the film's Continental origins, noting ''Le Corbeau'' was funded by the Germans, and in that context could be seen as a statement on French corruption. Kessel questioned if the film would be made if it were set in Germany.<ref name=\"Kessel\">[[Joseph Kessel]], \"The ''Corbeau'' Affair (continued),\" ''[[L'Intransigeant]]'', 27 September 1947.</ref>\n\nIt was shot at the [[Billancourt Studios]] in [[Paris]] with location filming around [[Montfort-l'Amaury]].

The family's four- year-old son Gregory was abducted and found drowned in the river. The media labelled the anonymous killer (or killers) 'Le Corbeau'. No one has been apprehended for the crime. In 2006, the film enjoyed a resurgence in popularity in Paris after the [[Clearstream affair]], in which anonymous letters accused French politicians of having hidden bank accounts.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cinema of France]]\n*[[Andr\u00e9 Andrejew]]\n*[[Murder of Gr\u00e9gory Villemin]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0035753}}\n* {{Amg movie|28633}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|le_corbeau}}\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/312-le-corbeau ''Le Corbeau''] an essay by Alan Williams at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Henri-Georges Clouzot}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Corbeau, Le}}\n[[Category:1943 films]]\n[[Category:1940s mystery thriller films]]\n[[Category:1940s psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:French black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Film noir]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot]]\n[[Category:Films set in France]]\n[[Category:1940s French-language films]]\n[[Category:French psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Henri-Georges Clouzot]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Billancourt Studios]]\n[[Category:French mystery thriller films]]\n[[Category:Continental Films films]]\n[[Category:1940s French films]]"}]}}}}
