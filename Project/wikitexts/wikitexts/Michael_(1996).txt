The film stars [[John Travolta]] as the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]], who is sent to Earth to do various tasks, including mending some wounded hearts. The cast also includes [[Andie MacDowell]], [[William Hurt]], [[Bob Hoskins]], [[Joey Lauren Adams]], and [[Robert Pastorelli]] as people who cross Michael's path.\n\nThe original music score was composed by [[Randy Newman]]. The dance scene and other location shots were filmed at the community center of Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Cornhill, Texas, and on country roads near [[Walburg, Texas]], as well as at Texas' [[Gruene Hall]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe ''National Mirror'' is a tabloid publication that reports primarily on unexplainable phenomena. The editor, Vartan Malt, receives a story tip about a woman living with an angel in her house in a small town in Iowa, and decides to send three staff members to investigate. He chooses Frank Quinlan; Huey Driscoll, a photographer and owner of the ''Mirror'' star Sparky the Wonder Dog; and Dorothy Winters, hired by Malt to eventually replace Driscoll.\n\nAt the boarding house of Pansy Milbank, they meet her tenant [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]]. While Michael has wings and smells like cookies, he has an unexpected taste for cigarettes and sugar, seems rather boorish at first, and does not appear clean. When pressed for the type of angel he is, he replies he is an [[archangel]], with Pansy boasting he triumphed over [[Lucifer]] in the [[War in Heaven]].\n\nAfter Pansy unexpectedly dies, Frank and Huey decide to take Michael to Chicago. Michael reveals that this was his plan from the beginning. During the trip, Michael's mission on Earth is slowly revealed to be to get Frank and Dorothy together despite both having had bad experiences with love.\n\nAfter Sparky is hit by a truck and killed, Michael brings him back to life. In the process, he uses up his allotment of miracles and begins to weaken. The group reaches Chicago just in time for Michael to see the [[Willis Tower|Sears Tower]] (which he has always wanted to see) before disappearing. After Frank and Dorothy go their separate ways, Michael returns one more time (this time with Pansy in tow) and successfully gets Frank and Dorothy back together for good.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = left\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer    = [[John Travolta]] stars as the Archangel Michael. \n | footer_align = left\n | width     =\n | image1    = John Travolta 1997.jpg\n\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      = \n | image2    = Rublev Arhangel Mikhail.jpg\n | width2    = 143\n | alt2      = \n}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[John Travolta]] as [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]]<ref name=\"MorningCall\" />\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Dorothy Winters \n* [[William Hurt]] as Frank Quinlan \n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as Vartan Malt \n* [[Robert Pastorelli]] as Huey Driscoll \n* [[Jean Stapleton]] as Pansy Milbank \n* [[Teri Garr]] as Judge Esther Newberg \n* [[Wallace Langham]] as Bruce Craddock \n* [[Joey Lauren Adams]] as Anita, Brown's waitress\n* [[Richard Schiff]] as Italian waiter\n* [[Carla Gugino]] as Bride\n* [[Tom Hodges (actor)|Tom Hodges]] as Groom\n* Sparky as Himself\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Themes and interpretations==\nContrary to popular depictions of [[angel]]s, Michael is portrayed as a boozing, smoking slob \u2013 yet capable of imparting unexpected wisdom.<ref name=\"MorningCall\">{{cite news|title= Spotlight On John Travolta In 'Michael,' The Actor Plays A Sexy Angel Whose Gospel Is Wine, Women And Song |work= [[The Morning Call]]|url= http://articles.mcall.com/1996-12-21/news/3112964_1_angel-travolta-s-michael-shop|access-date=2010-11-23}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sebastiano Ricci 058.jpg|thumb|[[Michael (archangel)|Michael]]'s shield in the [[War in Heaven]], which Professor Christopher R.
