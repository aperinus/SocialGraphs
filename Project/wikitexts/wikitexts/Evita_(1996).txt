The film depicts the life of [[Eva Per\u00f3n]], detailing her beginnings, rise to fame, political career and death at the age of 33. Directed by [[Alan Parker]], and written by Parker and [[Oliver Stone]], ''Evita'' stars [[Madonna]] as Eva, [[Jonathan Pryce]] as Eva's husband [[Juan Per\u00f3n]], and [[Antonio Banderas]] as Ch\u00e9, an [[everyman]] who acts as the film's narrator.\n\nFollowing the release of the 1976 album, a [[film adaptation]] of the musical became mired in [[development hell]] for more than fifteen years, as the rights were passed on to several major studios, and various directors and actors considered. In 1993, producer [[Robert Stigwood]] sold the rights to [[Andrew G. Vajna]], who agreed to finance the film through his production company [[Cinergi Pictures]], with [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]] distributing the film through [[Hollywood Pictures]]. After Stone stepped down from the project in 1994, Parker agreed to write and direct the film. Recording sessions for the songs and [[Evita (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] took place at CTS Studios in London, England, roughly four months before filming. Parker worked with Rice and Lloyd Webber to compose the soundtrack, reworking the original songs by creating the music first and then the lyrics. They also wrote a new song, \"[[You Must Love Me]]\", for the film. [[Principal photography]] commenced in February 1996 with a budget of $55 million, and concluded in May of that year. Filming took place on locations in [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Budapest]], and on soundstages at [[Shepperton Studios]]. The film's production in Argentina was met with controversy, as the cast and crew faced protests over fears that the project would tarnish Eva's image.\n\n''Evita'' premiered at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles, California, on December 14, 1996. Hollywood Pictures gave the film a [[Limited release#Platform release|platform release]], which involved releasing it in select cities before expanding distribution in the following weeks. The film had a [[limited release]] on December 25, 1996, before opening [[wide release|nationwide]] on January 10, 1997. It grossed over $141 million worldwide. The film received a mixed critical response; reviewers praised Madonna's performance, the music, costume designs and cinematography, while criticism was aimed at the pacing and direction. ''Evita'' received many [[List of accolades received by Evita (1996 film)|awards and nominations]], including the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] (\"You Must Love Me\"), and three [[Golden Globe Award]]s for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture&nbsp;\u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Picture&nbsp;\u2013 Comedy or Musical]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] (\"You Must Love Me\") and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress&nbsp;\u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress&nbsp;\u2013 Comedy or Musical]] (Madonna).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words. -->\nAt a cinema in [[Buenos Aires]] on July 26, 1952, a film is interrupted when news breaks of the death of [[Eva Per\u00f3n]], Argentina's [[First Ladies and Gentlemen of Argentina|First Lady]], at the age of 33. As the nation goes into public mourning, Ch\u00e9, a member of the public, marvels at the spectacle and promises to show how Eva did \"nothing for years\". The rest of the film follows Eva (n\u00e9e Duarte) from her beginnings as an illegitimate child of a lower-class family to her rise to become First Lady; Ch\u00e9 assumes many different guises throughout Eva's story.\n\nAt the age of 15, Eva lives in the provincial town of [[Jun\u00edn, Buenos Aires|Jun\u00edn]], and longs for a better life in Buenos Aires. She persuades a tango singer, [[Agust\u00edn Magaldi]], with whom she is having an affair, to take her to the city. After Magaldi leaves her, she goes through several relationships with increasingly influential men, becoming a model, actress and radio personality. She meets Colonel [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] at a fundraiser following the [[1944 San Juan earthquake]]. Per\u00f3n's connection with Eva adds to his populist image, since they are both from the working class. Eva has a radio show during Per\u00f3n's rise and uses all of her skills to promote him, even when the controlling administration has him jailed in an attempt to stunt his political momentum. The groundswell of support that Eva generates forces the government to release Per\u00f3n, and he finds the people enamored of him and Eva. Per\u00f3n wins election to the [[President of Argentina|presidency]] and marries Eva, who promises that the new government will serve the ''[[descamisados]]''.\n\nAt the start of the Per\u00f3n government, Eva dresses glamorously, enjoying the privileges of being the First Lady. Soon after, she embarks on what is called her \"Rainbow Tour\" of Europe. While there, she receives a mixed reception. The people of Spain adore her, the people of Italy call her a whore and throw things at her, and [[Pope Pius XII]] gives her a small, meager gift. Upon returning to Argentina, Eva establishes a foundation to help the poor. The film suggests the [[Peronism|Per\u00f3nists]] otherwise plunder the public treasury.\n\nEva is hospitalized and learns that she has terminal cancer. She declines the position of Vice President due to her failing health, and makes one final broadcast to the people of Argentina. She understands that her life was short because she shone like the \"brightest fire\", and helps Per\u00f3n prepare to go on without her. A large crowd surrounds the [[Quinta de Olivos]] in a candlelight vigil praying for her recovery when the light of her room goes out, signifying her death. At Eva's funeral, Ch\u00e9 is seen at her coffin, marveling at the influence of her brief life. He walks up to her glass coffin, kisses it, and joins the crowd of passing mourners.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Madonna]] as [[Eva Per\u00f3n]]\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as Ch\u00e9\n* [[Jonathan Pryce]] as [[Juan Per\u00f3n]]\n* [[Jimmy Nail]] as [[Agust\u00edn Magaldi]]\n* Victoria Sus as Do\u00f1a Juana Ibarguren\n* Julian Littman as Juancito Duarte\n* [[Olga Merediz]] as Bianca Duarte\n* Laura Pallas as Elisa Duarte\n* Julia Worsley as Erminda Duarte\n* [[Peter Polycarpou]] as [[Domingo Mercante]]\n* [[Gary Brooker]] as [[Juan Atilio Bramuglia]]\n* [[Andrea Corr]] as Juan's mistress\n* [[Alan Parker]] as Tormented film director\n* [[Peter Hughes (actor)|Peter Hughes]] as [[General Francisco Franco]]\n}}\n\nCast taken from [[Turner Classic Movies]] listing of ''Evita''.<ref name=\"TCM\">{{cite web|title=Evita (1996)&nbsp;\u2013 Full Credits |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/300915/Evita/full-credits.html |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |access-date=November 30, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201082930/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/300915/Evita/full-credits.html |archive-date=December 1, 2016  }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Failed projects: 1976\u20131986===\n[[File:Eva Per\u00f3n Retrato Oficial.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eva Per\u00f3n]] (1919\u20131952), whose life and political career inspired the musical ''Evita'' and its film adaptation.|alt=Portrait of Eva Per\u00f3n.]]\nFollowing the release of ''[[Evita (album)|Evita]]'' (1976), a [[sung-through]] [[concept album]] by [[Tim Rice]] and [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] detailing the life of Eva Per\u00f3n, director [[Alan Parker]] met with their manager [[David Land]], asking if Rice and Lloyd Webber had thought of making a film version.
