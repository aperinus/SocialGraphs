It is based on the [[Uncle Remus]] stories as adapted by [[Joel Chandler Harris]], and stars [[James Baskett]] as Uncle Remus in his final film role. The film takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] during the [[Reconstruction era]], a period of American history after the end of the [[American Civil War]] and the abolition of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. The story follows seven-year-old Johnny ([[Bobby Driscoll]]) who is visiting his grandmother's [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] for an extended stay. Johnny befriends Uncle Remus, an elderly worker on the plantation, and takes joy in hearing his tales about the adventures of [[Br'er Rabbit]], [[Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear|Br'er Fox, and Br'er Bear]]. Johnny learns from the stories how to cope with the challenges he is experiencing while living on the plantation.\n\nWalt Disney had wanted to produce a film based on the Uncle Remus stories for some time. It was not until 1939 that he began negotiating with the Harris family for the film rights, and in 1944, filming for ''Song of the South'' began. The studio constructed a plantation set for the outdoor scenes in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], while other scenes were filmed in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]]. The film is predominantly live action, but includes three animated segments, which were later released as stand-alone television features. Some scenes also feature a combination of live action with animation. ''Song of the South'' premiered in Atlanta in November 1946 and the remainder of its initial theater run was a financial success. The song  \"[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]\" won the 1948 [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1948 |title=1948 &#124; Oscars.org &#124; Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |publisher=Oscars.org |date=1948-03-20 |access-date=2021-01-19}}</ref> and Baskett received an [[Academy Honorary Award]] for his performance as Uncle Remus.\n\nSince its initial release the film has attracted controversy, with critics characterizing its portrayal of [[African Americans]] and plantation life as [[Racism in the United States|racist]]. As a result of the film's controversial legacy, Disney has not released ''Song of the South'' on any [[home video]] format in the United States, and the film has never been available on its streaming platform [[Disney+]]. Some of the musical and animated sequences have been released through other means, and the full film has seen home video distribution in other countries. The cartoon characters from the film continued to appear in a variety of books, comics, and other Disney media for many decades after the film's release. Disney's theme park ride [[Splash Mountain]], first opened in 1989, is based on the film's animated sequences.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n=== Setting ===\nThe film is set on a [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], part of the [[Southern United States]]; specifically in a location some distance from [[Atlanta]]. Although sometimes misinterpreted as taking place [[antebellum South|before the American Civil War]] while [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] was still legal in the region, the film takes place during the [[Reconstruction Era]] after slavery was abolished.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Kaufman | first = Will | title = The Civil War in American Culture | publisher = [[Edinburgh University Press]] | year = 2006 | location = Edinburgh | isbn = 0-7486-1935-6}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Langman | first1 = Larry | last2 = Ebner | first2 = David | title = Hollywood's Image of the South: A Century of Southern Films | publisher = [[Greenwood Press]] | year = 2001 | location = Westport Connecticut, London | page = 169 | isbn = 0-313-31886-7}}</ref> Harris's original Uncle Remus stories were all set after the [[American Civil War]] and the abolition of slavery. Born in 1848, Harris himself was a racial reconciliation activist writer and journalist of the Reconstruction Era. The film makes several indirect references to the Reconstruction Era: clothing is in the newer [[1870s in fashion|late-Victorian style]]; Uncle Remus is free to leave the plantation at will; black field hands are [[sharecropper]]s, etc.<ref name=\"Promotional Program Page 7\">''Walt Disney Presents \"Song of the South\"'' Promotional Program, Page 7. Published 1946 by Walt Disney Productions/RKO Radio Pictures.</ref>\n\n=== Plot ===\nSeven-year-old Johnny is excited about what he believes to be a vacation at his grandmother's Georgia plantation with his parents, Sally and John Sr. When they arrive at the plantation, he discovers that his parents will be living apart temporarily, and he will live at the plantation with his mother and grandmother while his father returns to Atlanta to continue his controversial editorship of that city's newspaper. Distraught at his father's departure, Johnny secretly leaves for Atlanta that night with only a [[bindle]].\n\nAs Johnny sneaks away from the plantation, he discovers [[Uncle Remus]] telling tales of a character named [[Br'er Rabbit]] to other sharecroppers on the plantation. By this time, word had gotten out that Johnny was missing, and some plantation residents are looking for him. Johnny evades being discovered, but Uncle Remus catches up with him, offers him food for his journey, and takes him back to his cabin, where he tells the boy the traditional African-American folktale, \"[[Br'er Rabbit Earns a Dollar a Minute]]\". In the story, Br'er Rabbit attempts to run away from home only to change his mind after an encounter with [[Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear]]. Johnny takes the advice and lets Uncle Remus take him back to Sally.\n\nJohnny makes friends with Toby, a young black boy who lives on the plantation, and Ginny Favers, a poor white girl. Ginny gives Johnny a puppy after her two older brothers, Joe and Jake, threaten to drown it. Sally refuses to let him take care of the puppy, so he takes it to Uncle Remus. Uncle Remus takes the dog in and delights Johnny and his friends with [[Tar-Baby|the fable of Br'er Rabbit and the Tar-Baby]], stressing that people should not get involved with something they have no business with in the first place. Johnny imitates Br'er Rabbit's use of [[reverse psychology]] from the tale and begs the Favers brothers not to tell their mother about the dog. The trick works and the boys get in trouble after telling their mother. In an act of revenge, they tell Sally about the dog. Sally becomes upset that Johnny and Uncle Remus kept the dog despite her order (which was unknown to Uncle Remus), and she instructs Uncle Remus not to tell any more stories to her son.\n\nJohnny's birthday arrives and Johnny picks up Ginny to take her to his party. On the way there, Joe and Jake push Ginny into a mud puddle. With her dress ruined, Ginny is unable to go to the party and runs off crying. Johnny begins fighting with the boys, but their fight is broken up by Uncle Remus, who scolds Joe and Jake. Johnny runs off to comfort Ginny. He explains that he does not want to go to the party either, especially since his father will not be there. Uncle Remus discovers both dejected children and cheers them up by telling the story of [[The Laughing Place|Br'er Rabbit and his \"Laughing Place\"]]. When the three return to the plantation, Sally becomes angry at Johnny for missing his party, and tells Uncle Remus to stay away from him. Saddened by the misunderstanding of his good intentions, Uncle Remus packs his bags and begins to leave for Atlanta. Johnny rushes to intercept him, but is attacked by a bull and seriously injured after taking a shortcut through a pasture. While Johnny hovers between life and death, his father returns. Johnny calls for Uncle Remus, and his grandmother escorts him in. Uncle Remus begins telling a Br'er Rabbit tale, and the boy miraculously survives.\n\nLater, a fully recovered Johnny sings with Ginny and Toby while Johnny's returned puppy runs alongside them. Nearby, Uncle Remus is shocked when Br'er Rabbit and several of the other characters from his stories appear in front of them and interact with the children. Uncle Remus rushes to join the group, and, together, they all walk into the sunset.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Remuskids.jpg|thumb|Clockwise from left: Ginny ([[Luana Patten]]), Uncle Remus ([[James Baskett]]), Johnny ([[Bobby Driscoll]]), and Toby (Glenn Leedy)]]\n{{Div col}}\n* [[James Baskett]] as [[Uncle Remus]]\n* [[Bobby Driscoll]] as Johnny\n* [[Luana Patten]] as Ginny Favers\n* Glenn Leedy as Toby\n* [[Ruth Warrick]] as Sally\n* [[Lucile Watson]] as Grandmother\n* [[Hattie McDaniel]] as Aunt Tempe\n* Erik Rolf as John\n* Olivier Urbain as Mr. Favers (uncredited)\n* [[Mary Field]] as Mrs. Favers\n* Anita Brown as Maid\n* George Nokes as Jake Favers\n* Gene Holland as Joe Favers\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Voices ===\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Johnny Lee (actor)|Johnny Lee]] as [[Br'er Rabbit]]\n* [[James Baskett]] as [[Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear|Br'er Fox]] (also Br'er Rabbit in the \"Laughing Place\" segment)\n* [[Nick Stewart]] as [[Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear|Br'er Bear]]\n* [[Roy Glenn]] as Br'er Frog (uncredited)\n* [[Clarence Nash]] as Bluebird (uncredited)\n* Helen Crozier as Mother Possum (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Development ==\nIn the aftermath of World War II, Walt Disney Studios faced financial difficulties due to a lack of foreign markets for animated films during wartime. The studio produced few theatrical animated shorts then, focusing instead on military training films that broke even, but produced no profit. The studio only profited in 1945 and 1946 by reissuing ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' and ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', and still had to lay off half of its employees in 1946. With additional financial difficulties due to a [[Disney animators' strike|union strike]] in 1941, Disney sought to produce live-action films to generate additional revenue. While Disney's contract with RKO was for animated films, films that mixed live-action with animation fell under the contract, allowing the studio to lower production costs on ''[[Saludos Amigos]]'' and ''[[The Three Caballeros]]''. Additionally, Disney owned the rights to several properties purchased after the success of ''Snow White'', which could be made into family films.{{sfn|Korkis|2012|pp=21\u20136}}\n\nIn 1938, Disney became interested in the Joel Chandler Harris Uncle Remus storybook, claiming to remember hearing the stories as a child, and prepared two research reports to determine if it was possible to film the stories, dated April 8 and 11, 1938. He purchased the rights to the stories in 1939, paying Harris's family $10,000 ({{Inflation|US|10000|1938|r=-3|fmt=eq}}). By 1986, the film based on the stories, ''Song of the South'', had earned $300 million.{{sfn|Korkis|2012|pp=21\u20136}}\n\nBeginning in 1939, Disney began developing ''Uncle Remus'' as an entirely animated feature. The stories were also considered as two-reel animated shorts. Stories considered for the production included \"Br'er Rabbit Rides the Fox\u201d, in which Br'er Rabbit tricks Br'er Fox into riding him like a horse to a party, and \"De Wuller-De-Wust\", in which Br'er Rabbit pretends to be a ghost to scare Br'er Bear. In another treatment, Uncle Remus gathers the critters together for a prayer meeting and to encourage them to build a church that would bring peace between predators and prey. Also proposed was a storyline in which Br'er Rabbit's addiction to gambling would be at the root of the troubles that led to the film's adventures.{{sfn|Korkis|2012|pp=21\u20136}}\n\nDisney first began to negotiate with Harris's family for the rights in 1939, and by late summer of that year he already had one of his storyboard artists summarize the more promising tales and draw up four boards' worth of story sketches. In November 1940, Disney visited the Harris's home in Atlanta. He told ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that he wanted to \"get an authentic feeling of Uncle Remus country so we can do as faithful a job as possible to these stories.\"{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=433}} [[Roy Oliver Disney|Roy O. Disney]] had misgivings about the project, doubting that it was \"big enough in caliber and natural draft\" to warrant a budget over $1 million and more than twenty-five minutes of animation. Walt Disney planned to produce a series of Uncle Remus films if the first one was successful, each with the same live-action cast but different animated shorts. Ultimately, the studio decided that only a third of the film would be animated and the rest would be live-action.{{sfn|Korkis|2012|pp=21\u20136}}\n\nDisney was initially going to have the screenplay written by the studio animators, but later sought professional writers.{{sfn|Korkis|2012|pp=21\u20136}} In June 1944, Disney hired Southern-born writer Dalton Reymond to write the screenplay, and he met frequently with [[King Vidor]], whom he was trying to interest in directing the live-action sequences.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=433}}\n\nDalton Reymond delivered a 51-page outline on May 15, 1944.{{sfn|Korkis|2012|pp=27\u201334}} [[Motion Picture Production Code|The Hays Office]] reviewed Reymond's outline, and demanded that some terminology, such as characters referring to Remus as an \"old darkie\" be removed from Reymond's treatment.{{sfn|Korkis|2012|pp=67\u201374}}\n\nDisney hired African-American performer and writer [[Clarence Muse]] to be consulted on the screenplay, but Muse quit when Reymond ignored Muse's suggestions to portray African-American characters in a way that would be perceived as being dignified and more than Southern stereotypes.{{sfn|Korkis|2012|pp=27\u201334}} Muse subsequently wrote letters to the editors of black publications to criticize the depiction of African-Americans in Reymond's script. Disney claimed that Muse attacked the film because Disney did not choose Muse to play the part of Uncle Remus, which Muse had lobbied for.{{sfn|Korkis|2012|pp=67\u201374}}\n\nFurthermore, Walter White, executive secretary of the NAACP, and June Blythe, the director of the American Council on Race Relations, were denied requests to see a treatment for the film.{{sfn|Korkis|2012|pp=67\u201374}}\n\nIn addition to concerns about his racial stereotyping, Reymond had never written a screenplay before (nor would he write another). [[Maurice Rapf]], who had been writing live-action features at the time, was asked by [[the Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]] to work with Reymond and co-writer Callum Webb to turn the treatment into a shootable screenplay.<ref name=\"Cohen\">{{Cite book | last = Cohen | first = Karl F. | title = Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America | publisher = [[McFarland & Company]], Inc. | year = 1997 | location = [[Jefferson, North Carolina]] | page = 64 | isbn = 0-7864-2032-4}}</ref> According to [[Neal Gabler]], one of the reasons Disney had hired Rapf to work with Reymond was to temper what Disney feared would be Reymond's \"white Southern slant\".{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=434}}\n\nReymond's treatment included the phrases \"massa\", in reference to white characters, and \"darkey\", in reference to plantation workers, prominently.{{sfn|Korkis|2012|pp=27\u201334}} Rapf removed the offending phrase and added dialogue to make it clear that the film was set after slavery had ended; one character in Rapf's script states, in reference to the black plantation workers, \"We gotta pay these people. They're not slaves.\" Uncle Remus also states, after being told that he cannot read any more stories to Johnny, \"I'm a free man; I don't have to take this.\"{{sfn|Korkis|2012|pp=27\u201334}}\n\nRapf saw the animal stories as metaphors for slave resistance, and intended to portray Br'er Rabbit as a smaller, less powerful black man, and in place of the oppressive whites would be Br'er Fox, Br'er Bear and the deleted character Br'er Coon.{{sfn|Korkis|2012|pp=27\u201334}}\n{{blockquote|Rapf was a minority, a Jew, and an outspoken [[Left-wing politics|left-winger]], and he himself feared that the film would inevitably be [[Uncle Tom#Epithet|Uncle-Tomish]]. \"That's exactly why I want you to work on it,\" Walt told him, \"because I know that you don't think I should make the movie. You're against Uncle Tomism, and you're a radical.\"{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=434}}}}\n\nRapf initially hesitated, but when he found out that most of the film would be live-action and that he could make extensive changes, he accepted the offer. Rapf worked on ''Uncle Remus'' for about seven weeks. When he got into a personal dispute with Reymond, Rapf was taken off the project.<ref name=\"Cohen\" /> According to Rapf, Disney \"ended every conference by saying 'Well, I think we've really licked it now.' Then he'd call you the next morning and say, 'I've got a new idea.' And he'd have one. Sometimes the ideas were good, sometimes they were terrible, but you could never really satisfy him.\"{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=433}} Morton Grant was assigned to the project.<ref name=\"Cohen\" /> Disney sent out the script for comment both within the studio and outside the studio.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=434\u20135}}\n\nOn May 10, 1944, the title was changed from ''Uncle Remus'' to ''Song of the South''.{{sfn|Korkis|2012|pp=27\u201334}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Casting ===\nIn February 1941, Disney talked with [[Paul Robeson]] about him playing Uncle Remus, and the two remained in talks about the project for several years, but ultimately he was not cast. It is speculated that Robeson's politics made him too controversial for the role. Other actors considered included Rex Ingram.{{sfn|Korkis|2012|pp=21\u20136}} Clarence Muse lobbied for the role of Uncle Remus while consulting on the screenplay, but left the project due to Dalton Reymond's depiction of African-Americans in the original treatment.{{sfn|Korkis|2012|pp=67\u201374}}\n\n[[James Baskett]] was cast as Uncle Remus after responding to an ad for providing the voice of a talking butterfly. Baskett is quoted as saying; \"I thought that, maybe, they'd try me out to furnish the voice for one of Uncle Remus's animals.\" Upon review of his voice, Disney wanted to meet Baskett personally, and had him tested for the role of Uncle Remus. In addition to the role of Uncle Remus, Baskett also received the voice roles of the butterfly and Br'er Fox.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.songofthesouth.net/movie/biographies/baskett.html|title=James Baskett as Uncle Remus|publisher=Song of the South.net|access-date=January 18, 2007}}</ref> Baskett also filled in as the voice of [[Br'er Rabbit]] for [[Johnny Lee (actor)|Johnny Lee]] in the \"Laughing Place\" scene after Lee was called away to do promotion for the film.<ref name=\"IMDb-2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038969/trivia|title=Trivia for ''Song of the South''|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|access-date=January 18, 2007}}</ref> Disney liked Baskett, and told his sister Ruth that Baskett was \"the best actor, I believe, to be discovered in years\". After the film's release, Disney maintained contact with Baskett. Disney also campaigned for Baskett to be given an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for his performance, saying that he had worked \"almost wholly without direction\" and had devised the characterization of Remus himself. Baskett won an honorary Oscar in 1948.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=438}} After Baskett's death, his widow wrote Disney and told him that he had been a \"friend indeed and [we] certainly have been in need\".{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=438\u20139}}\n\nAlso cast in the production were child actors [[Bobby Driscoll]], [[Luana Patten]], and Glenn Leedy (his only credited screen appearance).

Filming began in December 1944 in Phoenix, Arizona where the studio had constructed a plantation and cotton fields for outdoor scenes, and Disney left for the location to oversee what he called \"atmospheric shots\". Back in Hollywood, the live action scenes were filmed at the [[Samuel Goldwyn Studio]].{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=436}}\n\nOn the final day of shooting, Jackson discovered that the scene in which Uncle Remus sings the film's signature song, \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\", had not been properly [[blocking (stage)|blocked]]. According to Jackson, \"We all sat there in a circle with the dollars running out, and nobody came up with anything. Then Walt suggested that they shoot Baskett in close-up, cover the lights with cardboard save for a sliver of blue sky behind his head, and then remove the cardboard from the lights when he began singing so that he would seem to be entering a bright new world of animation. Like Walt's idea for [[Bambi#Production|Bambi on ice]], it made for one of the most memorable scenes in the film.\"{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=437}}\n\n=== Animation ===\n[[File:Laughingplace.jpg|thumb|[[Br'er Rabbit]] takes [[Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear]] to his \"[[The Laughing Place|laughing place]]\"]]\nThere are three animated segments in the film (they total 25 minutes). The last few minutes of the film also combines animation with live-action. The three sequences were later shown as stand-alone cartoon features on television.\n* ''Br'er Rabbit Runs Away'': (~8 minutes) Based on \"[[Br'er Rabbit Earns a Dollar a Minute]]\". Includes the song \"[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]\",\n* ''Br'er Rabbit and the Tar Baby'': (~12 minutes) Based on \"[[Tar-Baby]]\". The segment is interrupted with a short live-action scene about two-thirds through. It features the song \"How Do You Do?\"\n* ''Br'er Rabbit's Laughing Place'': (~5 minutes) Based on \"[[The Laughing Place]]\".
