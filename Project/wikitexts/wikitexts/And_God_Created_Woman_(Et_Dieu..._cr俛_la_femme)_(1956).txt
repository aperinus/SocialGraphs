Though not her first film, it is widely recognized as the vehicle that launched Bardot into the public spotlight and immediately created her \"[[sex kitten]]\" persona, making her an overnight sensation.\n\nWhen the film was released in the United States by [[Kingsley-International Pictures]] in 1957, it pushed the boundaries of the [[Sex in film|representation of sexuality in American cinema]], and most available prints of the film were heavily edited to conform with the [[Hays Code]] censorial standards.<ref>{{AllMovie title|2195|And God Created Woman}}.</ref>\n\nAn English-language remake also titled ''[[And God Created Woman (1988 film)|And God Created Woman]]'' was directed by Vadim and released in 1988.\n\n==Plot==\nThe action is set in St Tropez. Juliette is an 18-year-old [[orphan]] in [[Saint-Tropez]], [[France]],<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stephens|first=Chuck|title=And God Created Woman|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/80-and-god-created-woman|access-date=2021-09-06|website=The Criterion Collection|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=And God Created Woman|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/67302/and-god-created-woman/|access-date=2021-09-06|website=www.tcm.com|language=en}}</ref> with a high level of sexual energy. She makes no effort to restrain her natural sensuality &ndash; lying nude in her yard, habitually kicking her shoes off and stalking about barefoot, and disregarding many societal conventions and the opinions of others. This behavior causes a stir and attracts the attention of most of the men around her.\n\nHer first suitor is the much older and wealthy Eric Carradine. He wants to build a new casino in St Tropez, but his plans are blocked by a small shipyard on the stretch of land which he needs for the development; the shipyard is owned by the Tardieu family.\n\nAntoine, the eldest of the three Tardieu brothers, returns home for the weekend to hear Carradine's proposal and Juliette is waiting for him to take her away with him. His intentions are short-term, and he spurns her by leaving St Tropez without her.\n\nTiring of her outrageous behavior, Juliette's guardians threaten to send her back to the orphanage, which will confine her until she is 21. To keep her in town, Carradine pleads unsuccessfully with Antoine to marry her. His infatuated and naive younger brother Michel sees his opportunity and proposes marriage to Juliette. Despite her love for Antoine, she accepts.\n\nWhen Antoine is contracted to return home and work for Carradine, Juliette's behavior becomes increasingly disrespectful of her husband. In a huff, she takes one of the family's boats. When it develops engine trouble, she has to be saved by Antoine. Washed up together on a wild beach, she seduces him.\n\nJuliette begins acting bizarrely. She takes to her bed, claiming to have a fever. She tells Christian, the youngest Tardieu brother, that she had sex with Antoine on the beach. Madame Tardieu, mother of the three boys, hears about it, tells Michel that he has to kick Juliette promptly. Michel goes to their room to talk with Juliette, but she has gone off to the Bar des Amis to drink and dance.\n\nMichel tries to go looking for her, but Antoine locks him inside, telling him to forget her. Michel fights his brother for the key and heads out after Juliette.\n\nEric has been alerted that Juliette is making a spectacle of herself and comes to the bar to collect her. Juliette refuses to leave with him. Michel arrives but Juliette refuses to talk with him and continues an improvised and sexually suggestive dancing. When she ignores Michel's order to stop, Michel shoots at her. Eric steps in and is slightly wounded. Antoine offers to drive Eric to a doctor and they leave. Michel angrily slaps Juliette four times. She only smiles at him with satisfaction that she has provoked him to this behavior. En route to the doctor, Eric tells Antoine that he is going to reassign him to work elsewhere to put some distance between him and Michel and Juliette. He says: \"That girl was made to destroy men\". In the final scene, Michel and Juliette walk home together, hand in hand.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Brigitte Bardot]] as Juliette Hardy\n* [[Curd J\u00fcrgens]] as \u00c9ric Carradine\n* [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] as Michel Tardieu \n* [[Marie Glory]] as Mme.

Producer Raoul Levy wanted Vadim to write and direct a film starring Bardot, and suggested he adapt the book ''The Little Genius'' by [[Maurice Gar\u00e7on]]. Vadim disliked the book and came up with a new story, one based on a trial of a woman who had been the mistress of three different brothers, and who killed one of them. Vadim was particularly taken with the attitude of the woman towards her lovers, the jury and the police. Levy liked Vadim's idea and obtained finance.<ref name=\"roger\">{{Cite book|pages=78\u201394|first=Roger|last=Vadim|title=Bardot, Deneuve, Fonda|year=1986 |publisher=Simon and Schuster}}</ref>\n\nLevy succeeded in raising finance from Columbia, who would provide color and CinemaScope provided Curt Jurgens was given a role. The parts of the brothers had already been cast so Vadim rewrote the script in two days to expand the part of an arms dealer so it could be offered to Jurgens.<ref name=\"roger\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was a big hit in France, one of the ten most popular films at the British box-office in its year of release<ref>Most Popular Film of the Year.

The [[Catholic Legion of Decency]] gave it a \"C\" for \"Condemned\" rating. A Columbia spokesman stated that the film would have received twice as many bookings with a less restrictive \"B\" rating, but would only have done half the business.<ref>pp. 114-115 Balio, Tino ''The Foreign Film Renaissance on American Screens, 1946\u20131973'' University of Wisconsin Press; 1st Edition (November 5, 2010).</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nWhen the film was released in the United States, [[Bosley Crowther]], the film critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', found Brigitte Bardot attractive but the film lacking and was not able to recommend it. He wrote: \"Bardot moves herself in a fashion that fully accentuates her charms. She is undeniably a creation of superlative craftsmanship. But that's the extent of the transcendence, for there is nothing sublime about the script of this completely single-minded little picture. ...We can't recommend this little item as a sample of the best in Gallic films. It is clumsily put together and rather bizarrely played. There is nothing more than sultry fervor in the performance of Mlle. Bardot, and Christian Marquand and Jean-Louis Trintignant are mainly heavy-breathers as her men\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1957/10/22/archives/screen-french-import-brigitte-bardot-stars-in-god-created-woman.html|title=French Import: Brigitte Bardot Stars in ''God Created Woman''|work=The New York Times|date=22 October 1957|access-date=28 December 2020}}</ref>\n\nFilm critic Dennis Schwartz wrote: \"The breezy erotic drama was laced with some thinly textured sad moments that hardly resonated as serious drama. But as slight as the story was it was always lively and easy to take on the eyes, adding up to hardly anything more than a bunch of snapshots of Bardot posturing as a sex kitten in various stages of undress. The public loved it and it became a big box-office smash, and paved the way for a spate of sexy films to follow. What was more disturbing than its dullish dialogue and flaunting of Bardot as a sex object, was that underneath its call for liberation was a reactionary and sexist view of sex\".<ref>[http://www.sover.net/~ozus/andgodcreatedwoman.htm Schwartz, Dennis].

The by line is that of \"new bestselling French author Simone Colette\", but no such author ever existed. Rather it's a pseudonym for American authorship, devised to tie the trio of novelizations together. Whether it served as a single author pseudonym or a \"house name\" for several writers is unknown. The copyright is assigned to the publisher and screenwriters Vadim & L\u00e9vy are nowhere mentioned.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0049189}}\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/80-and-god-created-woman ''And God Created Woman''] an essay by Chuck Stephens at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Roger Vadim|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:And God Created Woman (1956 Film)}}\n[[Category:1956 films]]\n[[Category:1956 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:CinemaScope films]]\n[[Category:1956 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:Adultery in films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Roger Vadim]]\n[[Category:Films set in Saint-Tropez]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Saint-Tropez]]\n[[Category:1950s French-language films]]\n[[Category:French romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:1950s French films]]"}]}}}}
