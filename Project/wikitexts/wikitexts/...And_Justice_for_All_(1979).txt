[[Lee Strasberg]], [[Jeffrey Tambor]], [[Christine Lahti]], [[Craig T. Nelson]] and [[Thomas Waites]] appear in supporting roles. The [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated screenplay was written by [[Valerie Curtin]] and [[Barry Levinson]].\n\nThe film includes a well-known scene in which Pacino's character yells, \"''You're'' out of order! ''You're'' out of order! The ''whole trial'' is out of order! ''They're'' out of order!\" It was filmed in [[Baltimore]], including the courthouse area. It received two Academy Award nominations: [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Leading Actor]] (Pacino) and [[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] (Curtin and Levinson).\n\n==Plot==\nArthur Kirkland, a [[Baltimore]] defense attorney, is in jail on a contempt of court charge after punching Judge Henry T. Fleming while arguing the case of Jeff McCullaugh. McCullaugh was stopped for a minor traffic offense, then mistaken for a killer of the same name, and has already spent a year and a half in jail without being guilty of a crime. Fleming has repeatedly stymied Arthur's efforts to have the case reviewed. Although there is strong new evidence that McCullaugh is innocent, Fleming refuses to consider his appeal due to its late submission, so he remains in prison. Arthur then starts a new case, defending Ralph Agee, a young black [[Cross-dressing|cross-dresser]] arrested for a robbery, who is terrified of being sent to prison.\n\nArthur pays regular visits to his grandfather Sam, in a nursing home, who is progressively becoming senile. It is revealed that Arthur was abandoned by his parents at a young age, and it was Sam who raised him and put him through law school. Arthur Kirkland also begins a romance with a legal ethics committee member, Gail Packer.\n\nKirkland has a friendly relationship with Judge Francis Rayford, who takes him on a hair-raising ride in his personal helicopter. Rayford laughs in amusement as he tests how far he can fly before running out of fuel. Meanwhile, Arthur is terrified and begs him to land; Rayford eventually crashes his helicopter in knee-deep water. Rayford, a Korean War veteran, is borderline suicidal and keeps a rifle in his chambers at the courthouse and an [[M1911 pistol]] in his shoulder holster at all times. He even eats his lunch on a ledge outside his office window, four stories up.\n\nOne day, unexpectedly, Kirkland is requested to defend Judge Fleming, who has been accused of brutally assaulting and raping a young woman. As the two loathe each other, Fleming feels that having the person who publicly hates him argue his innocence will be to his advantage. Fleming blackmails Kirkland with an old violation of lawyer-client confidentiality, for which Kirkland will likely be disbarred if it were to come to light.\n\nKirkland's friend and partner, Jay Porter, is also unstable. He feels guilt for gaining acquittals for defendants who were truly guilty of violent crimes. Porter shows up drunk at Arthur's apartment, after one of his (guilty) clients kills two kids following his acquittal. After a violent breakdown inside the courthouse \u2013 wherein he ends up throwing dinner plates at everybody in the hallway \u2013 Porter is taken to a hospital. Before leaving in the ambulance, Kirkland asks another partner, Warren Fresnell, to handle Agee's court hearing in his absence. Kirkland gives Fresnell a corrected version of Agee's probation report and stresses that it must be shown to the judge so that Agee will receive probation, rather than serve jail time. Fresnell shows up late and forgets to give the judge the corrected version, causing Agee to be sentenced to jail time. Arthur is livid and attacks Fresnell's car, revealing that 30 minutes after he was sentenced, Agee committed suicide. Meanwhile, Jeff McCullaugh, who has been sexually and physically assaulted by other inmates, finally snaps and takes two hostages. Kirkland pleads with him to surrender, promising to get him out, but a police sniper shoots and kills McCullaugh when he moves in front of a window.\n\nA clearly disturbed Kirkland takes on Judge Fleming's case. He tries to talk the prosecuting attorney, Frank Bowers, into throwing the case out but Bowers, who recognizes the prestige that convicting a judge would earn him, refuses to back down. Kirkland meets with another client, Carl Travers, who offers photographs proving that Fleming engaged in [[BDSM]] acts with a prostitute. Gail Packer warns Kirkland not to betray a client, revealing that the ethics committee has been keeping their eye on him ever since the contempt of court incident. Arthur shows the pictures to Fleming, who freely admits he is guilty of the rape.\n\nAs the trial opens, Fleming, while looking at the victim, makes a casual remark to Kirkland that he \"wouldn't mind seeing her again sometime.\" Kirkland's face indicates his disgust. In his opening statement, Kirkland begins by mocking Bowers' case while speculating on the ultimate objective of the American legal system. He appears to be making a strong case to exonerate Fleming \u2013 but then, unexpectedly, he bursts out that the prosecution is not going to get Fleming, because ''he'' is going to get him and declares that his client is guilty. Judge Rayford yells that Kirkland is \"out of order,\" to which Kirkland retorts, \"''You're'' out of order! ''You're'' out of order! The ''whole trial'' is out of order! ''They're'' out of order!\" Kirkland is dragged out of the courtroom, venting his rage all the way and condemning Fleming for his and the legal system's abuse of the law. As the courtroom spectators cheer for Kirkland \u2013 including Gail Packer \u2013 Fleming sits down in defeat, and a fed-up Rayford storms out.\n\nIn the end, Arthur sits on the courthouse's steps, knowing his antics will probably cost him his career in law. An apparently uncured Jay Porter passes by, and tips his wig to Kirkland in a greeting, leaving him sitting on the steps in utter disbelief.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Arthur Kirkland\n* [[Jack Warden]] as Judge Francis Rayford\n* [[John Forsythe]] as Judge Henry T.
