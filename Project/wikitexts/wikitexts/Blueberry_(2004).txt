It is an adaptation of the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian comic book]] series ''[[Blueberry (comics)|Blueberry]]'', illustrated by [[Jean Giraud]] (better known as Moebius) and scripted by [[Jean-Michel Charlier]], but the film has little in common with the source material. The film starred [[Vincent Cassel]] as the title character along with [[Michael Madsen]] and [[Juliette Lewis]]. Although the film is a French production, the film is in English to match the story's setting in America's [[Wild West]] in the 1870s. Since the character of Blueberry remains obscure in the States, the film was released on DVD in America in November 2004 under the title ''Renegade'' and marketed very much as a conventional [[Western (genre)#Film|Western]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{more plot|date=December 2019}}\nU.S. Marshal Mike Donovan ([[Vincent Cassel]]) (referred to as Broken Nose by the aboriginal tribe; unlike the comic his nickname is not Blueberry) has dark memories of the death of his first love. He keeps peace between the whites and the aborigines who had temporarily adopted and taken care of him. The evil actions of Blount, a \"white sorcerer\" lead him to confront the villain in the Sacred Mountains, and, through shamanic rites involving an [[entheogen]]ic brew, conquer his fears and uncover a [[Recovered memory|suppressed memory]] he would much rather deny.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vincent Cassel]] as Mike Blueberry\n**[[Hugh O'Conor]] as Young Mike Blueberry\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Maria Sullivan\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Wallace Sebastian Blount\n* [[Temuera Morrison]] as Runi\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Rolling Star\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as Woodhead\n* [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]] as Greg Sullivan\n* [[Nichole Hiltz]] as Lola\n* Kateri Walker as Kateri\n* [[Vahina Giocante]] as Madeleine\n* [[Guillermo Ar\u00e9valo|Kestenbetsa]] as Kheetseen\n* [[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo]] as Uncle\n* [[Eddie Izzard]] as Prosit\n* [[Colm Meaney]] as Jimmy McClure\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Levantal]] as Pete\n\n==Production==\n[[Jean Giraud]], the famous [[Franco-Belgian comics]] creator and the illustrator of the original ''Blueberry'' comics, appears in a [[cameo role]] in the film, while [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]], who had appeared in several [[spaghetti Western]]s, and his daughter [[Juliette Lewis]] play a father and daughter in the movie.\n\nThe movie features several elaborate [[psychedelic (disambiguation)|psychedelic]] [[3D computer graphics]] sequences as a means of portraying Blueberry's shamanic experiences from his point of view. [[Jan Kounen]], the director of the film, drew upon his extensive firsthand knowledge of [[ayahuasca]] rituals in order to design the visuals for these sequences, Kounen having undergone the ceremony at least a hundred times <ref>{{cite AV media | last1=Jounen | first1=Jan | title=D'autres Mondes | year=2004}}</ref> with [[Shipibo]] language speakers in [[Peru]]. An authentic Shipibo ''ayahuasca'' guide appears in the film and performs a sacred chant. In the film, the exact nature of the [[entheogen]]ic sacramental liquid which Blueberry (and his enemy, Blount) drink remains undisclosed. During the final visionary scene, however, there is a bowl of leaves shown accompanied by a twisting vine which is probably the ayahuasca vine, ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]''. Historically, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s living in the [[Southwest United States]], would have had no geographic access to ayahuasca.\n\n[[Peyote]] is shown growing in the sacred areas throughout the film, and the buttons are prominently displayed at the end, although the viewer cannot be sure what Runi offers to the Marshal either time.\n\n==Reception==\n''Blueberry'' was not a critical success in the Anglophone world and received mostly negative reviews. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] it has a 22% rating based on reviews from 9 critics.<ref>{{cite web |title=Blueberry (2004) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/renegade_2004 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=1 April 2022 }}</ref>\n\nJamie Russell, of the BBC, felt the film was 'two parts bonkers to one part boring', and compared it to ''[[The Missing (2003 film)|The Missing]]'' by describing it as 'totally lost'.<ref name=\"Russell, Jamie\">{{cite web|last1=Russell|first1=Jamie|title=Blueberry|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2004/06/10/blueberry_2004_review.shtml%7Cpublisher=BBC.co.uk%7Caccess-date=27|website=BBC.co.uk|publisher=BBC|access-date=27 April 2016}}</ref> In his review for ''Cinopsis'', Eric Van Cutsem found that the film greatly disappointed the expectations of the large audiences of the original comic, being largely unrelated in both story and character.<ref name=\"Van Cutsem, Eric\">{{cite web|last1=Van Cutsem|first1=Eric|title=Blueberry|url=http://www.cinopsis.be/film/blueberry/|website=Cinopsis.be|publisher=Cinopsis|access-date=27 April 2016}}</ref> Rapha\u00ebl Jullien, of ''Abus de Cine'', felt the film's greatest weakness was that it was partly [[auteur]] experimentalism and partly genre western.<ref name=\"Rapha\u00ebl, Jullien\">{{cite web|last1=Rapha\u00ebl|first1=Jullien|title=Blueberry|url=http://www.abusdecine.com/critique/blueberry|website=abusdecine.com|publisher=Abus de Cine|access-date=27 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nSome reviewers found praise for ''Blueberry''. Lisa Nesselson, writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' was generally positive, noting the film demonstrated \"one of the most mystical approaches to the Western this side of ''[[El Topo]]'' and felt that the hallucinogenic climax of the film 'may be the closest this generation will get to having its own variation on the ''Stargate'' sequence in Kubrick's ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''\". Nesselson also noted that the film 'functions better as a purely visual journey than as the revelatory spiritual crucible it aspires to be'.<ref name=\"Nesselson, Lisa\">{{cite web|last1=Nesselson|first1=Lisa|title=Blueberry|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/markets-festivals/blueberry-1200536521/|website=Variety.com |date=11 February 2004|publisher=Variety|access-date=27 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n''Blueberry'' has managed to build a reputation as a cult success and as a trip film. [[French language]] cult cinema website Film de Culte awarded the film 5-out-of-6, noting the unusual goal of the [[antagonist]], 'the treasure sought by Wally Blount is not gold hidden in Indian mountains, but the spirit that emerges' through the quest of the [[protagonist]] as 'a man in search of his identity, his roots, openness to the world and, why not, to love'. The cinematography by [[Tetsuo Nagata]] was also referred to as 'sublime'.<ref name=\"Film de Cult\">{{cite web|title=Blueberry|url=http://archive.filmdeculte.com/film/film.php?id=771|website=FilmdeCult.com|publisher=Film de Cult|access-date=27 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702024737/http://archive.filmdeculte.com/film/film.php?id=771|archive-date=2 July 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Tripzine noted the film has 'the best, most accurate, most lovingly crafted shamanic rituals and psychedelic visuals ever created for home viewing', and praised ''Blueberry'''s uniqueness among westerns for having a climax that revolved around shamanic rite rather than a gun battle.<ref name=\"Kent, James\">{{cite web|last1=Kent|first1=James|title=Renegade, the best psychedelic western, ever|url=http://www.tripzine.com/listing.php?id=renegade|website=tripzine.com|publisher=TripZine|access-date=27 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films featuring hallucinogens]]\n* [[List of films based on French-language comics]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/celebrity_interviews/Blueberry-102.html Interview of Jean Giraud about the movie] {{in lang|fr}}\n\n{{Jan Kounen}}\n{{Jean Giraud}}\n\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2004 Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:2000s action films]]\n[[Category:Ayahuasca]]\n[[Category:British Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:British action films]]\n[[Category:English-language French films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about drugs]]\n[[Category:Films based on Belgian comics]]\n[[Category:Films based on French comics]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jan Kounen]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Thomas Langmann]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Almer\u00eda]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by G\u00e9rard Brach]]\n[[Category:French Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:French action films]]\n[[Category:Live-action films based on comics]]\n[[Category:Mexican Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:Supernatural thriller films]]\n[[Category:Superstition Mountains]]\n[[Category:Treasure hunt films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]\n[[Category:2000s Mexican films]]"}]}}}}
