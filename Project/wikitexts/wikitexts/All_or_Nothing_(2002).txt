Like much of Leigh's work, the film is set in present-day [[London]], and depicts three working-class families and their everyday lives.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film begins with a day nearing its end. Rachel, the daughter in the first family, is shown working in a nursing home. Phil, her father, is seen driving people around in his [[Taxicabs of the United Kingdom#Private hire .28.27minicabs.27.29|minicab]]. Penny, Rachel's mother, is shown working as a cashier at a [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]] store alongside Maureen, the mother in the second family. When Penny leaves work, she cycles home to find her 18-year-old son Rory in a fight with a local boy for taking his football.\n\nRory is a lazy, obese, ill-mannered teenager who neither goes to school nor has a job. Complications with his obesity arise when after an altercation with a gang of youths playing [[piggy in the middle]], he runs out of breath, begins to hyperventilate and is hospitalized after suffering a heart attack.\n\nThe second family consists of Maureen, another cashier at Safeway, and her daughter Donna, a waitress at a cafe. Donna becomes pregnant by her boyfriend Jason despite being on the [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|pill]], and this leads to a heated argument among the three characters.\n\nThe third family consists of Ron, who also drives a minicab, his unemployed teenage daughter Samantha, and his wife Carol, an unemployed alcoholic. Samantha shows interest in both Jason and Craig, a taciturn young man who seems to stalk her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Timothy Spall]] as Phil\n* [[Lesley Manville]] as Penny\n* [[James Corden]] as Rory\n* Alison Garland as Rachel\n* [[Ruth Sheen]] as Maureen\n* [[Marion Bailey]] as Carol\n* [[Paul Jesson]] as Ron\n* [[Sam Kelly]] as Sid\n* [[Kathryn Hunter]] as C\u00e9cile\n* [[Sally Hawkins]] as Samantha\n* Helen Coker as Donna\n* [[Daniel Mays]] as Jason\n* [[Ben Crompton]] as Craig\n* [[Robert Wilfort]] as Dr. Simon Griffith\n* [[Gary McDonald (actor)|Gary McDonald]] as Neville\n* [[Dorothy Atkinson]] as A Silent Passenger\n* [[Alan Williams (actor)|Alan Williams]] as Drunk\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Film locations==\n[[Dungeness (headland)|Dungeness]] in [[Kent]] was used as a film location for the scene where Phil visits the coast to contemplate his problems.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/2002/09/all-or-nothing-2002/|title=Kent Film Office All or Nothing Article}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIt was well received by critics and audiences alike, receiving an 82% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 92 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10.
