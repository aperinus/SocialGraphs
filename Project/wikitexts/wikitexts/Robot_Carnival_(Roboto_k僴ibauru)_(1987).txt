A boy finds a small \"coming soon\" poster advertising the Robot Carnival, and becomes frightened and agitated. He warns the people in his village, most likely to escape, when a huge machine with many robots performing in niches on its exterior grinds its way right over the village. Once a magnificent traveling [[Variety show|showcase]], it is now heavily rusted, damaged by decades of weathering in the desert, while its many machines wreak havoc as the village is destroyed beneath its might.\n\nIn the {{nihongo|\"Ending\"|\u30a8\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0|Endingu}} segment (the ninth segment of the OVA), the ''Robot Carnival'' is stopped by a dune in the desert. Unable to climb the sandy obstruction, the Carnival stalls at its base. As the sun sets over the traveling relic, flashback stills recall the grandeur of the Carnival at the peak of its existence \u2013 an unparalleled engine of mirth that brought timeless joy to the various cities it visited. At sunrise, the gigantic machine charges forward with a burst of power, and surmounts the dune. The final push proves to be too much for the aged contraption, and it finally goes to pieces in the desert. The bulk of the OVA's credits are then shown concluding with an epilogue.\n\nIn the epilogue at the end of the credits, set years later, a man discovers an orb among the remains and brings it back to his family. It is a [[music box]], featuring a miniature robot ballerina. As it dances, the children applaud. The ballerina finishes its dance with a leap into the air; the explosion that follows destroys the shack where the family lived, leaving \"END\" in enormous letters lying in its place. The family's pet [[llama]], the only survivor, struggles to regain its footing.\n\n;Staff\n:*Director / Scenario / Storyboards: [[Katsuhiro Otomo]],<ref name=\"alamo\">{{cite web | author=Salvaggio, Tony | date=January 5, 2004 | title=Anime at the Alamo | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2004-01-05/anime-at-the-alamo | publisher=[[Anime News Network]] | access-date=2011-06-26}}</ref> Atsuko Fukushima<ref>{{cite book |url=https://worldcat.org/title/robot-carnival/oclc/919219224 |title = Robot carnival (DVD video, 2015) [WorldCat.org]| oclc=919219224 }}</ref>\n:*Backgrounds: [[Niz\u014d Yamamoto]]\n:*Sound Effects: Kazutoshi Sat\u014d\n\n===\"Franken's Gears\"===\n{{nihongo|\"Franken's Gears\"|\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u306e\u6b6f\u8eca|Furanken no Haguruma}} was directed by [[K\u014dji Morimoto]].

Captured by the alien leader, he is tortured, but it is also revealed to be the android from earlier, now upgraded into a combat android with a human disguise.

The setting seems to be British and of the early twentieth century, but also suggests another planet or a future which has attempted to re-establish a former social structure. When the gynoid takes on a personality of her own, far beyond what the man had programmed, he smashes her in a fit of panic, and leaves his secret laboratory for what he believes is the last time. Twenty years later, the man has a vision of his gynoid appearing before him, but then blowing up before he can take her hand. He returns to his shed to find the gynoid still sitting smashed in a corner, just as she had been left years earlier. Another twenty years elapse, and the gynoid appears again before the man. This time, he takes her hand and walks into the distance with her, before vanishing in front of his shocked wife.\n\nLittle of the dialogue is actually spoken on-screen; all but a few lines are given in voice-over, or with the speaker's mouth obscured.\n\n;Staff\n:*Director / Scenario / Character Designer: [[Yasuomi Umetsu]]<ref name=\"alamo\"/>\n:*Animation Production Assistance: Shinsuke Terasawa, [[Hideki Nimura]]\n:*Backgrounds: Hikaru Yamakawa\n:*Sound Effects: Kenji Mori\n\n;Main cast\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Streamline Pictures producer [[Carl Macek]] licensed the OVA and released it in theaters and on video in North America in the late 1980s.\n\nA limited-edition Region 2 DVD of ''Robot Carnival'' was released in Japan through Beam Entertainment in November 2000. A Region 1 DVD of ''Robot Carnival'' was released in the United States by [[Discotek Media]] in 2015 and a Blu-ray was released in 2018.\n\n===Streamline Pictures English dub===\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2008}}\n\nThe script for the English-dubbed version of \"A Tale of Two Robots\" is slightly different from the original Japanese version and even adds a few lines that are not present in the original version. In addition, a passing reference to Japan's [[Convention of Kanagawa|1854 opening to foreign trade]] is removed and the foreign antagonist's English dialogue is re-recorded.\n\nSome versions of the English-dub of the release by [[Streamline Pictures]] shuffled the order of the segments and modified the \"Ending\" segment by removing the still images of the \"Robot Carnival,\" placing the two animated segments next to each other, and placing all of the credits at the very end of the OVA. The still images of the \"Robot Carnival\" were most likely removed due to Streamline's practice of removing all onscreen [[kanji]] from their anime releases in order to \"Americanize\" them. Carl Macek stated with certainty that the reason for the \"shuffling of segments\" was due to considerations regarding the theatrical exploitation of the OVA.\n\nThe various segments were received separately and then subsequently assembled to fill out 2000&nbsp;ft reels. In order to keep the actual distribution of the theatrical release in a manageable state, the segments were arranged to minimize reel changes \u2013 otherwise, it would have required additional reels (and therefore, additional reel changes) to keep the product in its original order and would have added to the cost of the distribution. The decision was mutually agreed upon between Streamline and APPP regarding the credit sequence and the use of still images \u2013 the original production company did not have the proper neutral closing credits required for international distribution available; therefore, it was mutually decided to create this new closing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/anncast/2010-01-14|title=ANNCast - Macek Training}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Anime and manga|Speculative fiction}}\n* [[List of package films]]\n* ''[[Neo Tokyo (film)|Neo Tokyo]]'' \u2013 an Otomo anthology film from 1987.\n* ''[[Memories (1995 film)|Memories]]'' \u2013 an Otomo anthology film from 1995. \n* ''[[Genius Party]]'' \u2013 anthology films from 2007 and 2008.\n* ''[[Short Peace]]'' \u2013 an Otomo anthology film from 2013.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id= 0093871|name= Robot Carnival}}\n*{{anime News Network|anime|828|Robot Carnival}}\n*[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/columns/buried-treasure.php?id=1 ''Anime News Network'''s \"Buried Treasure\" article on ''Robot Carnival'']\n\n{{A.P.P.P.}}\n{{Katsuhiro Otomo}}\n{{Takashi Nakamura}}\n{{K\u014dji Morimoto}}\n{{Hiroyuki Kitakubo}}\n\n[[Category:1987 anime OVAs]]\n[[Category:Alien invasions in films]]\n[[Category:Anime with original screenplays]]\n[[Category:Circus films]]\n[[Category:Discotek Media]]\n[[Category:Films directed by K\u014dji Morimoto]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 19th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in amusement parks]]\n[[Category:Films set in deserts]]\n[[Category:Films set in Japan]]\n[[Category:Films set in Tokyo]]\n[[Category:Films set in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Fiction about immortality]]\n[[Category:Japanese anthology films]]\n[[Category:Mad scientist films]]\n[[Category:Mecha anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Animated anthology films]]\n[[Category:Robot films]]"}]}}}}
