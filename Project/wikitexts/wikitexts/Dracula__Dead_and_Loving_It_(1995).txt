It is a [[parody|spoof]] of [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel ''[[Dracula]]'' and of some of the story's well-known adaptations.\n\nBrooks co-authored the screenplay with Steve Haberman and [[Rudy De Luca]]. He also appears as Dr. [[Abraham Van Helsing|Van Helsing]]. The film's other stars include [[Steven Weber]], [[Amy Yasbeck]], [[Peter MacNicol]], [[Harvey Korman]], and [[Anne Bancroft]].\n\nThe film follows the classic ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' (1931), starring [[Bela Lugosi]], in its deviations from the novel. Its visual style and production values are reminiscent of the [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Horror]] films. It spoofs, among other films, ''[[The Fearless Vampire Killers]]'' (1967) and ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (1992).\n\nAs being a critical and commercial failure, it is currently the latest film directed by Mel Brooks.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1893, Solicitor Thomas Renfield travels from London to \"Castle Dracula\" in Transylvania to finalize Dracula's purchase of Carfax Abbey in England.\n\nRenfield meets Dracula; who unknown to Renfield, is a vampire. Dracula casts a hypnotic spell on Renfield; making him his slave. They soon embark for England. During the voyage, Dracula kills the ship's crew. When the ship arrives and Renfield is discovered alone on the ship, he is confined to a lunatic asylum.\n\nMeanwhile, Dracula visits an opera house, where he introduces himself to his new neighbors; Doctor Seward, the asylum's administrator and head psychiatrist, Seward's daughter, Mina and her fiance, Jonathan Harker and family friend, Lucy Westenra. Dracula flirts with Lucy and later that night, enters her bedroom and drinks her blood.\n\nMina discovers Lucy still in bed late in the morning, looking strangely pale. Seward, puzzled by the odd puncture marks on her throat, calls in Professor Abraham Van Helsing. Van Helsing informs the skeptical Dr. Seward that Lucy has been attacked by a vampire. Seward and Harker allow garlic to be placed in Lucy's bedroom to repel the vampire, however Seward remains skeptical. After a failed attempt by Renfield to remove the garlic, Dracula uses mind control to get Lucy out of her room and kills her.\n\nVan Helsing meets Dracula and begins to suspect him of being a vampire after the two argue in Moldavian, each attempting to have the last word. Lucy, now a vampire herself, rises from her crypt, drains the blood from her guard, and tries to attack and seduce Harker before he stakes her.\n\nDracula preys on Mina, wanting her to be his undead bride. Dracula spirits Mina away to Carfax Abbey, where they dance, and he drinks her blood. The following morning, Mina tries to seduce Harker. Dr. Seward assumes Jonathan to be seducing Mina and orders him to leave. Van Helsing notices a scarf around Mina's neck and removes it, revealing two puncture marks. Though she lies about how she got them, Van Helsing confirms she has been attacked by a vampire by placing a cross on her hand, which burns a mark into it.\n\nVan Helsing devises a plan to reveal the vampire's secret identity. Both Dracula and Renfield are invited to a ball, where Van Helsing has placed a huge mirror, covered with a curtain, on one of the walls. While Dracula and Mina perform a dance routine, the curtain over the mirror is dropped, revealing that Dracula has no reflection. Dracula grabs Mina and escapes out of a window.\n\nVan Helsing deduces that Renfield is Dracula's slave, and thus might know where he has taken his coffin after a search of Carfax turns up empty. Dracula locks himself in an abandoned church to finish making Mina his bride. His pursuers break down the door, and fighting ensues. Van Helsing, noticing sunlight creeping into the room, opens the blinds. As his body begins to burn, Dracula then attempts to flee, but is inadvertently killed by Renfield.\n\nWith Dracula dead, Renfield falls into despair with no master to serve and scrapes Dracula's ashes into the coffin. Seward tells him \"you are free, now\" and Renfield seems relieved. Dr. Seward calls for Renfield to follow him out of the church, and he follows, responding \"yes, master\". Van Helsing opens Dracula's coffin and yells in Moldavian to ensure that he has the final word between himself and the count. After the end credits roll, Dracula responds in Moldavian, giving him the true final word.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Leslie Nielsen]] as [[Count Dracula]]\n*[[Mel Brooks]] as [[Abraham Van Helsing|Professor Van Helsing]]\n*[[Peter MacNicol]] as [[Renfield|Thomas Renfield]]\n*[[Steven Weber]] as [[Jonathan Harker]]\n*[[Amy Yasbeck]] as [[Mina Harker|Mina Seward]]\n*[[Lysette Anthony]] as [[Lucy Westenra]]\n*[[Harvey Korman]] as [[John Seward|Dr. Seward]]\n*[[Anne Bancroft]] as Madame Ouspenskaya (Gypsy Woman)\n*[[Ezio Greggio]] as the coachman\n*[[Megan Cavanagh]] as Essie\n*[[Chuck McCann]] as Innkeeper\n*[[Mark Blankfield]] as Martin\n*[[Clive Revill]] as Sykes\n*[[Gregg Binkley]] as Woodbridge\n*[[Rudy De Luca]] as Guard\n*[[Avery Schreiber]] as Male Peasant on Coach\n*Cherie Franklin as Female Peasant on Coach\n*[[David DeLuise]] as a student in Van Helsing's demonstration\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] began in May 1995 and wrapped in September 1995.

It's a toothless parody that misses more often than it hits. ... Given the comic turn his career has taken since the early '80s, it's hard to believe that Leslie Nielsen was once a serious actor. These days, thanks to the Zucker brothers ... he has become an accomplished satirical performer. His sense of timing is impeccable, and this asset has made him a sought-after commodity for a wide variety of spoofs. Here, Nielsen takes on the title role, but his presence can't resurrect this stillborn lampoon. Unless you're a die hard Mel Brooks fan, there's no compelling reason to sit through ''Dracula: Dead and Loving It''. The sporadic humor promises some laughs, but the ninety minutes will go by slowly.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/d/drac_dead.html |title=Dead and Loving It - A Film Review by James Berardinelli |publisher=reelviews.net |access-date=2012-02-11}}</ref>\n\nJoe Leydon of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote: \"Leslie Nielsen toplines to agreeable effect as Count Dracula, depicted here as a dead-serious but frequently flustered fellow who's prone to slipping on bat droppings in his baroque castle. ... Trouble is, while ''Dead and Loving It'' earns a fair share of grins and giggles, it never really cuts loose and goes for the belly laughs. Compared with the recent glut of dumb, dumber and dumbest comedies, Brooks's pic seems positively understated. Indeed, there isn't much here that would have seemed out of place (or too tasteless) in comedy sketches for TV variety shows of the 1950s. ... As a result, unfortunately, ''Dead and Loving It'' is so mild, it comes perilously close to blandness. ... The only real sparks are set off by MacNicol as Renfield, the solicitor who develops a taste for flies and spiders after being bitten by Dracula.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117910573?refcatid=31 |title=Dracula: Dead and Loving It - Review by Joe Leydon |publisher=variety.com |date= 1995-12-17|access-date=2012-02-11}}</ref>\n\nBruce G. Hallenbeck defended the film in his book ''Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914-2008'', saying it \"ranks with Polanski's ''[[The Fearless Vampire Killers]]'' as one of the greatest vampire comedies ever made.\" He praised the dry wit, strong performances of all the cast members, and the way the film acts as an affectionate homage to the classic vampire films rather than purely a spoof. He attributed the film's negative reception to its being so targeted towards hardcore enthusiasts of vampire films that general audiences would not pick up on most of the jokes, and to the inevitable comparisons to Brooks's seminal ''Young Frankenstein''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914-2008 |url=https://archive.org/details/comedyhorrorfilm00hall|url-access=limited |last=Hallenbeck |first=Bruce G.|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2009 |isbn=9780786453788|pages=183\u2013186}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film debuted at #10.<ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office : 'Exhale' Blows Down the Competition|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1995-12-27|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1995-12-27/entertainment/ca-18149_1_weekend-gross|access-date=2012-06-03|first=Elaine|last=Dutka}}</ref> By the end of its run, ''Dracula'' grossed $10,772,144.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{mojo title|draculadeadandlovingit|Dracula: Dead and Loving It}} Retrieved October 14, 2013</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Speculative fiction/Horror|Film|Comedy}}\n* [[Vampire film]]\n* ''[[Vampire in Brooklyn]]''\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* [https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/dracula-dead-and-loving-it Official website]\n* {{IMDb title|0112896|Dracula: Dead and Loving It}}\n* {{mojo title|draculadeadandlovingit|Dracula: Dead and Loving It}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|dracula_dead_and_loving_it|Dracula: Dead and Loving It}}\n\n{{Mel Brooks}}\n{{Dracula}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dracula Dead And Loving It}}\n[[Category:Dracula films]]\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1990s comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:American comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:American parody films]]\n[[Category:American satirical films]]\n[[Category:American vampire films]]\n[[Category:French comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:English-language French films]]\n[[Category:French parody films]]\n[[Category:French vampire films]]\n[[Category:1990s German-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mel Brooks]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Mel Brooks]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Mel Brooks]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1893]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:Films set in Transylvania]]\n[[Category:Films set in castles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Brooksfilms films]]\n[[Category:Castle Rock Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:PolyGram Filmed Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Hummie Mann]]\n[[Category:Vampire comedy films]]\n[[Category:American slapstick comedy films]]\n[[Category:Parodies of horror]]\n[[Category:Films about hypnosis]]\n[[Category:French satirical films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Rudy De Luca]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n[[Category:1990s French films]]"}]}}}}
