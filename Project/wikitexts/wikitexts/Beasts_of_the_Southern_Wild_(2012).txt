After playing at [[film festival]]s, its [[limited theatrical release]] began in New York and Los Angeles on June 27, 2012, before expanding to additional markets.\n\n''Beasts of the Southern Wild'' was met with commercial success and acclaim from critics, with praise going to the cinematography and Wallis's performance. The film was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]] in [[85th Academy Awards|2013]]: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (Wallis).

Although it lies beyond the [[levee]] system that helps protect the land to the north from rising sea levels, Wink thinks it is the most beautiful place in the world and looks down on the way people live on the other side of the levee.\n\nIn a rustic community schoolhouse, Miss Bathsheba teaches the children of the Bathtub about prehistoric creatures called [[aurochs]] that terrorized [[cavemen]] and ate their children. She says the cavemen did not bemoan their fate, however, and the students should remember this lesson and learn how to survive, since the fabric of the universe will soon come \"unraveled\", causing the ice caps to melt and the Bathtub to end up underwater.\n\nAt home, Hushpuppy finds Wink has gone missing, so she fends for herself. When he returns, he is wearing a hospital gown and bracelet. They argue, and he tells Hushpuppy to leave him alone. She returns to her house, which is a separate building from the one in which Wink resides, and finds her food burning on the stove. She turns up the heat, which sets her house on fire and draws Wink's attention. A chase ensues between the two, and she ends up getting slapped by Wink. When she retaliates by punching him in the chest, he collapses. At the same moment, there is a rumble of thunder. Hushpuppy thinks she has thrown off the balance of the Universe by striking her father and runs to get help. Miss Bathsheba gives her some [[herbal medicine]], but when Hushpuppy gets back home Wink is nowhere to be found.\n\nMeanwhile, [[ice calving]] releases some aurochs that have been frozen in polar ice into the ocean. Throughout the rest of the film, they are seen to reach land, break out of the ice that encases them, and make their way toward the Bathtub.\n\nAs the weather worsens and Hushpuppy watches many residents of the Bathtub fleeing the impending flood, she sees Wink staggering along the side of the road. He finds some friends and encourages them to ride out the storm before taking Hushpuppy home to do the same. The Bathtub floods overnight, and the next day Wink and Hushpuppy tour the devastation and reconnect with the handful of their neighbors who have also stayed behind.\n\nThe remaining Bathtub residents build floating homes and make plans to rebuild their community. Some of them think the flooding is only temporary, but Miss Bathsheba thinks it is permanent and says the amount of time before they will have to move is limited. As time passes, it seems likely that she is right, so Wink hatches a plan to drain the water away by blowing a hole in the [[levee]] with an [[alligator gar]] carcass stuffed with explosives. The water recedes, but then authorities arrive to enforce a mandatory evacuation of the Bathtub. They remove the remaining residents to an emergency shelter and Wink undergoes an operation for his ailment against his wishes. It has come too late to restore his health, however, and he tries to send Hushpuppy to be raised by someone else, but she refuses to go. At the first opportunity, the evacuees escape back to their homes.\n\nWhile Wink lies dying, Hushpuppy and a few of her friends attempt to swim to a flashing light across the water that she feels might lead her to her absent mother. They are picked up by a boat that takes them to a floating bar known as the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]]. Hushpuppy discovers that the cook is her mother, though the woman doesn't recognize her. The cook says Hushpuppy can stay with her if she wants, but Hushpuppy says she needs to go home.\n\nHushpuppy gets back to the Bathtub just as the aurochs are also arriving. Her friends run away, but she calmly stands her ground and confronts the aurochs. She convinces them to leave and goes to be with Wink. They say their last goodbyes and she and the remaining residents of the Bathtub give him the funeral he asked for.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis]] as Hushpuppy\n* [[Dwight Henry (actor)|Dwight Henry]] as Wink, Hushpuppy's father\n* Levy Easterly as Jean Battiste, a resident of the Bathtub\n* Lowell Landes as Walrus, a resident of the Bathtub\n* Pamela Harper as Little Jo, a resident of the Bathtub\n* Gina Montana as Miss Bathsheba, Hushpuppy's teacher\n* Amber Henry as LZA, a friend of Hushpuppy\n* Jonshel Alexander as Joy Strong, a friend of Hushpuppy\n* Nicholas Clark as Boy with bell (\"Sticks\")\n* Henry D.
