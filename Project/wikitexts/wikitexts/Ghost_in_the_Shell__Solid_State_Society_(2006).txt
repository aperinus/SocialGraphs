It was produced by [[Production I.G]] and directed by [[Kenji Kamiyama]].\n\nThe film is set in 2034, two years after the events of ''[[Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG|2nd GIG]]''. Togusa is now the team leader for [[Public Security Section 9]], which has increased considerably in size. Section 9 deals with a series of complicated incidents, including the assassination of Ka Rum, a former dictator of the Siak Republic, which leads to a terrorist plot using children as vectors for a cybernetic virus. Investigations reveal that a hacker nicknamed \"The Puppeteer\" is behind the entire series of events.\n\nThe film, which had a [[production budget]] of 360 million yen, debuted in Japan on [[SKY PerfecTV!]] on September 1, 2006, and it was released in North America in 2007. A stereoscopic 3D version of the film was released in 2011. The film received generally positive reviews, but was criticized for being dialogue-heavy and lacking in action.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2034, two years after the events of ''[[Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG|2nd GIG]]'', [[Public Security Section 9]] is investigating a string of mysterious suicides by refugees from the Siak Republic. Chief Aramaki conducts a raid to arrest the refugee dictator only to find him already dead. In retaliation, a Siak operative plans a terrorist attack with a micromachine virus. [[Batou]] is sent to intercept the Siak operative and encounters Kusanagi, who is conducting her own investigation. Before they can apprehend the operative, he dies while attacking them. Kusanagi takes a case of virus ampules and warns Batou to stay away from the Solid State Society before leaving.\n\nSection 9 operatives develop a theory that a hacker known as the Puppeteer or \u5080\u5121\u5efb (''Kugutsumawashi'', literally 'Puppet Spinner', contrasted with the original film Puppet Master who was \u4eba\u5f62\u4f7f\u3044 ''Ningy\u014d-zukai'', literally 'Doll Handler') is responsible for Siak agents' forced suicides and Togusa discovers sixteen kidnapped children who were intended carriers of the virus. All the children are listed as the children of Noble Rot Senior Citizens and Section 9 begins to suspect a larger conspiracy when they are part of a larger body of 20,000 children.\n\nSoon afterwards, the Puppeteer causes the disappearance of the sixteen children and Batou reveals to Togusa that he believes Kusanagi to be the Puppeteer. Section 9 next intercepts a Siak sniper that is targeting the supposed mastermind of Ka Rum's assassination. After his capture it is revealed the informant and the target are one and the same. The sniper says that the Puppeteer is a mechanism in the Solid State and cannot be killed.\n\nTogusa tracks down one of the missing children, now assigned to an elderly man in the Noble Rot program. As Togusa tries to take the child, the man awakens and demands the child be left with him as he had named the child as his sole heir. He would rather give his assets to a child off the street and to protect them from abuse than have his assets turned over to the government upon his death. The man immediately dies after warning Togusa not to interfere with the will of the Solid State.\n\nLater, Togusa receives a call from the Puppeteer who hacks his brain and forces him to drive to a cyberbrain implant hospital with his daughter. The Puppeteer and Togusa converse, and Togusa is given the option to lose his daughter to the Solid State or commit suicide. He chooses suicide but is saved by Kusanagi who then identifies the Puppeteer as a [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizome]] formed by the collective consciousness of the Noble Rot Senior Citizens located in a welfare center.\n\nKusanagi temporarily rejoins Section 9 and confirms that Ito Munei, an influential politician, was behind the assassination of General Ka Rum. She also confirms that Munei and other politicians use it as a front for a brainwashing facility to create an elite group of pure-blooded Japanese to take control of the country in the next generation and lead it into Munei's vision of a new [[Golden Age]]. The Solid State decided to eliminate Munei for interfering in its plans, but Munei was ignorant of the origin of the abduction infrastructure.\n\nA designer named Tateaki Koshiki steps forward, claiming he developed the Solid State system before committing suicide. Kusanagi dives into his cyberbrain and into Koshiki's trap, allowing him to hack her cyberbrain. The Puppeteer reveals that he was spread across several [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|egos]] until a [[collective consciousness]] emerged and developed into a Solid State, allowing him to move into the society beyond as the [[vanishing mediator]]. Later, Batou tells a recovering Kusanagi that the real Tateaki Koshiki used a prosthetic body and built the Solid State after he was hired by Munei.\n\nKusanagi does not reveal that the Puppeteer was a fragment of herself, but Batou already knew from being linked to her during the dive. Batou concludes that the ultimate identity of the Puppeteer will remain unknown and that incident will be written off as a scandal. Kusanagi implies that she will permanently rejoin Section 9 after years of wandering the net on her own.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Character !!
