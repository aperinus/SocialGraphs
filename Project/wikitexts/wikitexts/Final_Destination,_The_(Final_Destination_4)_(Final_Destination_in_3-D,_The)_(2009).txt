Ellis]]. It is the fourth installment in the [[Final Destination|''Final Destination'' film series]] and the second [[standalone sequel]] after ''[[Final Destination 3]]'', and stars [[Bobby Campo]], [[Shantel VanSanten]], and [[Mykelti Williamson]]. Produced by [[New Line Cinema]], the film follows a group of people after they escape a car crash during a race, with Death stalking and killing them one by one.\n\nAfter the commercial success of ''Final Destination 3'', a fourth film entered in development and was planned to be in 3\u2013D, with Bress writing the script. The script impressed producer [[Craig Perry]] and New Line Cinema enough to green-light a fourth installment. [[James Wong (filmmaker)|James Wong]] was on board to direct, but because of scheduling conflicts, he decided to drop out. Consequently, the studio executives opted for David R. Ellis to return because of his work on ''Final Destination 2'', who personally accepted because of the 3D. Filming began in March 2008 and ended late May in the same year.\n\n''The Final Destination'' was theatrically released on August 28, 2009, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and New Line Cinema. It is the first film in the series to be shot in HD 3D, and is currently the highest-grossing ''Final Destination'' film, earning $186 million worldwide. The film received generally negative reviews from critics. The fifth film in the franchise, ''[[Final Destination 5]]'', was released in August 2011.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP: FILMPLOT]], film plots should be between 400 and 700 words -->\nIn 2009, college student [[List of Final Destination characters#Nick O'Bannon|Nick O'Bannon]] watches an [[Auto racing|auto race]] with his girlfriend [[List of Final Destination characters#Lori Milligan|Lori Milligan]] and their friends [[List of Final Destination characters#Hunt Wynorski|Hunt Wynorski]] and [[List of Final Destination characters#Janet Cunningham|Janet Cunningham]] at the McKinley Speedway for their semester break. Nick suffers a premonition of an accident from the racetrack that sends debris into the [[grandstand]], causing its front stretch to collapse. When Nick panics, a scuffle breaks out and several people leave the stadium, including Lori, Hunt, Janet, racist tow truck driver [[List of Final Destination characters#Carter Daniels|Carter Daniels]], mother [[List of Final Destination characters#Samantha Lane|Samantha Lane]], mechanic [[List of Final Destination characters#Andy Kewzer|Andy Kewzer]], his girlfriend [[List of Final Destination characters#Nadia Monroy|Nadia Monroy]], and security guard [[List of Final Destination characters#George Lanter|George Lanter]]. As Nadia berates the group, a stray tire flies out of the stadium and decapitates her.\n\nOn one of the nights following the accident, Carter drives to George's house to burn a cross on his lawn, blaming the guard for preventing him from saving his wife [[List of Final Destination characters#Cynthia Daniels|Cynthia]] at the speedway, but his tow truck ignites him and causes him to be dragged down the street before it explodes. The next day, Samantha is leaving a beauty salon when a rock propelled by a lawnmower is shot through her eye, killing her. After learning of their deaths and [[Final Destination|similar disasters parallel to the speedway's]], Nick becomes convinced that [[Death (personification)|Death]] is after them. He and Lori return to the speedway with George's help to find the next survivor, Andy, but the next day, Andy is killed at the mechanic shop when a [[Carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide tank]] launches him through a metal grid fence. After Nick predicts that Hunt and Janet's deaths will involve water, George and Lori find the latter, who is trapped in a malfunctioning car wash, and narrowly manage to rescue her. However, Nick arrives too late to save Hunt, who accidentally activated a [[country club]]'s pool drainage system and ended up being disemboweled by the drain pipe.\n\nFour days later, Nick realizes from a news report that another spectator, [[List of Final Destination characters#Jonathan Groves|Jonathan Groves]], was rescued after the speedway's collapse; Jonathan had died in the premonition after being asked to move seats, but this never ended up happening due to Nick intervening. Nick and George track Jonathan down at a hospital where he was recovering from the accident, only to witness him being crushed by an overflowing bathtub falling through the ceiling. As they leave, Nick receives a premonition of a multitude of explosions at the mall that leads to Janet and Lori's deaths, but fails to save George, who is run over by a speeding ambulance before Nick could warn him. Nick runs back to the mall to try and stop the explosion before it occurs. Despite being pinned to a wall by a nail gun, he manages to stop a fire before it spreads to several combustible barrels, saving everyone.\n\nTwo weeks later, Nick, Lori, and Janet go to a caf\u00e9 to celebrate. During their conversation however, Nick starts to see more omens and alludes to the theory that the [[chain of events]] since the speedway disaster was meant to lead them to where they needed to be for Death to strike. Just as he realizes this, a loose scaffold outside collapses on the road, causing a [[Combination bus|truck]] to swerve and crash into the caf\u00e9, killing him, Lori, and Janet.\n\n==Cast==\n{{for|more details on the characters|List of Final Destination characters}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bobby Campo]] as Nick O'Bannon \n* [[Shantel VanSanten]] as Lori Milligan \n* [[Nick Zano]] as Hunt Wynorski \n* [[Haley Webb]] as Janet Cunningham\n* [[Mykelti Williamson]] as George Lanter \n* [[Krista Allen]] as Samantha Lane \n* [[Andrew Fiscella]] as Andy Kewzer \n* [[Justin Welborn]] as Carter Daniels \n* [[Stephanie Honor\u00e9]] as Nadia Monroy \n* [[Lara Grice]] as Cynthia Daniels \n* Jackson Walker as Jonathan Groves\n* Phil Austin as Edward Lane\n* William Aguillard as Daniel Lane\n* Brendan Aguillard as Ryan Lane\n* [[Tina Parker]] as Cheyenne\n* Cecile Monteyne as Dee Dee\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nAfter the success of ''[[Final Destination 3]]'', which was initially planned to be in [[3D film|3D]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Miska|first=Brad|title=SET VISIT PART I: FINAL DESTINATION 4: 3-D Explodes in Our Face!|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEjm7pklbAwCml|work=[[Bloody-Disgusting]]|date=November 20, 2007|access-date=May 3, 2009}}</ref> [[Eric Bress]] wrote a script, which impressed producer Craig Perry and [[Warner Bros.]] enough to green-light a fourth installment.
