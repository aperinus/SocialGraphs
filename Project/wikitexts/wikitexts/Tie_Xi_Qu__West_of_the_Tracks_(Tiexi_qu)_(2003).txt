Over nine hours long, the film consists of three parts: \"Rust,\" \"Remnants\" and \"Rails.\"\n\n''Tie Xi Qu'' was filmed over the course of two years between 1999 and 2001<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/18/movies/18trac.html|title=West of the Tracks|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=CATSOULIS, Jeannette|accessdate=2007-11-24|date=2007-04-18}}</ref> and details the slow decline of [[Shenyang]]'s industrial [[Tiexi District, Shenyang|Tiexi district]], an area that was once a vibrant example of China's socialist economy. With the rise of the free market and the move towards other industries, however, the factories of Tiexi have all begun to be closed down and with them much of the district's worker-based infrastructure and social constructs.\n\nAlthough ''Tie Xi Qu: West of the Tracks'' is rarely seen due to its length, many critics have named it one of the best and most important films of the 2000s.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== \"Rust\" ===\nThe first portion, \"Rust,\" follows a group of factory workers in three state-run factories: a smelting plant, an electric cable factory and a sheet metal factory. Workers of all three are hindered by sub-standard equipment, hazardous waste, and a lack of safety precautions. Perhaps even worse, the declining need for heavy industry results in a constant shortage of raw materials, leaving the workers idle and concerned for their future. In Chinese, this section is called \u5de5\u5ee0 (''g\u014dngch\u01ceng''), meaning \"factory\".\n\n=== \"Remnants\" ===\nThe second part, \"Remnants\" follows the families of many of the workers in an old state-run housing block, \"Rainbow Row.\" In particular, Wang focuses on the teenage children who concern themselves with their own lives but must also cope with their inevitable displacement as Tie Xi's factories continue to close down. In Chinese, this section is called \u8273\u7c89\u8857 (''Y\u00e0nf\u011bn Ji\u0113''), meaning \"Yanfen Street.\"\n\n=== \"Rails\" ===\nThe third part, \"Rails\" narrows its focus to a single father and son who scavenge the rail yards in order to sell raw parts to the factories. With the factories closing however, their future suddenly becomes uncertain. In Chinese, this section is called \u94c1\u8def (''ti\u011bl\u00f9''), meaning \"railway.\"\n\n== Reception ==\nAccording to ''They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?'', a website which aggregates critics' reviews, ''Tie Xi Qu: West of the Tracks'' is the 27th most acclaimed film of the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theyshootpictures.com/21stcentury_films50-1.htm |title=The 21st Century's Most Acclaimed Films (50-1) |publisher=They Shoot Pictures, Don't They |accessdate=February 24, 2020}}</ref> In a 2012 poll by the [[British Film Institute]], eight critics named it one of the 10 greatest films ever made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/film/4ce2b894cfdd1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820043748/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/film/4ce2b894cfdd1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 20, 2012 |title=''West of the Tracks'' (2002) |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=September 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of longest films by running time]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0389448|title=Tie Xi Qu}}\n*{{Amg movie|284366|Tie Xi Qu: West of the Tracks}}\n*[http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc50.2008/WestofTracks/index.html Jumpcut Discussion]\n*Ramos-Martinez, Manuel (2015), \"[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09528822.2015.1036579 The Oxidation of Documentary - The Politics of Rust in Wang Bing's ''Tie Xi Qu:West of the Tracks'']\", at ''Third Text''\n\n[[Category:Chinese documentary films]]\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:2000s Mandarin-language films]]\n[[Category:2002 documentary films]]\n[[Category:Chinese avant-garde and experimental films]]\n[[Category:Shenyang]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Wang Bing]]\n[[Category:2000s Chinese films]]\n\n\n{{2000s-China-film-stub}}\n{{2000s-documentary-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
