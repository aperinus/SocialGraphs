The film's plot revolves around a woman who believes that she lost her son in a plane crash 14 months earlier, only to wake up one morning and be told that she never had a son. All of her memories are intact, but with no physical evidence that contradicts the claims of her husband and her psychiatrist, and she sets out in search for solid evidence of her son's existence.\n\n''The Forgotten'' was produced by [[Revolution Studios]] for [[Columbia Pictures]] and was released in the United States and Canada on September 24, 2004.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nTelly Paretta grieves the loss of her son Sam, who died 14 months prior in a plane crash. She holds regular vigils in his undisturbed bedroom, visits his grave, and meets with a support group for parents who lost their children to accidents, though her husband, Jim wants to move on. \n\nReturning from work one afternoon, Telly finds Sam's room completely empty of his things and redecorated with new furniture. Furious, she confronts Jim for trying to forget, but her husband shocks her with a counter accusation: That she is, in actuality, delusional and that they have never had a son.\n\nHurt, Telly begins reaching out to acquaintances to confirm Sam's existence; however, her friend Eliot doesn't appear to believe in Sam's existence despite her closeness to him. Looking for concrete evidence, she visits Dr. Munce, her OB/GYN; he confirms that she was pregnant, but that she miscarried and \"Sam\" is her delusional fantasy about how her life would have been different if he had lived. He recommends that she be sent to a hospital, but she runs away.\n\nFleeing and still adamant that Sam is real, she locates Ash, a member of the support group, whose daughter Lauren was Sam's friend and died in the same crash. However, he also dismisses her and claims he never had a daughter, and calls the police. Shaken by Telly's certainty, he explores his house, discovering Lauren's old room covered up by new paint and wallpaper; in a rush, he remembers his daughter and losing her. \n\nChasing after Telly, he rescues her from the police and they go into hiding, pursued by [[National Security Agency|NSA]] agents. On the run, they speculate about who would have the power, resources, and motive to want to make them forget about their children.\n\nTelly and Ash capture and threaten a pursuing agent, who reluctantly reveals that he and other agents are merely helping \u2033them\u2033 in order to protect humankind. Without warning, the roof of the house blows off and the agent, along with the roof, is sucked into the sky\u2014presumably taken by \"them\"\u2014and Telly and Ash flee. \n\nEventually, Telly visits Dr. Munce again and he reveals that the disappearances are the work of \"them\", and that the government monitors their trials, all too aware that they have no power to stop \"them\" from doing whatever they want.\n\nMunce takes Telly to an airport and the dilapidated hangar of Quest Airlines, where he introduces her to an agent of \"them\". He tells the agent that it's over and to stop the experiment, because it will only cause more harm. But the agent replies that it's not over. He reveals to Telly that she has been a part of an experiment to test whether the bonds between mother and child can be diminished. In her case, her memories could not be fully erased. \n\nTelly refuses to deny her son's existence. The agent mentions that if he fails to erase her memory then he will look like a failure. The agent then subdues her and convinces her to think of the first memory she had of Sam. Telly thinks of the day he was born in the hospital, which allows the agent to successfully erase Sam's memory from existence. \n\nAs the agent is walking away thinking he has succeeded, Telly's motherly bond kicks in deeper to the time she was pregnant with Sam, triggering her memory that she indeed had life in her at one time. All of her memories of Sam return. Before the agent can comprehend what's happening, part of the hangar roof is suddenly blown off, and he's yanked into the sky himself for his failure to erase her memory. This ends the experiment.\n\nTelly finds herself living a normal life, with memories of everything that has happened. She reunites with Sam at a park. Also at the park is Ash, watching over his daughter. Like Sam, he has no memory of what has happened. Telly reintroduces herself, and the two sit and watch the kids play in the playground.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n<!-- All names as per film's end credits, as per [[WP:FILMCAST]] -->\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Telly Paretta\n* [[Dominic West]] as Ash\n* Christopher Kovaleski as Sam Paretta\n** Matthew Pleszewicz as Sam at age 5\n* [[Jessica Hecht]] as Eliot\n* [[Gary Sinise]] as Dr. Jack Munce\n* [[Alfre Woodard]] as Anne Pope\n* [[Anthony Edwards (actor)|Anthony Edwards]] as Jim Paretta\n* Kathryn Faughnan as Lauren\n* [[Linus Roache]] as A Friendly Man<!-- As per film's end credits -->\n* [[Lee Tergesen]] as Al Petalis\n* [[Felix Solis]] as Brasher\n* [[Robert Wisdom]] as Carl Dayton\n* [[Tim Kang]] as Agent Alec Wong\n* [[Susan Misner]] as Agent Lisa Franks\n* J.
