The film is based on [[Stephen King]]'s 1977 [[The Shining (novel)|novel of the same name]] and stars [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Shelley Duvall]], [[Scatman Crothers]], and [[Danny Lloyd]]. The film's central character is [[Jack Torrance]] (Nicholson), an aspiring writer and recovering alcoholic who accepts a position as the off-season caretaker of the isolated historic Overlook Hotel in the Colorado Rockies, with his wife, [[Wendy Torrance]] (Duvall), and young son, [[Danny Torrance]] (Lloyd). Danny is gifted with psychic abilities named \"shining\". After a winter storm leaves the Torrances snowbound, Jack's sanity deteriorates due to the influence of the supernatural forces that inhabit the hotel.\n\nProduction took place almost exclusively at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|EMI Elstree Studios]], with sets based on real locations. Kubrick often worked with a small crew, which allowed him to do many takes, sometimes to the exhaustion of the actors and staff. The new [[Steadicam]] mount was used to shoot several scenes, giving the film an innovative and immersive look and feel. There has been much speculation about the meanings and actions in the film because of inconsistencies, ambiguities, symbolism, and differences from the book.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on May 23, 1980, and in the United Kingdom on October 2 by [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Bros.]] There were several versions for theatrical releases, each of which was cut shorter than the preceding cut; about 27 minutes was cut in total. Reactions to the film at the time of its release were mixed; Stephen King criticized the film due to its deviations from the novel. The film received two nominations at the [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzies]]\u2014one for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]] (for Duvall)\u2014the latter of which was later rescinded due to Kubrick's treatment of Duvall on set. Critical response to the film has since become more favorable.\n\nIn 2012, ''The Shining'' was ranked the 75th greatest film of all time in the ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' directors' poll.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/directors|title=Directors' top 100|work=BFI|access-date=31 March 2022|archive-date=February 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225010816/https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/directors|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Jonathan Jr. |last=Landrum |url=https://apnews.com/64bed08db5f44f69a34bd2e9678f5d40 |title='Jurassic Park,' 'Shining' added to National Film Registry |website=[[Associated Press]] |date=December 12, 2018 |access-date=December 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181212090412/https://apnews.com/64bed08db5f44f69a34bd2e9678f5d40|archive-date=December 12, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Thirty-nine years after the original film, a sequel, ''[[Doctor Sleep (2019 film)|Doctor Sleep]]'', was released on November 8, 2019.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plots should be between 400 and 700 words.

After his arrival, manager Stuart Ullman advises Torrance that a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, killed his family and himself in the hotel.\n\nIn [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], Jack's son, [[Danny Torrance|Danny]], has a [[wikt:premonition|premonition]] and seizure. Jack's wife, [[Wendy Torrance|Wendy]], tells the doctor about a past incident when Jack dislocated Danny's shoulder during a drunken rage. The incident convinced Jack to stop drinking alcohol. Before leaving for the seasonal break, head chef [[Dick Hallorann (The Shining)|Dick Hallorann]] informs Danny of a [[telepathy|telepathic ability]] the two share, which he calls \"shining\". Hallorann tells Danny the hotel also has a \"shine\" due to residues from unpleasant past events, and warns him to avoid Room 237.<!-- Changed from novel's room 217. Please do not change -->\n\nDanny starts having frightening visions, including one of two twin sisters. Meanwhile, Jack's mental health deteriorates; he gets nowhere with his writing, is prone to violent outbursts, and has dreams of killing his family. Danny gets physically bruised after visiting an unlocked Room 237 out of curiosity. Jack encounters a female ghost in the room, but blames Danny for self-inflicting the bruises. Jack is enticed back to drinking by the ghostly bartender Lloyd. Ghostly figures, including Delbert Grady, then begin appearing in the Gold Room. Grady informs Jack that Danny has reached out to Hallorann using his \"talent\", and says that Jack must \"correct\" his wife and child.\n\nWendy finds Jack's manuscript with \"[[All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy]]\" written repeatedly numerous times. When Jack threatens her life, Wendy knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat and locks him in the kitchen pantry, but she and Danny cannot leave due to Jack having previously sabotaged the hotel's two-way radio and [[snowcat]]. Back in their hotel room, Danny is saying \"redrum\" multiple times and even writes the word on the bathroom door. Wendy sees the word in the mirror and realizes that the word spells out \"murder\" backwards. Jack is freed by Grady and goes after Wendy and Danny with an axe. Danny escapes outside through the bathroom window, and Wendy fights Jack off with a knife when he breaks through the door. Hallorann, having flown back to Colorado after Danny's telepathic [[SOS]], reaches the hotel in another snowcat. His arrival distracts Jack, who ambushes and murders Hallorann in the lobby, then pursues Danny into the hedge maze. Wendy runs through the hotel looking for Danny, encountering the hotel's ghosts and a vision of cascading blood similar to Danny's premonition.\n\nIn the hedge maze, Danny misleads Jack and hides behind a snowdrift while Jack follows a false trail. Danny and Wendy reunite and leave in Hallorann's snowcat, leaving Jack to freeze to death in the maze. In a photograph in the hotel hallway, Jack is pictured standing amidst a crowd of party revelers from July 4, 1921.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as [[Jack Torrance]]\n* [[Shelley Duvall]] as [[Wendy Torrance]]\n* [[Danny Lloyd]] as [[Danny Torrance|Danny \"Doc\" Torrance]]\n* [[Scatman Crothers]] as [[Dick Hallorann]]\n* [[Barry Nelson (actor)|Barry Nelson]] as Stuart Ullman\n* [[Philip Stone]] as Delbert Grady\n* [[Joe Turkel]] as Lloyd\n* [[Anne Jackson]] as Doctor\n* [[Tony Burton]] as Larry Durkin\n* Lia Beldam as Young Woman in Bath\n* Billie Gibson as Old Woman in Bath\n* [[Barry Dennen]] as Bill Watson\n* Lisa and Louise Burns as Grady Twins\n}}\n\nIn the European cut, all of the scenes involving Jackson and Burton were removed but the credits remained unchanged.

Despite its technical achievements, the film was not a box-office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow. Kubrick, disappointed with ''Barry Lyndon''{{'}}s lack of success, realized he needed to make a film that would be commercially viable as well as artistically fulfilling. Stephen King was told that Kubrick had his staff bring him stacks of horror books as he planted himself in his office to read them all: \"Kubrick's secretary heard the sound of each book hitting the wall as the director flung it into a reject pile after reading the first few pages. Finally one day the secretary noticed it had been a while since she had heard the thud of another writer's work biting the dust. She walked in to check on her boss and found Kubrick deeply engrossed in reading ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''.\"<ref>{{cite book| first= Vincent| last= LoBrutto| title=Stanley Kubrick, A Biography| publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]| location=Boston |date= 1999| isbn=978-0306809064 |page=412}}</ref>\n\nSpeaking about the theme of the film, Kubrick stated that \"there's something inherently wrong with the human personality. There's an evil side to it. One of the things that horror stories can do is to show us the archetypes of the unconscious; we can see the dark side without having to confront it directly\".<ref name=\"Duncan, Paul 2003 9\">{{cite book|title=Stanley Kubrick: The Complete Films |year=2003 |first= Paul|last=Duncan |page=9 |publisher= Taschen GmbH |location=Beverly Hills, California|isbn=978-3836527750}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[File:The Shining casting ad.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.5|Newspaper ad for the role of Danny Torrance]]\nNicholson was Kubrick's first choice for the role of Jack Torrance; other actors considered included [[Robert De Niro]] (who said the film gave him nightmares for a month),<ref>{{cite AV media |title=Interview with Robert De Niro |publisher=[[B105 FM]] |date= September 20, 2007}}</ref> [[Robin Williams]], and [[Harrison Ford]], all of whom met with Stephen King's disapproval.<ref>{{cite AV media |title=Interview with Stephen King |publisher= B105 FM |date= November 21, 2007}}</ref> Stephen King, for his part, disavowed Nicholson because he thought that, since he had shot ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', the viewer would tend to consider him an unstable individual from the beginning.

(8648670619).jpg|thumb|Page from ''The Shining'' screenplay|right]]\n''The Shining'' had a prolonged and arduous production period, often with very long workdays. Principal photography took over a year to complete, due to Kubrick's highly methodical nature. Actress Shelley Duvall did not get along with Kubrick, frequently arguing with him on set about lines in the script, her acting techniques and numerous other things. Duvall eventually became so overwhelmed by the stress of her role that she became physically ill for months. At one point, she was under so much stress that her hair began to fall out. The shooting script was being changed constantly, sometimes several times a day, adding more stress. Nicholson eventually became so frustrated with the ever-changing script that he would throw away the copies that the production team had given him to memorize, knowing that it was going to change anyway. He learned most of his lines just minutes before filming them. Nicholson was living in London with his then-girlfriend [[Anjelica Huston]] and her younger sister, Allegra, who testified to his long shooting days.<ref>Huston, Allegra. ''Love Child, a Memoir of Family Lost and Found''. Simon & Schuster (2009) p. 214</ref> Joe Turkel stated in a 2014 interview that they rehearsed the \"bar scene\" for six weeks and that the shoot day lasted from 9{{nbsp}}a.m. to 10:30{{nbsp}}p.m., with Turkel recollecting that his clothes were soaked in perspiration by the end of the day's shoot.

It essentially combines the stabilized steady footage of a regular mount with the fluidity and flexibility of a handheld camera. The inventor of the Steadicam, [[Garrett Brown]], was heavily involved with the production of ''The Shining''. Brown has described his excitement taking his first tour of the sets, which offered \"further possibilities for the Steadicam\". This tour convinced Brown to become personally involved with the production. Kubrick was not \"just talking of stunt shots and staircases\". Rather he would use the Steadicam \"as it was intended to be used&nbsp;\u2014 as a tool which can help get the lens where it's wanted in space and time without the classic limitations of the dolly and crane\". Brown used an 18&nbsp;mm Cooke lens that allowed the Steadicam to pass within an inch of walls and door frames.<ref>LoBrutto, p. 426</ref> Brown published an article in ''[[American Cinematographer]]'' about his experience,<ref>Brown, G. (1980) The Steadicam and The Shining. American Cinematographer. Reproduced at [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/ac/page2.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413131605/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/ac/page2.htm|date=April 13, 2012}} without issue date or pages given</ref> and contributed to the audio commentary on the 2007 DVD release.\n\n[[File:Ahwahnee Hotel - Great Lounge.jpg|thumb|The Overlook Hotel's Colorado Lounge set was modeled in large part on the [[Ahwahnee Hotel]]'s Great Lounge.]]\nKubrick personally aided in modifying the Steadicam's video transmission technology. Brown states his own abilities to operate the Steadicam were refined by working on Kubrick's film. For this film, Brown developed a two-handed technique, which enabled him to maintain the camera at one height while panning and tilting the camera. In addition to tracking shots from behind, the Steadicam enabled shooting in constricted rooms without flying out walls, or backing the camera into doors. Brown notes that:\n{{cquote|One of the most talked-about shots in the picture is the eerie tracking sequence which follows Danny as he pedals at high speed through corridor after corridor on his plastic [[Big Wheel (tricycle)|Big Wheel]] tricycle. The soundtrack explodes with noise when the wheel is on wooden flooring and is abruptly silent as it crosses over carpet. We needed to have the lens just a few inches from the floor and to travel rapidly just behind or ahead of the bike.}}\n\nThis required the Steadicam to be on a special mount resembling a wheelchair, in which the operator sat while pulling a platform with the sound man. The weight of the rig and its occupants proved to be too much for the original tires, resulting in a blowout one day that almost caused a serious crash. Solid tires were then mounted on the rig. Kubrick also had a highly accurate speedometer mounted on the rig so as to duplicate the exact tempo of a given shot so that Brown could perform successive identical takes.<ref>LoBrutto, p. 436</ref> Brown also discusses how the scenes in the hedge maze were shot with a Steadicam.\n\n=== Music and soundtrack ===\nThe stylistically modernist art-music chosen by Kubrick is similar to the repertoire he first explored in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. Although the repertoire was selected by Kubrick, the process of matching passages of music to motion picture was left almost entirely at the discretion of [[music editor]] Gordon Stainforth, whose work on this film is known for attention to fine details and remarkably precise synchronization without excessive splicing.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barham |first1=J.M. |title=Terror Tracks: Music and Sound in Horror Cinema |date=2009 |publisher=Equinox Press |location=London, U.K.|chapter-url=http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/1956/ |isbn=978-1845532024 |pages=137\u2013170 |chapter=Incorporating Monsters: Music as Context, Character and Construction in Kubrick\u2019s ''The Shining''|access-date=July 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804133256/http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/1956/|archive-date=August 4, 2017}}{{oa}}</ref>\n\nThe soundtrack album on LP was withdrawn due to problems with licensing of the music.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gengaro |first=Christine Lee |date=2013 |title=Listening to Stanley Kubrick: The Music in His Films |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |page=190 |isbn=9780810885646 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=LoBrutto |first=Vincent |date=1999 |title=Listening to Stanley Kubrick: The Music in His Films |publisher=Da Capo Press |page=448 |isbn=9780306809064 }}</ref> The LP soundtrack omits some pieces heard in the film, and also includes complete versions of pieces of which only fragments are heard in the film.\n\nThe non-original music on the soundtrack is as follows:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archiviokubrick.it/risorse/saggi/The_Music_in_The_Shining.pdf |title=The Music in ''The Shining'' |last=Sbravatti |first=Valerio |date=2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024042850/http://www.archiviokubrick.it/risorse/saggi/The_Music_in_The_Shining.pdf|archive-date=October 24, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n# ''[[Dies Irae#Music|Dies Irae]]'' segment from \"[[Symphonie fantastique]]\" by [[Hector Berlioz]], performed by [[Wendy Carlos]] and [[Rachel Elkind]]\n# \"Lontano\" by [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]], [[Ernest Bour]] [[conducting]] the [[Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra]] ([[WERGO|Wergo Records]])\n# \"[[Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta]]\" by [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], [[Herbert von Karajan]] conducting the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]] ([[Deutsche Grammophon]])\n# \"[[Utrenja]]\" \u2013 excerpts from the \"Ewangelia\" and \"Kanon Paschy\" movements by [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Andrzej Markowski]] conducting the [[Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra]] ([[Polskie Nagrania Muza|Polskie Nagrania Records]])\n# \"[[The Dream of Jacob|The Awakening of Jacob]]\", \"[[De Natura Sonoris|De Natura Sonoris No. 1]]\" (the latter not on the soundtrack album, [[Cracow Philharmonic Orchestra]] conducted by [[Henryk Czy\u017c]]) and \"[[De Natura Sonoris|De Natura Sonoris No. 2]]\" by Krzysztof Penderecki (Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Andrzej Markowski, Polskie Nagrania Records)\n# \"Home\", performed by [[Henry Hall (bandleader)|Henry Hall]] and the [[Gleneagles Hotel]] Band.

There were great gobs of scenes that never made it to the film. There was a whole strange and mystical scene in which Jack Nicholson discovers objects that have been arranged in his working space in the ballroom with arrows and things.

The scene shows Wendy in a bed talking with Mr. Ullman who explains that Jack's body could not be found; he then gives Danny a yellow tennis ball, presumably the same one that Jack was throwing around the hotel. This scene was subsequently physically cut out of prints by projectionists and sent back to the studio by order of [[Warner Bros.]], the film's distributor. This cut the film's running time to 144 minutes. [[Roger Ebert]] commented: {{blockquote|If Jack did indeed freeze to death in the labyrinth, of course his body was found{{snd}}and sooner rather than later, since Dick Hallorann alerted the forest rangers to serious trouble at the hotel. If Jack's body was not found, what happened to it? Was it never there? Was it absorbed into the past and does that explain Jack's presence in that final photograph of a group of hotel party-goers in 1921? Did Jack's violent pursuit of his wife and child exist entirely in Wendy's imagination, or Danny's, or theirs?&nbsp;... Kubrick was wise to remove that epilogue. It pulled one rug too many out from under the story. At some level, it is necessary for us to believe the three members of the Torrance family are actually residents in the hotel during that winter, whatever happens or whatever they think happens.<ref name=Ebert06/>}}\n\nThe general consensus among those who saw the first few shows was that the film was better without it because keeping it would weaken the Overlook's threat to the family and reintroduce Ullman, who had barely had a leading role in the story, into the conflict.<ref name=\"Hospital\">{{cite web |url=http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~butting/shining/hospital.html |title=The hospital scene |access-date=May 5, 2012 |work=The Shining.

King expressed disappointment that some themes, such as the disintegration of family and the dangers of alcoholism, are less present in the film. King also viewed the casting of Nicholson as a mistake, arguing it would result in a rapid realization among audiences that Jack would go insane, due to Nicholson's famous role as [[Randle McMurphy]] in ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' (1975). King had suggested that a more \"everyman\" actor such as [[Jon Voight]], [[Christopher Reeve]], or [[Michael Moriarty]] play the role, so that Jack's descent into madness would be more unnerving.<ref name=\"IntellectualDevotional\" /> In the novel, the story takes the child's point of view, while in the film the father is the main character; in fact, one of the most notable differences lies in Jack Torrance's psychological profile. According to the novel, the character represented an ordinary and balanced man who little by little loses control; Furthermore, the written narration reflected personal traits of the author himself at that time (marked by insomnia and alcoholism), in addition to abuse. There is some allusion to these episodes in the American version of the film.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, King criticized Duvall's performance, stating the character is \"basically just there to scream and be stupid, and that's not the woman that I wrote about.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-24126819 |title=King 'nervous' about Shining sequel |date=September 19, 2013 |website=[[BBC]]|access-date=June 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620113606/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-24126819|archive-date=June 20, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> King's Wendy is a strong and independent woman on a professional and emotional level; to Kubrick, on the other hand, it did not seem consistent that such a woman had long endured the personality of Jack Torrance.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nKing once suggested that he disliked the film's downplaying of the supernatural; King had envisioned Jack as a victim of the genuinely external forces haunting the hotel, whereas King felt Kubrick had viewed the haunting and its resulting malignancy as coming from within Jack himself.<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Stephen King]] (interviewee), Laurent Bouzerau (writer, director, producer) |date=2011 |title=A Night at the Movies: The Horrors of Stephen King |medium=Television production |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}</ref> In October 2013, however, journalist [[Laura Miller (journalist)|Laura Miller]] wrote that the discrepancy between the two was almost the complete opposite:<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/2013/10/01/what_stanley_kubrick_got_wrong_about_the_shining/ |title=What Stanley Kubrick got wrong about \"The Shining\" |last=Miller |first=Laura |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |location=San Francisco, California|date=October 1, 2013 |access-date=October 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011085212/http://www.salon.com/2013/10/01/what_stanley_kubrick_got_wrong_about_the_shining/ |archive-date=October 11, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>King is, essentially, a novelist of morality. The decisions his characters make&nbsp;\u2013 whether it's to confront a pack of vampires or to break 10 years of sobriety&nbsp;\u2013 are what matter to him. But in Kubrick's ''The Shining'', the characters are largely in the grip of forces beyond their control. It's a film in which domestic violence occurs, while King's novel is about domestic violence as a choice certain men make when they refuse to abandon a delusional, defensive entitlement. As King sees it, Kubrick treats his characters like \"insects\" because the director doesn't really consider them capable of shaping their own fates. Everything they do is subordinate to an overweening, irresistible force, which is Kubrick's highly developed aesthetic; they are its slaves. In King's ''The Shining'', the monster is Jack. In Kubrick's, the monster is Kubrick.</blockquote>\n\nKing later criticized the film and Kubrick as a director:\n<blockquote> Parts of the film are chilling, charged with a relentlessly claustrophobic terror, but others fall flat. Not that religion has to be involved in horror, but a visceral skeptic such as Kubrick just couldn't grasp the sheer inhuman evil of The Overlook Hotel. So he looked, instead, for evil in the characters and made the film into a domestic tragedy with only vaguely supernatural overtones. That was the basic flaw: because he couldn't believe, he couldn't make the film believable to others. What's basically wrong with Kubrick's version of ''The Shining'' is that it's a film by a man who thinks too much and feels too little; and that's why, for all its virtuoso effects, it never gets you by the throat and hangs on the way real horror should.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thewordslinger.com/posts.php?id=37 |title=Quoted in |publisher=Thewordslinger.com |date=March 1, 2008 |access-date=September 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831023834/http://thewordslinger.com/posts.php?id=37 |archive-date=August 31, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nKing was also disappointed by Kubrick's decision not to film at [[The Stanley Hotel]] in [[Estes Park, Colorado]], which inspired the story (a decision Kubrick made since the hotel lacked sufficient snow and electricity). However, King finally supervised the 1997 television adaptation also titled ''[[The Shining (miniseries)|The Shining]]'', filmed at The Stanley Hotel.\n\nThe animosity of King toward Kubrick's adaptation has dulled over time. During an interview segment on the [[Bravo (American TV channel)|Bravo]] channel, King stated that the first time he watched Kubrick's adaptation, he found it to be \"dreadfully unsettling\". Nonetheless, writing in the afterword of ''[[Doctor Sleep (novel)|Doctor Sleep]]'', King professed continued dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film. He said of it \"...{{nbsp}}of course there was Stanley Kubrick's movie which many seem to remember&nbsp;\u2013 for reasons I have never quite understood&nbsp;\u2013 as one of the scariest films they have ever seen.

''Doctor Sleep'' is a direct adaptation of its novel counterpart, which itself is a sequel to the novel version of ''The Shining'', but is also a continuation of Kubrick's film; in explaining the latter, Flanagan expressed, \"''The Shining'' is so ubiquitous and has burned itself into the collective imagination of people who love cinema in a way that so few movies have.

It is assigned in many college film courses, and discussed ubiquitously on the Internet}}{{efn|Blakemore is best known as a spearhead for global warming issues and having been ABC News' Vatican Correspondent since 1970.}} He believes that indirect references to American killings of Native Americans pervade the film, as exemplified by the Amerindian logos on the baking powder in the kitchen and the Amerindian artwork that appears throughout the hotel, though no Native Americans are seen. Stuart Ullman tells Wendy that when building the hotel, a few Indian attacks had to be fended off since it was constructed on an Indian burial ground.\n\nBlakemore's general argument is that the film is a metaphor for the genocide of Native Americans. He notes that when Jack kills Hallorann, the dead body is seen lying on a rug with an Indian motif. The blood in the elevator shafts is, for Blakemore, the blood of the Indians in the burial ground on which the hotel was built. The date of the final photograph, July 4, is meant to be ironic. Blakemore writes:<ref>{{cite news |last1=Blakemore |first1=Bill |title=Kubrik's Shining' Secret |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1987/07/12/kubricks-shining-secret/a7e3433d-e92e-4171-b46f-77817f1743f0/ |access-date=November 12, 2019 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=July 12, 1987 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191228132422/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1987/07/12/kubricks-shining-secret/a7e3433d-e92e-4171-b46f-77817f1743f0/ |archive-date=December 28, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=KUBRICK SHINING |url=http://williamblakemore.com/Blakemore-%20Kubrick%20Shining.pdf |website=williamblakemore.com |access-date=November 12, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191120091218/https://williamblakemore.com/Blakemore-%20Kubrick%20Shining.pdf |archive-date=November 20, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nAs with some of his other movies, Kubrick ends ''The Shining'' with a powerful visual puzzle that forces the audience to leave the theater asking, \"What was that all about?\" ''The Shining'' ends with an extremely long camera shot moving down a hallway in the Overlook, reaching eventually the central photo among 21 photos on the wall, each capturing previous good times in the hotel. At the head of the party is none other than the Jack we've just seen in 1980. The caption reads: \"Overlook Hotel&nbsp;\u2013 July 4th Ball&nbsp;\u2013 1921.\" The answer to this puzzle, which is a master key to unlocking the whole movie, is that most Americans overlook the fact that July Fourth was no ball, nor any kind of Independence day, for native Americans; that the weak American villain of the film is the re-embodiment of the American men who massacred the Indians in earlier years; that Kubrick is examining and reflecting on a problem that cuts through the decades and centuries.\n</blockquote>\n\nFilm writer John Capo sees the film as an allegory of [[American imperialism]]. This is exemplified by many clues, such as the closing photo of Jack in the past at a Fourth of July party, or Jack's earlier reference to the [[Rudyard Kipling]] poem \"[[The White Man's Burden]]\", which was written to advocate the American colonial seizure of the Philippine islands, justifying imperial conquest as a mission-of-civilization.<ref>{{cite web |last=Capo |first=John |url=http://www.tailslate.net/articles/index.asp?ID=36&lst=n&dpt=articles |title=Tailslate.net |publisher=Tailslate.net |date=September 27, 2004 |access-date=April 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803070711/http://www.tailslate.net/articles/index.asp?ID=36&lst=n&dpt=articles |archive-date=August 3, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Geoffrey Cocks and Kubrick's concern with the Holocaust ====\nFilm historian Geoffrey Cocks has extended Blakemore's idea that the film has a subtext about Native Americans by arguing that the film indirectly reflects Stanley Kubrick's concerns about the [[Holocaust]] (both Cocks' book and [[Michael Herr]]'s memoir of Kubrick discuss how he wanted his entire life to make a film dealing directly with the Holocaust but could never quite make up his mind). Cocks, writing in his book ''The Wolf at the Door: Stanley Kubrick, History and the Holocaust'', proposed a controversial theory that all of Kubrick's work is informed by the Holocaust; there is, he says, a holocaust subtext in ''The Shining''. This, Cocks believes, is why Kubrick's screenplay goes to emotional extremes, omitting much of the novel's supernaturalism and making the character of Wendy much more hysteria-prone.<ref name=\"SeeCocks\">{{Anchor|SeeCocks}}{{cite book |title=Depth of Field: Stanley Kubrick, Film, and the Uses of History |year=2006 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison, Wis. |isbn=978-0299216146 |page=174 |edition=1st |editor1=Geoffrey Cocks |editor2=James Diedrick |editor3=Glenn Perusek}}</ref> Cocks places Kubrick's vision of a haunted hotel in line with a long literary tradition of hotels in which sinister events occur, from [[Stephen Crane]]'s short story \"[[The Blue Hotel]]\" (which Kubrick admired) to the Swiss Berghof in [[Thomas Mann]]'s novel ''[[The Magic Mountain]]'', about a snowbound sanatorium high in the Swiss Alps in which the protagonist witnesses a series of events which are a microcosm of the decline of Western culture.{{sfn|Cocks|Diedrich|Perusek|2006|p=201|ref=SeeCocks}} In keeping with this tradition, Kubrick's film focuses on domesticity and the Torrances' attempt to use this imposing building as a home which Jack Torrance describes as \"homey\".\n\nCocks claims that Kubrick has elaborately coded many of his historical concerns into the film with manipulations of numbers and colors and his choice of musical numbers, many of which are post-war compositions influenced by the horrors of World War II. Of particular note is Kubrick's use of [[Krzysztof Penderecki|Penderecki]]'s ''The Awakening of Jacob'' to accompany Jack Torrance's dream of killing his family and Danny's vision of past carnage in the hotel, a piece of music originally associated with the horrors of the Holocaust.{{sfn|Cocks|Diedrich|Perusek|2006|loc=ch. 11|ref=SeeCocks}} Kubrick's pessimistic ending in contrast to Stephen King's optimistic one is in keeping with the motifs that Kubrick wove into the story.\n\nCocks's work has been anthologized and discussed in other works on Stanley Kubrick films, though sometimes with skepticism. Julian Rice, writing in the opening chapter of his book ''Kubrick's Hope'', believes Cocks's views are excessively speculative and contain too many strained \"critical leaps\" of faith. Rice holds that what went on in Kubrick's mind cannot be replicated or corroborated beyond a broad vision of the nature of good and evil (which included concern about the Holocaust) but Kubrick's art is not governed by this one obsession.<ref>Rice, Julian (2008).

Scarecrow Press, pp. 11\u201313</ref> Diane Johnson, co-screenwriter for ''The Shining'', commented on Cocks's observations, saying that preoccupation with the Holocaust on Kubrick's part could very likely have motivated his decision to place the hotel on a Native American burial ground, although Kubrick never directly mentioned it to her.{{sfn|Cocks|Diedrich|Perusek|2006|ref=SeeCocks|p=59, {{Anchor|essayDJ}}''Writing The Shining'', essay by Diane Johnson}}\n\n=== Literary allusions ===\nGeoffrey Cocks notes that the film contains many allusions to fairy tales, both ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'' and the ''[[Three Little Pigs]]'',<ref name=\"SeeCocks\"/> with Jack Torrance identified as the [[Big Bad Wolf]], which [[Bruno Bettelheim]] interprets as standing for \"all the asocial unconscious devouring powers\" that must be overcome by a child's ego.\n\nThe saying \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\" appeared first in [[James Howell|James Howell's]] ''Proverbs in English, Italian, French and Spanish'' (1659).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.famousquotesandauthors.com/authors/james_howell_quotes.html |title=James Howell Quotes |publisher=Famousquotesandauthors.com |access-date=September 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215124957/http://famousquotesandauthors.com/authors/james_howell_quotes.html |archive-date=December 15, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Ambiguities in the film ===\n[[Roger Ebert]] notes that the film does not really have a \"reliable observer\", with the possible exception of [[Dick Hallorann]].

Through&nbsp;... these devices, Kubrick dramatizes the hotel's methodical assault on Torrance's identity, its ability to stimulate the myriad of self-doubts and anxieties by creating opportunities to warp Torrance's perspective on himself and [his family]. Furthermore the fact that Jack looks into a mirror whenever he \"speaks\" to the hotel means, to some extent, that Kubrick implicates him directly into the hotel's \"consciousness\", because Jack is, in effect, talking to himself.<ref>Hollywood's Stephen King by Tony Magistrale Palgrave Macmillan 2003 pp.95\u201396</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nGhosts are the implied explanation for Jack's seemingly physically impossible escape from the locked storeroom. In an interview of Kubrick by scholar [[Michel Ciment]], the director made comments about the scene in the book that may imply he similarly thought of the scene in the film as a key reveal in this dichotomy:\n\n<blockquote>\nIt seemed to strike an extraordinary balance between the psychological and the supernatural in such a way as to lead you to think that the supernatural would eventually be explained by the psychological: 'Jack must be imagining these things because he's crazy.' This allowed you to suspend your doubt of the supernatural until you were so thoroughly into the story that you could accept it almost without noticing&nbsp;... It's not until Grady, the ghost of the former caretaker who axed to death his family, slides open the bolt of the larder door, allowing Jack to escape, that you are left with no other explanation but the supernatural.<ref>''Kubrick'' by Michel Ciment, 1983, Holt Rinehart Winston</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===<span id=\"The two Gradys\">The two Gradys and other doubles</span>===\nEarly in the film, Stuart Ullman tells Jack of a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, who, in 1970, succumbed to cabin fever, murdered his family and then killed himself. Later, Jack meets a ghostly butler named Grady. Jack says that he knows about the murders, claiming to recognize Grady from pictures, but the butler introduces himself as ''Delbert'' Grady.\n\n[[Gordon Dahlquist]] of ''The Kubrick FAQ'' argues that the name change \"deliberately mirrors Jack Torrance being both the husband of Wendy/father of Danny and the mysterious man in the 1920s July Fourth photo. It is to say he is two people: the man with choice in a perilous situation and the man who has 'always' been at the Overlook. It's a mistake to see the final photo as evidence that the events of the film are predetermined: Jack has any number of moments where he can act other than the way he does and that his (poor) choices are fueled by weakness and fear perhaps merely speaks all the more to the questions about the personal and the political that ''The Shining'' brings up. In the same way Charles had a chance \u2013 once more, perhaps \u2013 to not take on Delbert's legacy, so Jack may have had a chance to escape his role as 'caretaker' to the interests of the powerful. It's the tragic course of this story that he chooses not to.\"<ref name=\"visual-memory1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/html/shining/shining2.html#slot1120 |title=Kubrick FAQ \u2013 The Shining Part 2 |publisher=Visual-memory.co.uk |date=July 4, 1921 |access-date=June 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420133530/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/html/shining/shining2.html#slot1120 |archive-date=April 20, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Dahlquist's argument is that Delbert Grady, the 1920s butler, and Charles Grady, the 1970s caretaker, rather than being either two people or the same are two 'manifestations' of a similar entity; a part permanently at the hotel (Delbert) and the part which is given the choice of whether to join the legacy of the hotel's murderous past (Charles), just as the man in the photo is not exactly Jack Torrance but nor is he someone different. Jack in the photo has 'always' been at the Overlook; Jack the caretaker chooses to become part of the hotel. The film's assistant editor Gordon Stainforth has commented on this issue, attempting to steer a course between the continuity-error explanation on one side and the hidden-meaning explanation on the other; \"I don't think we'll ever quite unravel this. Was his full name Charles Delbert Grady? Perhaps Charles was a sort of nickname? Perhaps Ullman got the name wrong? But I also think that Stanley did NOT want the whole story to fit together too neatly, so [it is] absolutely correct, I think, to say that 'the sum of what we learn refuses to add up neatly'.\"<ref name=\"visual-memory1\" />\n\nAmong Kubrick's other doubling/mirroring effects in the film:\n* In the U.S. version, Jack's interview with Ullman, whose confident affability contrasts with Jack's seemingly forced nonchalance, is paired with Wendy's meeting with a female doctor, whose somber and professional manner contrasts with Wendy's nervousness.<ref name=Nelson>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wabgZNgT9OgC |title=Kubrick: Inside a Film Artist's Maze |last=Nelson |first=Thomas Allen |date=2000 |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |isbn=0253213908 |access-date=October 30, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228010649/https://books.google.com/books/about/Kubrick.html?id=wabgZNgT9OgC |archive-date=December 28, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n* During the interview, Jack and Ullman are joined by a hotel employee named Bill Watson, who looks similar to Jack from behind, creating a pseudo\u2013mirror image effect as they sit in chairs to the front-left and front-right of Ullman's desk.<ref name=Nelson />\n* The Grady sisters look so similar that they appear to be twins, though they are different ages (Ullman states that he thinks that they were about eight and ten).<ref name=Nelson />\n* On two occasions, Ullman says goodbye to two young female employees and in the second case, they closely resemble each other.<ref name=Nelson />\n* The film contains two mazes, the hedges outside and, per Wendy's characterization, the Overlook. The hedge maze appears in two forms, the 13-foot-high version outside and the model inside the Overlook. In the overhead shot zooming down on Wendy and Danny in the center of the maze, the maze differs from the map outside and from the model having far more corridors, and the left and right sides are mirror images of each other.

Film critic Jonathan Romney, while acknowledging the absorption theory, wrote:\n\n<blockquote>As the ghostly butler Grady (Philip Stone) tells him during their chilling confrontation in the men's toilet, 'You're the caretaker, sir. You've always been the caretaker.' Perhaps in some earlier incarnation Jack really was around in 1921, and it's his present-day self that is the shadow, the phantom photographic copy. But if his picture has been there all along, why has no one noticed it? After all, it's right at the center of the central picture on the wall, and the Torrances have had a painfully drawn-out winter of mind-numbing leisure in which to inspect every corner of the place. Is it just that, like [[The Purloined Letter|Poe's purloined letter]], the thing in plain sight is the last thing you see? When you do see it, the effect is so unsettling because you realise the unthinkable was there under your nose \u2013 overlooked \u2013 the whole time.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Spatial layout of the Overlook Hotel===\nScreenwriter [[Todd Alcott]] has noted:\n{{blockquote|Much has been written, some of it quite intelligent, about the spatial anomalies and inconsistencies in ''The Shining'': there are rooms with windows that should not be there and doors that couldn\u2019t possibly lead to anywhere, rooms appear to be in one place in one scene and another place in another, wall fixtures and furniture pieces appear and disappear from scene to scene, props move from one room to another, and the layout of the Overlook makes no physical sense.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toddalcott.com/articles/kubrick |title=Todd Alcott:What Does the Protagonist Want? |author=Todd Alcott |date=November 29, 2010 |publisher=Todd Alcott |access-date=December 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130181743/http://www.toddalcott.com/articles/kubrick |archive-date=November 30, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>}} <!--This reference is a self-published blog.

The most obvious differences are those regarding the personality of Jack Torrance (the source of much of author Stephen King's dissatisfaction with the film).<ref name=\"visual-memory2\" />\n\n===Motivation of ghosts===\nIn the film, the motive of the ghosts is apparently to \"reclaim\" Jack (although Grady expresses an interest in Danny's \"shining\" ability), who seems to be a reincarnation of a previous caretaker of the hotel, as suggested by the 1920s photograph of Jack at the end of the film and Jack's repeated claims to have \"not just a ''[[d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu]]''\".<ref>Among many other places, this is suggested in ''The Modern Weird Tale'' by S.T.

[[Timberline Lodge]], located on [[Mount Hood]] in [[Oregon]], was used for the aerial exterior shots of the fictional Overlook Hotel. The Lodge requested that Kubrick not depict Room 217 (featured in the book) in ''The Shining'', because future guests at the Lodge might be afraid to stay there, and a nonexistent room, 237, was substituted in the film.

However, the novel gives much more detail about Jack's problems with drinking and alcohol.\n\nThe film prolongs Jack's struggle with writer's block. Kubrick's co-screenwriter Diane Johnson believes that in King's novel, Jack's discovery of the scrapbook of clippings in the boiler room of the hotel, which gives him new ideas for a novel, catalyzes his possession by the ghosts of the hotel, while at the same time unblocking his writing. Jack is no longer a blocked writer, but now filled with energy. In her contribution to the screenplay, Johnson wrote an adaptation of this scene, which to her regret Kubrick later excised, as she felt this left the father's change less motivated.{{sfn|Johnson essay|2006|ref=essayDJ|p=58}} Kubrick showed Jack's continued blockage quite late in the film with the \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\" scene, which does not appear in the novel.\n\nStephen King stated on the DVD commentary of the 1997 miniseries of ''The Shining'' that the character of Jack Torrance was partially autobiographical, as he was struggling with both alcoholism and unprovoked rage toward his family at the time of writing.<ref>DVD of The Shining TV mini-series directed by Mick Garris Studio: Warner Home Video DVD Release Date: January 7, 2003</ref> [[Tony Magistrale]] wrote about Kubrick's version of Jack Torrance in ''Hollywood's Stephen King'':\n{{blockquote|[[Stanley Kubrick|Kubrick's]] version of Torrance is much closer to the tyrannical Hal (from Kubrick's ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'') and Alex (from Kubrick's ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'') than he is to King's more conflicted, more sympathetically human characterization.<ref>p. 100 of Hollywood's Stephen King By Tony Magistrale Published by Macmillan, 2003</ref>}}\n\nFrom Thomas Allen Nelson's ''Kubrick: Inside a Film Artist's Maze'': \"When Jack moves through the reception area on his way to a 'shining' over the model maze, he throws a yellow tennis ball past a stuffed bear and Danny's Big Wheel, which rests on the very spot (a Navajo circle design) where Hallorann will be murdered.\"\nJack's tennis ball mysteriously rolls into Danny's circle of toy cars just before the boy walks through the open door of Room 237.\n\n{{blockquote|In the film's opening, the camera from above moves over water and through mountains with the ease of a bird in flight.

It is implied that she has perhaps been abused by Jack as well. In the novel, she is a far more self-reliant and independent personality, who is tied to Jack in part by her poor relationship with her parents.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bailey |first=Dale |date= June 2011|title=American Nightmares: The Haunted House Formula in American Popular Fiction, p. 95 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |isbn=9780299268732 }} See also the novel Chapter 5, ''Phone Booth'', and Chapter 6, ''Night Thoughts''.</ref> In the novel, she never displays hysteria or collapses the way she does in the film, but remains cool and self-reliant. Writing in ''Hollywood's Stephen King'', author Tony Magistrale writes about the mini-series remake:\n\n<blockquote>\n[[Rebecca De Mornay|De Mornay]] restores much of the steely resilience found in the protagonist of King's novel and this is particularly noteworthy when compared to Shelley Duvall's exaggerated portrayal of Wendy as [[Olive Oyl]] revisited: A simpering fatality of forces beyond her capacity to understand, much less surmount.<ref>Magistrale, p. 202.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nCo-screenwriter Diane Johnson stated that in her contributions to the script, Wendy had more dialogue, and that Kubrick cut many of her lines, possibly due to his dissatisfaction with actress Shelley Duvall's delivery. Johnson believes that the earlier draft of the script portrayed Wendy as a more-rounded character.{{sfn|Johnson essay|2006|ref=essayDJ|p=56}}\n\n===Stuart Ullman===\nIn the novel, Jack's interviewer, Ullman, is highly authoritarian, a kind of snobbish martinet. The film's Ullman is far more humane and concerned about Jack's well-being, as well as smooth and self-assured. Only in the novel does Ullman state that he disapproves of hiring Jack but higher authorities have asked that Jack be hired.<ref>Jack's disdain for Ullman is the main subject of Chapter 1 of the novel, setting up Jack's authority issues.</ref> Ullman's bossy nature in the novel is one of the first steps in Jack's deterioration, whereas in the film, Ullman serves largely as an expositor.\n\nIn ''Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation'', author Greg Jenkins writes \"A toadish figure in the book, Ullman has been utterly reinvented for the film; he now radiates charm, grace and gentility.\"<ref>p. 74 of ''Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation: Three Novels, Three Films'' by Greg Jenkins, published by McFarland, 1997</ref>\n\nFrom ''Kubrick: Inside a Film Artist's Maze'': Ullman tells Jack that the hotel's season runs from May 15 to October 30, meaning that the Torrances moved in on [[Halloween]] (October 31). On Ullmann's desk next to a small American flag sits a metal cup containing pencils and a pen&nbsp;\u2013 and a miniature replica of an ax.\n\n\"When Ullman, himself all smiles, relates as a footnote the story about the former caretaker who 'seemed perfectly normal' but nevertheless cut up his family with an ax, Jack's obvious interest (as if he's recalling one of his own nightmares) and his insincere congeniality (early signs of a personality malfunction) lead the viewer to believe that the film's definition of his madness will be far more complex.\"<ref>Nelson, p. 200, 206, 210</ref>\n\n===Family dynamics===\nStephen King provides the reader with a great deal of information about the stress in the Torrance family early in the story,<ref>Rasmussen, 233\u20134. See also novel Chapter 6, \"Night Thoughts\".</ref> including revelations of Jack's physical abuse of Danny and Wendy's fear of Danny's mysterious spells. Kubrick tones down the early family tension and reveals family disharmony much more gradually than does King. In the film, Danny has a stronger emotional bond with Wendy than with Jack, which fuels Jack's rather paranoid notion that the two are conspiring against him. The exact opposite is true in the book, where Wendy occasionally experiences jealousy at the fact that Danny clearly prefers Jack to her.\n\n===Plot differences===\nIn the novel Jack recovers his sanity and goodwill through the intervention of Danny while this does not occur in the film. Writing in ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' magazine, Frederick Clarke suggests, \"Instead of playing a normal man who becomes insane, Nicholson portrays a crazy man attempting to remain sane.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clarke |first1=Frederick |year=1996 |title=The Shining |journal=Cinefastique |volume=28 }}</ref> In the novel, Jack's final act is to enable Wendy and Danny to escape the hotel before it explodes due to a defective boiler, killing him.<ref>{{cite book |title=American nightmares: the haunted house formula in American popular fiction |last=Bailey |first=Dale |year=1999 |publisher=Popular Press |isbn=978-0-879727-89-5 |page=62}}</ref> The film ends with the hotel still standing.
