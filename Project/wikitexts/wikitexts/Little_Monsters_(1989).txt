One morning, Brian finds himself blamed and wrongfully punished for several things he did not do. Insisting on his innocence, he blames his 8-year-old younger brother, Eric, who claims to have seen a monster the night before. At school, Brian gets into a fight with bully Ronnie Coleman. That night, upon returning to Eric's room to sleep for a bet, Brian finds the room in shambles, and sees the TV remote supernaturally slide and disappear under the bed. The next morning, Eric and his friend Todd find Brian on the living room couch and joke about Brian being unable to sleep the entire night in Eric's room. Brian bets Eric \"double or nothing\" to sleep in Eric's room another night. The next night, a determined Brian sets booby traps, and leaves cheese [[Doritos]] as bait to attract the alleged \"monster.\"\n\nBrian succeeds in trapping the monster intruder: a blue-skinned humanoid named Maurice. Though initially scared, Brian soon discovers that he and Maurice share the same interests and befriends him. Brian also learns that sunlight causes the monsters to collapse into piles of clothes. Over several nights, Maurice shows him a fun time in the monster world beneath Eric's bed. It consists of every child's dream: all the [[junk food]] and video games available, with no adults to supervise. It also has innumerable [[staircase]]s leading to the spaces beneath children's beds, from which the monsters cause trouble. Maurice and Brian have fun making mischief in other people's homes, and Brian also befriends a girl named Kiersten at his school. However, at the same time, Brian also begins to notice Maurice's ways of causing mischief can go too far sometimes, as evidenced when Maurice eats Kiersten's papers for an important science project she was working on, causing her to get a grade of zero. Brian also becomes disheartened when he believes that his parents may possibly get a divorce.\n\nOne night, Maurice brings Brian along with several other monsters to the bedroom of an infant baby, intending to scare it. Finding this to be cruel, Brian opens the bedroom door, exposing the hallway light to the baby's bedroom, but subsequently learns that he is turning into a monster, as his body parts shrink when the light hits him. He escapes the house through the front door and walks through Todd's backyard, where Todd is sleeping in a treehouse. Todd shines a flashlight on Brian, shrinking Brian's arm in the process. The concerned Brian saws off the legs of all the beds in his house.\n\nDue to Maurice's failure to convert Brian (all monsters are former [[child]]ren), Eric is kidnapped by Snik \u2014 another, much crueler monster \u2014 through the [[couch bed]] in the [[living room]]. Brian enlists help from Todd and Kiersten. Gathering an assortment of bright lights, they enter the monster universe looking for Eric. \"Zapping\" various monsters along the way, they march to the master [[staircase]], where Boy, the ruler of the monster world, resides. Boy offers to release Eric and Brian's friends if Brian agrees to convert, but Brian refuses. The bright lights are destroyed and they are all placed with Maurice in a locked dungeon-type room. They manage to escape by turning Maurice into a pile of [[clothes]] via an improvised light and slide him through the door crack. They re-arm themselves with more powerful lights, recruit Ronnie, and venture back into the monster world. They return to Boy's domain, and are able to defeat him, while Maurice defeats Snik with a [[flamethrower]].\n\nUnfortunately, Brian and the others find that they cannot return home because the sun has risen. Faced with the prospect of turning into monsters if they do not return to the human world by [[sunrise]], the children travel in the monster world from the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern time zone]] to [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] where the sun has not risen yet and they manage to escape. Before entering the human world, Brian shares a heartfelt goodbye with Maurice, who gives Brian his leather vest as a memento, promising to meet again with him someday. The kids run to a payphone and Brian calls home to say that he and Eric are in Malibu and begins to explain their story to their parents.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Fred Savage]] as Brian Stevenson, an 11-year-old boy\n* [[Howie Mandel]] as Maurice, a monster whom Brian befriends\n* [[Ben Savage]] as Eric Stevenson, Brian's younger brother\n* [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as Glen Stevenson, Brian's hot-tempered father\n* [[Margaret Whitton]] as Holly Stevenson, Brian's mother\n* [[Frank Whaley]] as Boy, ruler of the monster world\n* [[Rick Ducommun]] as Snik, Boy's right-hand man\n* [[Amber Barretto]] as Kiersten, a girl Brian likes\n* [[Devin Ratray]] as Ronnie Coleman, a bully who bothers Brian\n* William Murray Weiss as Todd, Eric's best friend<ref>{{Citation|title=Little Monsters|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleMonsters|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=November 2020}}\n\nBrian's father Glen is played by [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]], who was working on ''[[The Wonder Years]]'' as the elder, retrospective (voice-over) version of Savage's character, Kevin Arnold.

It subsequently saw a limited release, with only 179 [[movie theater]]s showing the film at its high point, although it grossed just under US$800,000. A [[DVD]] release was made available in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] on April 6, 2004. [[Lionsgate]] released the film on [[Blu-ray]] for the first time as part of their \"Vestron Video Collector's Series\" line on September 15, 2020.\n\n== Reception ==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 44% based on reviews from 9 critics.<ref>{{cite web |title=Little Monsters (1989) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/little_monsters |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\nChris Willman of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' found Howie Mandel's monster Maurice to be uncannily close to ''[[Beetlejuice (film)|Beetlejuice]]'' although this film is for children. He notes that \"there's sweetness and whimsicality in its fantasy, but there\u2019s also a fair amount of gross-out humor\" and admits that \"some of it is actually funny\". Willman says the film ultimately turns into a special-effects extravaganza, but seems to have been held back by its limited budget.<ref name=\"Willman\">{{Cite web |date=1989-08-26 |author=Chris Willman |title=MOVIE REVIEW: A Lighthearted 'Little Monsters' |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-08-26-ca-864-story.html |access-date=2020-10-20}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of American films of 1989]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.fast-rewind.com/littlemonsters.htm ''Little Monsters'' Review] at \"The 80s Movie Rewind\"\n* [https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3294529025/weekend/ ''Little Monsters'' (1989)] at [[Box Office Mojo]]\n* {{IMDb title|0097758|Little Monsters}}\n* {{Amg title|29573|Little Monsters}}\n* {{mojo title|littlemonsters|Little Monsters}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JK-nlr5JcA''I Wanna Yell''] at [[YouTube]]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD9PQ96-KWk''Magic Of The Night''] at [[YouTube]]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMXNiw4H6qA''Road to Nowhere''] at [[YouTube]] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201222150402/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMXNiw4H6qA |date=2020-12-22 }}\n\n[[Category:1980s adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:1989 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s monster movies]]\n[[Category:1989 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1989 films]]\n[[Category:1989 independent films]]\n[[Category:American adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:American children's comedy films]]\n[[Category:American children's fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American monster movies]]\n[[Category:Davis Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Fictional duos]]\n[[Category:Films produced by John Davis]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Newman]]\n[[Category:Films set in Boston]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Films shot in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Ted Elliott]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Terry Rossio]]\n[[Category:United Artists films]]\n[[Category:Vestron Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]\n[[Category:Films about children]]\n[[Category:Films about brothers]]"}]}}}}
