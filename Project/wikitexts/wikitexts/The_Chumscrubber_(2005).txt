Some of the themes addressed in the film are the lack of communication between teenagers and their parents and the inauthenticity of [[suburb]]ia. The titular Chumscrubber is a character in a fictional video game that represents the town and its inhabitants.\n\nPosin and Stanford had originally planned to shoot the film using their own funds, but they sent the script to producers [[Lawrence Bender]] and [[Bonnie Curtis]] who agreed to produce the film and help to raise the budget. Bell was cast in the lead role after an extensive auditioning process, and the film was shot in various California locations over 30 days in April 2004.\n\n''The Chumscrubber'' premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 25, 2005 and was released theatrically on August 26, 2005. An accompanying soundtrack, composed mostly by [[James Horner]], was released on October 18, 2005. The film was both a critical and commercial failure, receiving mostly negative reviews and earning back only US$350,000 of its $10 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nTroy Johnson, the supplier of prescription drugs to fellow high school students in the fictional southern California town of Hillside, commits suicide. Troy's best friend Dean {{Not a typo|Stiffle}} finds his dead body but does not show any emotion about the loss of his friend. Dean is prescribed antidepressants by his psychiatrist father Bill to help \"even him out\". When Dean returns to school, he is antagonized by drug dealers Billy and Lee, who were supplied by Troy. Their friend, Crystal Falls flirts with Dean, but he soon realizes that her true intentions are for Dean to retrieve the remaining drugs in Troy's home, and he refuses to cooperate. To force Dean to procure the drugs, Billy and Lee plan to kidnap Dean's younger brother, Charlie as ransom, but instead they mistakenly kidnap another boy, Charlie Bratley.\n\nThe kidnappers hold Charlie Bratley overnight at Crystal's home. Bratley's parents are unaware that he is even missing. Dean eventually agrees to go to Troy's house to find the drugs. Upon delivery, Billy discovers that the bag does not contain the prescription drugs and starts a fight with Dean, leading to Dean's arrest. While trying to explain everything to Officer Lou Bratley, Charlie's father, Dean reveals that his brother Charlie replaced the drugs with a bag of the vitamins that their mother Allie sells. Neither Officer Bratley nor Dean's father believes his story, but he is released, whereupon his father increases his dosage of antidepressants. Meanwhile, Charlie {{Not a typo|Stiffle}} crushes the real drugs and intentionally puts them into a casserole that his mother made for Troy's memorial.\n\nThe next day is Troy's memorial service and the wedding of Mayor Michael Ebbs to Charlie Bratley's mother Terri. Lou finally realizes that his son actually has been kidnapped and begins to look for him. At Lee's house, Crystal asks Lee to help stop the kidnapping scheme, but he does not comply. Crystal goes to Dean's house for help, where she finds him hallucinating about Troy's death and finally expressing his grief. Meanwhile, a paranoid Lee, encouraged by Billy, tries to kill Charlie Bratley to avoid being caught, but Charlie fights back and slices the knife through Billy's eye. Billy runs out into the street, screaming in pain, and is hit by Lou's police car.\n\nDean attends Troy's memorial, where all of the visitors are intoxicated by the drugs that are in his mother's casserole. Troy's mother, Carrie discloses to Dean that she never knew her son. Dean tells her about Troy and acknowledges that they were best friends, and she thanks him. Billy is later sent to prison.  Lee, who successfully changes the narrative of his involvement during the trial, is acquitted. A closing voiceover explains that Dean and Crystal \"escape together\", and they are shown kissing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Anchor|Characters}}\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as Dean {{Not a typo|Stiffle}}, a teenage outsider and the film's protagonist. He refuses to face his grief over his best friend's suicide, instead choosing to numb his feelings with drugs.\n* [[Camilla Belle]] as Crystal Falls, Dean's rebellious classmate. Unlike her friends, she feels sympathy for Dean and is reluctant to partake in the plans to kidnap his brother.\n* [[Justin Chatwin]] as Billy Peck, a drug dealer at Dean's high school who was formerly supplied by Troy. He dreams to join the air force after graduation, but his fight with Charlie Bratley leaves him with impaired vision.\n* [[Lou Taylor Pucci]] as Lee Parker, Billy's smart but timid friend who often succumbs to peer pressure. His parents pressure him about his schoolwork, hoping for him to get into a good college.\n* [[Rory Culkin]] as Charlie {{Not a typo|Stiffle}}, Dean's younger brother. He spends most of his time on the family couch playing video games.\n* [[Thomas Curtis (actor)|Thomas Curtis]] as Charlie Bratley, the 13-year-old son of Officer Lou Bratley and his ex-wife Terri. Having been largely ignored by his negligent mother, at the end of the film he is sent to live with Lou.\n* [[Glenn Close]] as Carrie Johnson, Troy's devastated mother. She tries to mask her grief with a cheerful persona, and continually guilts her neighbors by telling them bluntly that she does not blame them for Troy's death.\n* [[William Fichtner]] as Bill {{Not a typo|Stiffle}}, Dean's psychiatrist father who uses Dean as the subject of his books. Though he spends his life always looking for potential new material, his book sales turn out to be disappointing.\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as Michael Ebbs, the mayor of Hillside and Terri Bratley's fianc\u00e9. After suffering a head injury and spilling paint in the shape of a dolphin, he becomes infatuated with dolphins and paints them all over his house; at the end of the film, he resigns from politics and becomes an artist.\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Lou Bratley, a police officer and Charlie Bratley's father. He cannot let go of his previous marriage with Terri, and finds satisfaction in giving her copious parking tickets.\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Allie {{Not a typo|Stiffle}}, Dean's overworked mother. She initially struggles to sell her VeggiForce vitamins, but by the end of the film, she has found success and VeggiForce has become something of a cult.\n* Josh Janowicz as Troy Johnson, Dean's best friend and the supplier of prescription drugs to the student body at his high school. After his suicide, he appears frequently in Dean's hallucinations.\n* [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as Jerri Falls, Crystal's laidback mother. She is obsessed with Terri Bratley's interior design work, but cannot catch her attention until she tells Terri that her son was at Jerri's house.\n* [[Rita Wilson]] as Terri Bratley, a successful interior designer and Charlie's mother. She grows increasingly frustrated and demanding as her wedding to Michael approaches, and by the end of the film her design efforts have become less fruitful.\n\n==Themes==\nThe title of the film refers to a video game character, \"The Chumscrubber\", who helps his friends to survive in a superficial world by keeping things authentic, and is portrayed as a post-apocalyptic hero, carrying his severed head in his hand as he fights the forces of evil. The Chumscrubber's world was intended to be a reflection of the Hillside community, shown by the repetition of characters' lines in the video game; a voice in the game yells \"Kill him! Stab him! Get him again!\", the exact line said by Billy to Lee at the end of the film, urging him to stab Charlie Bratley.<ref name=cool>{{cite web| title = CHUMSCRUBBER duo Arie Posin and Bonnie Curtis chat up Quint| publisher = [[Ain't It Cool News]] | url = https://www.aintitcool.com/?q=node/21039| date = August 18, 2005| access-date = December 30, 2009}}</ref> Producer [[Bonnie Curtis]] described the character as \"this sub-human monster the kids feel they are becoming\".<ref name=studio2>{{cite web| title = The Chumscrubber| publisher = WritingStudio.co.za| url = http://www.writingstudio.co.za/page1049.html| access-date = January 2, 2010| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721203635/http://www.writingstudio.co.za/page1049.html| archive-date = July 21, 2011}}</ref> Posin commented that \"the Chumscrubber is everything that that community has suppressed or denied or tried to ignore, and [...] the idea that the collective denial of the community as a whole finally gives birth to a character that will not be ignored\".<ref name=hybrid>{{cite web| title =The Chumscrubber\u2014Nathan Baran interviews director Arie Posin | work = Hybrid Magazine | url = http://www.hybridmagazine.com/films/0805/chumscrubber-interview.shtml | last = Baran | first = Nathan| date = August 2005 | access-date = December 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\nPosin stated that one theme of the film is that \"the adults in this world tend to be immature or childish and the kids tend to be very mature and adult and sophisticated for their age\".<ref name=\"cool\" /> He shot the teenage characters slightly below eye level to create the impression of looking up at an adult, and shot the adults slightly above eye level as if the viewer were looking down at a child.<ref name=\"cool\" /> He said that hypocrisy was \"at the top of the list\" of the themes he wanted to explore in the story.<ref name=\"studio\" /> While all of the adults in the film are attempting to live perfect lives, they cannot see that their children are driven to suicide, antidepressant addiction and kidnapping &ndash; for instance, Terri is so obsessed with her upcoming wedding that she does not realize her son is missing.<ref name=\"studio\">{{cite web| title = The art of writing and making films: The Chumscrubber| publisher = WritingStudio.co.za| url = http://www.writingstudio.co.za/page1048.html| access-date = December 30, 2009| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721203606/http://www.writingstudio.co.za/page1048.html| archive-date = July 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe film features dolphins as a recurring motif.
