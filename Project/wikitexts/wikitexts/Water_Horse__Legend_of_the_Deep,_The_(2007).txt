It stars [[Alex Etel]] as a young boy who discovers a mysterious egg and cares for what hatches out of it: a \"[[water horse]]\" (loosely based on the [[Kelpie|Celtic water horse]]) which later becomes the fabled [[Loch Ness Monster]]. The film also stars [[Emily Watson]], [[Ben Chaplin]] and [[David Morrissey]].\n\nThe film was produced by [[Revolution Studios]] and [[Walden Media]], in collaboration with [[Beacon Pictures]], and was distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]].

Lewis Mowbray comes to work as a handyman there. Angus' father Charles, the former handyman, is a sailor in the [[Royal Navy]], missing since his ship was sunk in [[World War II|the war]] a year ago; Angus is unable to accept that he won't return.\n\nOne day, while collecting seashells, Angus discovers a large, mysterious egg in the sand, and an unknown creature hatches, which he calls 'Crusoe' after [[Robinson Crusoe]]. He decides to keep the creature a secret, eventually telling his sister and Lewis. Lewis explains that it is a [[parthenogenesis|genderless]] \"[[Water Horse]]\" that lays one egg, then dies before it hatches.\n\n[[Royal Air Force]] troops arrive at the house, commanded by Captain Thomas Hamilton \u2013 a friend of Lord Killin. An artillery battery is set up near the lake to defend against German [[U-boats]] while the troops set up on the grounds. Meanwhile, Lewis decides Crusoe is so big they have to free it in the loch.\n\nCaptain Hamilton proclaims Lewis to be a bad influence, and Angus' mother allows him to teach Angus some discipline. After a few days of training, he escapes, returning to the lake and a full-grown Crusoe, who gets Angus to ride on its back. After some time, it begins to dive. Angus protests diving, later enjoys himself and finally overcomes his phobia.\n\nThe next day, Captain Hamilton takes the MacMorrow family to a hill overlooking Loch Ness; Crusoe is almost hit by an exploding shell during a firing demonstration. Angus interrupts to save Crusoe from injury or death, enraging Hamilton and irritating his mother, who is unfamiliar with Water Horses and won't believe him. He is punished, having to be in his room at six every night for a month.\n\nTwo fishermen who had seen Crusoe, try to take a photo of the creature for fame and fortune. When they can't photograph the real thing due to the bombardment, they create an imitation. (The result is the real-life faked photo of The Loch Ness Monster known as \"[[The Loch Ness Monster#\"Surgeon's Photograph\" (1934)|The Surgeon's Photo]]\".) It interests a few soldiers, who go out to hunt it.\n\nSneaking out of his room with his sister's help, Angus visits the lake, calling for Crusoe. Crusoe rises, still in shock and fear from the earlier bombardment, nearly bites off Angus's hand before sinking back into the loch. Hamilton's dog Churchill, having smelled Crusoe from the shore, alerts the soldiers of its presence before being eaten by Crusoe. Crusoe then surprises the soldiers, capsizing their boat but not before one of them sends out an SOS to Hamilton, who thinks the Germans are attacking. At the loch, Angus calls out to Crusoe, who is attacking Strunk. In his attempt to calm Crusoe, Angus wades into the lake, slips and sinks.\n\nCrusoe rescues Angus. When his mother arrives, she finally believes him when she sees Crusoe, though at first she accuses Lewis of filling Angus's head with nonsense. The nearby artillery battery soon opens fire upon Crusoe, mistaking it for a German U-Boat. Angus, Hamilton, Anne and Lewis lead Crusoe to safety at the net, who escapes into the sea.\n\nAt sunrise, Angus finally accepts his father has passed before they watch Crusoe go. It is implied that Anne is also ready to move on, having fallen in love with Lewis. Over the years, several people claim spotting it but Angus never sees Crusoe again while others say that it returns, seeking Angus.\n\nThe tourists thank the old storyteller and ask for his name, which he reveals to be Angus MacMorrow. Outside the pub, a mother calls out to her son William, who is walking down the beach. He spots a large 'rock', which has an iridescent blue shell just like Crusoe's, hinting that Crusoe has left a descendant behind to become the next Water Horse.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alex Etel]] as Angus MacMorrow\n** [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Older Angus MacMorrow\n**Louis Owen Collins as young Angus MacMorrow\n* [[Emily Watson]] as Anne MacMorrow\n* [[Ben Chaplin]] as Lewis Mowbray\n* [[David Morrissey]] as Captain Thomas Hamilton\n* [[Priyanka Xi]] as Kirstie MacMorrow\n* [[Marshall Napier]] as Sgt.

Most of the film was shot in New Zealand, with Queenstown's [[Lake Wakatipu]] doubling for a Scottish Loch.

Loch Ness is actually a freshwater loch with its surface some {{convert|80|ft|m}} above sea level, and is connected to the sea (about {{convert|5|mi|km|0|abbr=out|disp=or}} to the north) by the shallow [[River Ness]], which flows through the city of [[Inverness]]. For this reason, anti-submarine nets would not have been needed on Loch Ness, as no submarines would have been able to navigate the river, even if there had been important military targets in the loch (which there weren't); the actual operation of the anti-submarine nets shown in the film owes little to reality.\n* During scenes set underwater, the loch has fairly clear waters. In reality Loch Ness has very opaque waters, with visibility mostly being less than {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe film also has some chronological inconsistencies:\n* The production of the \"Surgeon's Photograph\" of the [[Loch Ness Monster|monster]] is shown as part of the plot. The real \"Surgeon's Photograph\" was published in 1934, eight years before the film is set. In the film, the \"Surgeon\" is unable to catch a photo of the actual monster, and instead rigs up a fake monster for purposes of the photograph.\n* Angus has a toy ship which is clearly seen as the [[SS United States|SS ''United States'']]. The real SS ''United States'' was built between 1950 and 1951 and first sailed in 1952, a decade after the events of the film.\n\n==Box office==\nThe film was a moderate box office success and grossed about $9&nbsp;million during its opening weekend. As of October 2010, the film has grossed a total of $103,071,443 worldwide due to gaining about $40.4&nbsp;million in the United States and about $62.1&nbsp;million in foreign countries, according to the website Box Office Mojo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=waterhorse.htm |title=The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep (2007) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |access-date=2 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Home video==\nThe film was released on DVD and [[Blu-ray]] on 8 April 2008, with 646,841 units sold in the opening weekend for a total of $12,678,084. As of 2012, 1,611,757 units had been sold for a total of $30,598,707.<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2007/WHRSE-DVD.php The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep \u2013 DVD Sales].
