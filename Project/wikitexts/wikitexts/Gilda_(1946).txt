The film is known for cinematographer [[Rudolph Mat\u00e9]]'s lush photography, costume designer [[Jean Louis]]'s wardrobe for Hayworth (particularly for the dance numbers), and choreographer [[Jack Cole (choreographer)|Jack Cole]]'s staging of \"[[Put the Blame on Mame]]\" and \"[[Amado Mio]]\", sung by [[Anita Kert Ellis|Anita Ellis]]. Over the years ''Gilda'' has gained [[cult classic]] status.<ref>Grossini, Giancarlo (1 January 1985).

He is rescued from a robbery attempt by a complete stranger, Ballin Mundson. Mundson tells him about an illegal high-class casino, but warns him not to cheat there. Farrell ignores his advice, wins at [[blackjack]], and is taken to see the casino's owner, who turns out to be Mundson. Farrell talks Mundson into hiring him and soon becomes Mundson's trusted casino manager.\n\nMundson returns from a trip and announces he has a new wife, Gilda, whom he has married after only knowing her for a day. Johnny and Gilda instantly recognize each other, though both deny it when Mundson questions them. Mundson assigns Farrell to watch over Gilda. Johnny and Gilda are consumed with hatred for each other, and she cavorts with men at all hours in increasingly more blatant efforts to enrage Johnny, and in return he grows more spiteful towards her.\n\nMundson is visited by two [[Germany|German]] mobsters. Their organization financed a [[tungsten]] [[cartel]], with everything put in Mundson's name in order to hide their connection to it. They have decided that it is safe to take over the cartel now that [[World War II]] has ended, but Mundson refuses to transfer ownership. The Argentinian police are suspicious of the Germans and assign agent Obregon to try to obtain information from Farrell, but he knows nothing about this aspect of Mundson's operations. The Germans return to the casino during a carnival celebration, and Mundson ends up killing one of them.\n\nFarrell rushes to take Gilda to safety. Alone in Mundson's house, they have another confrontation and after declaring their undying hatred for each other, passionately kiss. After hearing the front door slam, they realize Mundson has overheard and a guilt-ridden Farrell pursues him to a waiting private airplane. The plane explodes in midair and plummets into the ocean.  Mundson parachutes to safety.  Farrell, unaware of this, concludes that Mundson has committed suicide.\n\nGilda inherits his estate. Farrell and she immediately marry, but unknown to her, Johnny is marrying her to punish her for her betrayal of Mundson. He abandons her, but has her followed day and night by his men to torment her. Gilda tries to escape the tortured marriage a number of times, but Farrell thwarts every attempt.\n\nObregon confiscates the casino and informs Farrell that Gilda was never truly unfaithful to Mundson or to him, prompting Farrell to try to reconcile with her. At that moment, Mundson reappears, revealing he faked his suicide. He tries to kill both Gilda and Farrell, but bartender Uncle Pio fatally stabs him. When Obregon arrives, Johnny tries to take the blame for the murder, but Obregon points out that Mundson was already declared legally dead and declines to arrest him.  Farrell gives Obregon incriminating documents from Mundson's safe.  Farrell and Gilda reconcile.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Gilda trailer rita hayworth2.JPG|Johnny Farrell ([[Glenn Ford]]) and Gilda ([[Rita Hayworth]])\nFile:Gilda trailer hayworth1.JPG|\"Gilda, are you decent?\"\n</gallery>\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Gilda trailer rita hayworth3 crop.JPG|thumb|right|Costume designer [[Jean Louis]] called the [[black dress of Rita Hayworth|black strapless gown]] worn by Rita Hayworth in ''Gilda'' \"the most famous dress I ever made.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glamamor.com/2014/10/RitaHayworth-GILDA-JeanLouis.html |title=Style Essentials\u2014Femme Fatale Rita Hayworth Puts the Blame in 1946's ''Gilda'' |last=Truhler |first=Kimberly |date=October 17, 2014|website=GlamAmor |access-date=2017-06-02}}</ref>]]\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Rita Hayworth]] as Gilda Mundson\n* [[Glenn Ford]] as Johnny Farrell \n* [[George Macready]] as Ballin Mundson\n* [[Joseph Calleia]] as Detective Maurice Obregon\n* [[Steven Geray]] as Uncle Pio\n* [[Joe Sawyer]] as Casey\n* [[Gerald Mohr]] as Captain Delgado\n* [[Mark Roberts (actor)|Mark Roberts]] as Gabe Evans\n* [[Ludwig Donath]] as German\n* [[Don Douglas]] as Thomas Langford\n* [[Lionel Royce]] as German\n* [[George J.
