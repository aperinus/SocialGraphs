Upon release, the film garnered mixed reviews, but in subsequent years it has been recognized as a classic of [[world cinema]], with the [[British Film Institute]] ranking it #29 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Films of All Time\".<ref name=\"BFI Top 50 2012\" /> The film sold over 4 million tickets, mostly in the [[Soviet Union]], against a budget of 1 million [[Soviet rouble|rouble]]s.<ref name=\"johnson-139-140\" /><ref name=bo/>\n\n== Title ==\nThe meaning of the word \"stalker\" was derived from its use by the [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky|Strugatsky brothers]] in their novel ''[[Roadside Picnic]]'', upon which the movie is based. In ''Roadside Picnic'', \"Stalker\" was a common nickname for men engaged in the illegal enterprise of prospecting for and smuggling alien artifacts out of the \"Zone\".  According to author Boris Strugatsky, \"prospectors\" and \"trappers\" were potential word choices before \"stalker\" was decided on, which was at least partially inspired by [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s character \"Stalky\" in his ''[[Stalky & Co.]]'' stories, of which both authors were fans.  Their adaptation of the English word into Russian is pronounced slightly differently as \"Stullker\", and it came into common usage after being \"coined\" by the authors.<ref name=\"Roadside Picnic\">{{cite book |last1=Strugatsky |first1=Arkady and Boris |title=Roadside Picnic |date=2012 |publisher=Chicago Review Press, Incorporated |isbn=978-1-61374-341-6 |page=197}}</ref>\n\nTarkovsky also wrote \"Stalker is from the word 'to stalk'\u2014to creep.\" in a 1976 diary entry.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tarkovsky |first=Andrei |date=1991 |title=Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970\u20131986|url=https://monoskop.org/images/d/dd/Tarkovsky_Andrey_Time_Within_Time_The_Diaries_1970-1986.pdf |access-date=2016-05-04 |publisher=Seagull Books |page=136 |isbn=81-7046-083-2}}</ref>\n\nIn the film, a \"stalker\" is a professional guide to the Zone, someone having the ability and desire to cross the border into the dangerous and forbidden place with a specific goal.<ref name=slant/><ref name=\"toninoguerra\">{{citation|last= {{ill|John Gianvito|WD=Q112122002}}|title=Andrei Tarkovsky: Interviews|publisher= University Press of Mississippi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKp-hAuQ_2oC |year=2006 |pages=50\u201354 |isbn=1-57806-220-9}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nThe protagonist ([[Alexander Kaidanovsky]]) works in an unnamed location as a \"Stalker\" leading people through the \"Zone\", an area in which the normal laws of physics do not apply and remnants of seemingly extraterrestrial activity lie undisturbed among its ruins. The Zone contains a place called the \"Room\", said to grant the wishes of anyone who steps inside. The area containing the Zone is shrouded in secrecy, sealed off by the government and surrounded by ominous hazards.\n\nAt home with his wife and daughter, the Stalker's wife ([[Alisa Freindlich]]) begs him not to go into the Zone, but he dismissively rejects her pleas. In a rundown bar-caf\u00e9, the Stalker meets his next clients for a trip into the Zone, the Writer ([[Anatoly Solonitsyn]]) and the Professor ([[Nikolai Grinko]]).\n\nThey evade the military blockade that guards the Zone by following a train inside the gate and ride into the heart of the Zone on a [[Railroad speeder | railway work car]]. The Stalker tells his clients they must do exactly as he says to survive the dangers which lie ahead and explains that the Zone must be respected and the straightest path is not always the shortest path. The Stalker tests for various \"traps\" by throwing metal nuts tied to strips of cloth ahead of them. He refers to a previous Stalker named \"Porcupine\", who had led his brother to his death in the Zone, visited the Room, come into possession of a large sum of money, and shortly afterwards committed suicide. The Writer is skeptical of any real danger, but the Professor generally follows the Stalker's advice.\n\nAs they travel, the three men discuss their reasons for wanting to visit the Room. The Writer expresses his fear of losing his inspiration. The Professor seems less anxious, although he insists on carrying along a small backpack. The Professor admits he hopes to win a [[Nobel Prize]] for scientific analysis of the Zone. The Stalker insists he has no motive beyond the altruistic aim of aiding the desperate to their desires.\n\nAfter traveling through the tunnels, the three finally reach their destination: a decayed and decrepit industrial building. In a small antechamber, a phone rings. The surprised Professor decides to use the phone to telephone a colleague. As the trio approach the Room, the Professor reveals his true intentions in undertaking the journey. The Professor has brought a 20-kiloton bomb with him, and he intends to destroy the Room to prevent its use by evil men. The three men enter a physical and verbal standoff just outside the Room that leaves them exhausted.\n\nThe Writer realizes that when Porcupine met his goal, despite his conscious motives, the room fulfilled Porcupine's secret desire for wealth rather than bring back his brother from death. This prompted the guilt-ridden Porcupine to commit suicide. The Writer tells them that no one in the whole world is able to know their true desires and as such it is impossible to use the Room for selfish reasons. The Professor gives up on his plan of destroying the Room. Instead, he disassembles his bomb and scatters its pieces. No one attempts to enter the Room.\n\nThe Stalker, the Writer, and the Professor are met back at the bar-caf\u00e9 by the Stalker's wife and daughter. After returning home, the Stalker tells his wife how humanity has lost its faith and belief needed for both traversing the Zone and living a good life. As the Stalker sleeps, his wife contemplates their relationship in a monologue delivered [[Breaking the fourth wall|directly to the camera]]. In the last scene, Martyshka, the couple's deformed daughter, sits alone in the kitchen reading as a love poem by [[Fyodor Tyutchev]] is recited. She appears to use [[psychokinesis]] to push three drinking glasses across the table, one falling off. A train passes by where the Stalker's family lives, and the entire apartment shakes.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Alexander Kaidanovsky]] as the Stalker\n* [[Anatoly Solonitsyn]] as the Writer\n* [[Alisa Freindlich]] as the Stalker's wife\n* [[Nikolai Grinko]] as the Professor (voiced by [[Sergei Yakovlev (actor)|Sergei Yakovlev]])\n* Natasha Abramova as Martyshka, the Stalker's daughter\n* [[Faime Jurno]] as the Writer's interlocutress\n* Evgeniy Kostin as Lyuger, owner of the bar-caf\u00e9 (credited as E.

[and] somewhat futile\".<ref name=\"slant\" />\n\nSeveral critics have identified the nature of human desire as a central theme of the film. James Berardinelli interprets the film as suggesting that \"one's innermost desire may not be what one thinks it is and that one may be better off not achieving it\",<ref>{{cite web |last=Berardinelli |first=James |date=April 27, 2019 |title=Stalker (USSR, 1979) |url=https://www.reelviews.net/reelviews/stalker |access-date=February 6, 2021 |website=ReelViews}}</ref> while Schager describes the film as capturing \"the essence of what man is made of... a yearning for something that's simultaneously beyond our reach and yet intrinsic to every one of us\".<ref name=\"slant\" />\n\n[[Geoff Dyer]] argues the Stalker is \"seeking asylum from the world\", and says that \"while the film may not be about the [[gulag]], it is haunted by memories of the camps, from the overlap of vocabulary (\"Zona\", \"the meat grinder\") to the Stalker's Zek-style shaved head\".<ref name=\"the-guardian\">{{Cite web|last=Dyer|first=Geoff|date=February 5, 2009|title=Danger!

The themes of nuclear radiation and environmental degradation would be revisited by Tarkovsky in his final film, ''[[The Sacrifice (1986 film)|The Sacrifice]]''.\n\nMidway in the film, the Stalker has an interior monologue in which he quotes the entire section 76 of Lao Tse's [[Tao Te Ching]], the text of which characterizes softness and pliancy as qualities of a newborn, hence, new life; hardness and strength, on the contrary, are qualities nearing death. (\"Man, when he enters life, is soft and weak. When he dies he is hard and strong.\")<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wilhelm|first=Richard|title=Tao Te Ching|publisher=Routledge, Kegan Paul Ltd|year=1985|isbn=1-85063-011-9|location=London|pages=62}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n=== Writing ===\nAfter reading the novel ''[[Roadside Picnic]]'', by [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]], Tarkovsky initially recommended it to a friend, the film director [[Mikhail Kalatozov]], thinking Kalatozov might be interested in adapting it into a film. Kalatozov abandoned the project when he could not obtain the rights to the novel. Tarkovsky then became very interested in adapting the novel and expanding its concepts. He hoped it would allow him to make a film which conformed to the [[Classical unities|classical Aristotelian unity]]; a single action, on a single location, within 24 hours (single point in time).<ref name=\"toninoguerra\" />\n\nTarkovsky viewed the idea of the Zone as a dramatic tool to draw out the personalities of the three protagonists, particularly the psychological damage from everything that happens to the [[Idealism|idealistic]] views of the Stalker as he finds himself unable to make others happy: <blockquote>\"This, too, is what Stalker is about: the hero goes through moments of despair when his faith is shaken; but every time he comes to a renewed sense of his vocation to serve people who have lost their hopes and illusions.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Sculpting in Time.

According to an interview with Tarkovsky in 1979, the film has basically nothing in common with the novel except for the two words \"Stalker\" and \"Zone\".<ref name=\"toninoguerra\" />\n\nYet, several similarities remain between the novel and the film. In both works, the Zone is guarded by a police or military guard, apparently authorized to use [[deadly force]]. The Stalker in both works tests the safety of his path by tossing nuts and bolts tied with scraps of cloth, verifying that gravity is working as usual. A character named Porcupine is a mentor to Stalker. In the novel, frequent visits to the Zone increase the likelihood of abnormalities in the visitor's offspring. In the book, the Stalker's daughter has light hair all over her body, while in the film she is crippled and has psychokinetic abilities. The 'meat grinder', a particularly perilous location, is mentioned in both film and the book. Neither in the novel nor in the film do the women enter the Zone \u2014 indeed, the film features a female character who is introduced as wishing to enter the Zone, but who is dismissed by the Stalker prior to departure. Finally, the target of the expedition in both works is a wish-granting device.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}\n\nIn ''Roadside Picnic'', the site was specifically described as the site of alien visitation; the name of the novel derives from a metaphor proposed by a character who compares the visit to a roadside picnic. The closing monologue by the Stalker's wife at the end of the film has no equivalent in the novel. An early draft of the screenplay was published as a novel ''[[Stalker (novel)|Stalker]]'' that differs substantially from the finished film.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}\n\n=== Production ===\nIn an interview on the MK2 DVD, the production designer, Rashit Safiullin, recalled that Tarkovsky spent a year shooting all the outdoor scenes. However, when the crew returned to [[Moscow]], they found that the film had been improperly developed and their footage was unusable. The film had been shot on new [[Kodak]] 5247 stock with which Soviet laboratories were not very familiar.<ref name=rusico /> Even before the film stock problem was discovered, relations between Tarkovsky and ''Stalker''{{'}}s first [[cinematographer]], [[Georgy Rerberg]], had deteriorated. After seeing the poorly developed material, Tarkovsky fired Rerberg. Safiullin contends that Tarkovsky was so despondent at having to discard all the outdoor work that he wanted to abandon further work on the film.<ref name=rusico />\n\nAfter the loss of the film stock, the Soviet film boards wanted to shut the film down, but Tarkovsky came up with a solution: he asked to be allowed to make a two-part film, which meant additional deadlines and more funds. Tarkovsky ended up reshooting almost all of the film with a new cinematographer, [[Alexander Knyazhinsky]]. According to Safiullin, the finished version of ''Stalker'' is completely different from the one Tarkovsky originally shot.<ref name=rusico />\n\nThe documentary film ''Rerberg and Tarkovsky: The Reverse Side of \"Stalker\"'' by Igor Mayboroda offers a different interpretation of the relationship between Rerberg and Tarkovsky. Rerberg felt that Tarkovsky was not ready for this script. He told Tarkovsky to rewrite the script in order to achieve a good result. Tarkovsky ignored him and continued shooting. After several arguments, Tarkovsky sent Rerberg home. Ultimately, Tarkovsky shot ''Stalker'' three times, consuming over {{convert|5000|m}} of film. People who have seen both the first version shot by Rerberg (as Director of Photography) and the final theatrical release say that they are almost identical. Tarkovsky sent home other crew members in addition to Rerberg, excluding them from the credits, as well.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}\n\n{{stack|[[File:J\u00e4gala HEP, Sept 2009.jpg|thumb|One of the deserted hydro power plants near [[Tallinn]], Estonia, where the central part of ''Stalker'' was shot.]]}}\nThe central part of the film, in which the characters travel within the Zone, was shot in a few days at two deserted [[hydropower|hydro power plants]] on the [[J\u00e4gala (river)|J\u00e4gala river]] near [[Tallinn]], [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonia]].<ref name=\"norton\">{{Citation |last=Norton |first=James |title=Stalking the Stalker |url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Norton.html |publisher=Nostalghia.com |access-date=2010-09-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316214005/https://people.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Norton.html |archive-date=2018-03-16}}</ref> The shot before they enter the Zone is an old Flora chemical factory in the center of [[Tallinn]], next to the old Rotermann salt storage (now [[Museum of Estonian Architecture]]), and the former [[Tallinn Power Plant]], now [[Kultuurikatel|Tallinn Creative Hub]], where a memorial plate of the film was set up in 2008.

Sound designer Vladimir Sharun recalled:\n{{quote|\"We were shooting near Tallinn in the area around the small river J\u00e4gala with a half-functioning hydroelectric station. Up the river was a chemical plant and it poured out poisonous liquids downstream. There is even this shot in Stalker: snow falling in the summer and white foam floating down the river. In fact it was some horrible poison. Many women in our crew got allergic reactions on their faces. Tarkovsky died from cancer of the right bronchial tube. And Tolya Solonitsyn too.

For ''Stalker'', Artemyev composed and recorded two different versions of the score. The first score was done with an orchestra alone but was rejected by Tarkovsky. The second score that was used in the final film was created on a synthesizer along with traditional instruments that were manipulated using sound effects.<ref>{{citation |last=Johnson |first=Vida T. |author2=Graham Petrie |title=The Films of Andrei Tarkovsky: A Visual Fugue |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1994 |page=57 |isbn=0-253-20887-4}}</ref>\n\nIn the final film score, the boundaries between music and sound were blurred, as natural sounds and music interact to the point where they are indistinguishable.

He believed that music distorts and changes the emotional tone of a visual image while not changing the meaning. He also believed that in a film with complete theoretical consistency music will have no place and that instead music is replaced by sounds. According to Tarkovsky, he aimed at this consistency and moved into this direction in ''Stalker'' and ''[[Nostalghia]]''.<ref>{{citation |last=Tarkovsky |first=Andrei |others=translated by Kitty Hunter-Blair |title=Sculpting in Time |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1987 |pages=158\u2013159 |isbn=0-292-77624-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u-HRWkL6vnAC}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the original monophonic soundtrack, the Russian Cinema Council (Ruscico) created an alternative [[Surround sound|5.1 surround sound]] track for the 2001 DVD release.<ref name=rusico /> In addition to remixing the mono soundtrack, music and sound effects were removed and added in several scenes. Music was added to the scene where the three are traveling to the Zone on a motorized [[draisine]]. In the opening and the final scene [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] ''[[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]]'' was removed and in the opening scene in Stalker's house ambient sounds were added, changing the original soundtrack, in which this scene was completely silent except for the sound of a train.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/newsStalker_RusCiCo.html|title=The RusCiCo Stalker DVD|last=Bielawski|first=Jan |author2=Trond S.

Even after he had shot all the material he continued his search for the ideal film score, wanting a combination of Oriental and Western music. In a conversation with Artemyev he explained that he needed music that reflects the idea that although the East and the West can coexist, they are not able to understand each other.<ref name=\"electroshock\">{{citation|url=http://www.electroshock.ru/eng/edward/interview/egorova/|title=Edward Artemiev: He has been and will always remain a creator\u2026|last=Egorova|first=Tatyana|publisher=Electroshock Records|access-date=2009-06-07}}, (originally published in ''Muzikalnaya zhizn'', Vol. 17, 1988)</ref> One of Tarkovsky's ideas was to perform Western music on Oriental instruments (or vice versa).

Later, Tarkovsky proposed to invite musicians from [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan]] and to let them improvise on the melody of the motet. A musician was invited from Azerbaijan who played the main melody on a [[Tar (string instrument)|tar]] based on [[mugham]], accompanied by orchestral background music written by Artemyev.<ref>{{cite web|title=August 26 \u2013 International Day of Azerbaijani Mugham|url=http://www.today.az/news/entertainment/93230.html|website=www.today.az|access-date=15 August 2014}}</ref> Tarkovsky, who, unusually for him, attended the full recording session, rejected the final result as not what he was looking for.<ref name=\"electroshock\" />\n\nRethinking their approach, they finally found the solution in a theme that would create a state of inner calmness and inner satisfaction, or as Tarkovsky said \"space frozen in a dynamic equilibrium\". Artemyev knew about a musical piece from [[Indian classical music]] where a prolonged and unchanged background tone is performed on a [[tanpura]]. As this gave Artemyev the impression of frozen space, he used this inspiration and created a background tone on his synthesizer similar to the background tone performed on the tanpura. The tar then improvised on the background sound, together with a [[Western concert flute|flute]] as a European, Western instrument.<ref name=\"turovskaya\">{{citation|last=Turovskaya|first=Maya|title=7\u00bd, ili filmy Andreya Tarkovskovo |publisher=Iskusstvo |location=Moscow |year=1991 |isbn=5-210-00279-9|url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Stalker/artemyev.html|access-date=2009-06-07 |language=ru}}</ref> To mask the obvious combination of European and Oriental instruments he passed the foreground music through the effect channels of his [[EMS Synthi 100|SYNTHI 100]] synthesizer. These effects included modulating the sound of the flute and lowering the speed of the tar, so that what Artemyev called \"the life of one string\" could be heard. Tarkovsky was amazed by the result, especially liking the sound of the tar, and used the theme without any alterations in the film.<ref name=\"electroshock\" />\n\n=== Sound design ===\nThe title sequence is accompanied by Artemyev's main theme. The opening sequence of the film showing Stalker's room is mostly silent. Periodically one hears what could be a train. The sound becomes louder and clearer over time until the sound and the vibrations of objects in the room give a sense of a train's passing by without the train being visible. This aural impression is quickly subverted by the muffled sound of Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]]. The source of this music is unclear, thus setting the tone for the blurring of reality in the film.<ref name=\"edgeofperception\">{{citation|last=Smith|first=Stefan|date=November 2007|title=The edge of perception: sound in Tarkovsky's Stalker|journal=The Soundtrack|publisher=Intellect Publishing|volume=1|issue=1|pages=41\u201352|doi=10.1386/st.1.1.41_1}}</ref> For this part of the film Tarkovsky was also considering music by [[Richard Wagner]] or the ''[[La Marseillaise|Marseillaise]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}\n\nIn an interview with [[Tonino Guerra]] in 1979, Tarkovsky said that he wanted: <blockquote>\"...music that is more or less popular, that expresses the movement of the masses, the theme of humanity's social destiny...But this music must be barely heard beneath the noise, in a way that the spectator is not aware of it.\"<ref name=\"toninoguerra\" /></blockquote>\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = I would like most of the noise and sound to be composed by a composer. In the film, for example, the three people undertake a long journey in a railway car. I'd like that the noise of the wheels on the rails not be the natural sound but elaborated upon by the composer with electronic music. At the same time, one mustn't be aware of music, nor natural sounds.\n| source = &ndash;Andrei Tarkovsky, interviewed by [[Tonino Guerra]] in 1979.<ref name=\"toninoguerra\" />\n| align = left\n| width = 30%\n| fontsize = 100%\n}}\n\nThe journey into the Zone on a motorized rail car features a disconnection between the visual image and the sound. The presence of the rail car is registered only through the clanking sound of the wheels on the tracks. Neither the rail car nor the scenery passing by is shown, since the camera is focused on the faces of the characters. This disconnection draws the audience into the inner world of the characters and transforms the physical journey into an inner journey. This effect on the audience is reinforced by Artemyev's synthesizer effects, which make the clanking wheels sound less and less natural as the journey progresses. When the three arrive in the Zone initially, it appears to be silent. Only after some time, and only slightly audibly can one hear the sound of a distant river, the sound of the blowing wind, or the occasional cry of an animal. These sounds grow richer and more audible while the Stalker makes his first venture into the Zone, as if the sound draws him towards the Zone. The sparseness of sounds in the Zone draws attention to specific sounds, which, as in other scenes, are largely disconnected from the visual image. Animals can be heard in the distance but are never shown. A breeze can be heard, but no visual reference is shown. This effect is reinforced by occasional synthesizer effects which meld with the natural sounds and blur the boundaries between artificial and alien sounds and the sounds of nature.<ref name=\"edgeofperception\" />\n\nDuring the journey in the Zone, the sound of water becomes more and more prominent, which, combined with the visual image, presents the Zone as a drenched world. In an interview Tarkovsky dismissed the idea that water has a symbolic meaning in his films, saying that there was so much rain in his films because it is always raining in Russia.<ref name=\"edgeofperception\" /> In another interview, on the film ''Nostalghia'', however, he said \"Water is a mysterious element, a single molecule of which is very photogenic. It can convey movement and a sense of change and flux.\"<ref>{{citation|last=Mitchell|first=Tony|date=Winter 1982\u20131983|title=Tarkovsky in Italy|journal=Sight and Sound |publisher=The British Film Institut e|pages=54\u201356 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Tarkovsky_in_Italy.html |access-date=2009-06-13}}</ref> Emerging from the tunnel called the \"meat grinder\" by the Stalker, they arrive at the entrance of their destination, the room. Here, as in the rest of the film, sound is constantly changing and not necessarily connected to the visual image. The journey in the Zone ends with the three sitting in the room, silent, with no audible sound. When the sound resumes, it is again the sound of water but with a different timbre, softer and gentler, as if to give a sense of catharsis and hope. The transition back to the world outside the Zone is supported by sound. While the camera still shows a pool of water inside the Zone, the audience begins to hear the sound of a train and [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s ''[[Bol\u00e9ro]]'', reminiscent of the opening scene. The soundscape of the world outside the Zone is the same as before, characterized by train wheels, foghorns of a ship and train whistles. The film ends as it began, with the sound of a train passing by, accompanied by the muffled sound of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, this time the ''[[Ode to Joy]]'' from the final moments of the symphony. As in the rest of the film the disconnect between the visual image and the sound leaves the audience unclear whether the sound is real or an illusion.<ref name=\"edgeofperception\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Critical response ===\nUpon its release the film's reception was less than favorable. Officials at [[Goskino]], a government group otherwise known as the State Committee for Cinematography, were critical of the film.<ref>Tsymbal E., 2008. ''Tarkovsky, Sculpting the Stalker: Towards a new language of cinema'', London, black dog publishing</ref> On being told that ''Stalker'' should be faster and more dynamic, Tarkovsky replied:{{quote|The film needs to be slower and duller at the start so that the viewers who walked into the wrong theatre have time to leave before the main action starts.}}\n\nThe Goskino representative then stated that he was trying to give the point of view of the audience. Tarkovsky supposedly retorted:\n{{quote|I am only interested in the views of two people: one is called [[Robert Bresson|Bresson]] and one called [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Zona: A Book About a Film About a Journey to a Room |last=Dyer |first=Geoff |date=1987 |publisher=[[Canongate]] |location=[[Edinburgh]] |page=13 |isbn=978-0-85786-167-2|title-link=Zona: A Book About a Film About a Journey to a Room }}</ref>}}\n\nMore recently, reviews of the film have been highly positive.
