Featuring the voices of [[Junko Iwao]], [[Rica Matsumoto]], [[Shiho Niiyama]], Masaaki Okura, Shinpachi Tsuji and Emiko Furukawa, the plot follows a member of a Japanese idol group who retires from music to pursue an acting career. As she becomes a victim of stalking, gruesome murders begin to occur, and she starts to lose her grip on reality.<ref>[https://phasrmedia.com/most-disturbing-horror-movies/ Extreme Cinema: The 40 Most Disturbing Horror Movies Ever Made \u2013 PHASR]</ref>\n\nThe film deals with the blurring of the line between fantasy and reality, a commonly found theme in Kon's later works, such as ''[[Paprika (2006 film)|Paprika]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/15/AR2007061500492.html|title=Satoshi Kon, Anime's Dream Weaver|newspaper=Washington Post|date=June 15, 2007|access-date=October 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214221445/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/15/AR2007061500492.html|archive-date=December 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n\nMima Kirigoe, member of a [[J-pop]] idol group named \"CHAM!\", decides to leave the group to become a full-time actress. She gets stalked by an obsessive fan named Me-Mania, who is upset by her change from a clean-cut image. Following directions from a fan letter, Mima discovers a website called \"Mima's Room\" containing public diary entries written from her perspective, and which has her daily life and thoughts recorded in great detail. During her acting career, she is joined by manager and former pop-idol Rumi Hidaka, and her agent Tadokoro. Mima confides in Rumi about \"Mima's Room\", but is advised to ignore it.\n\nMima's first job is a minor role in a television detective drama called ''Double Bind'', however, Tadokoro lobbies the producers of ''Double Bind'', and succeeds in securing Mima a larger part that involves a rape scene. Despite Rumi's objections, Mima accepts the role, although this leaves her severely affected. On her way home, she sees her reflection dressed in her former idol outfit. The reflection claims she's \"the real Mima\". Between the ongoing stresses of filming ''Double Bind'', her lingering regret over leaving ''CHAM!'', her paranoia of being stalked, and her increasing obsession with \"Mima's Room\", Mima begins to suffer from [[psychosis]]: in particular, struggling to distinguish real life from her work in show business, and having repeated apparently unreal sightings of her former self, \"the real Mima\".\n\nSeveral people who had been involved in her acting are murdered. Mima finds evidence which makes her appear to be the prime suspect, and her mental instability makes her doubt her own memories and innocence, as she recalls brutally murdering photographer Murano. Mima manages to finish shooting ''Double Bind'', the final scene of which reveals that her character killed and assumed the identity of her sister due to trauma-induced [[dissociative identity disorder]]. After the rest of the filming staff have left the studio, Me-Mania, acting on e-mailed instructions from \"the real Mima\" to \"eliminate the impostor\", attempts to rape and kill her, but Mima knocks him unconscious with a hammer.\n\nMima is found backstage by Rumi and taken back to Rumi's home, where she wakes up in a room modelled on Mima's own room, only to discover that Rumi was the culprit behind \"Mima's Room\", the serial murders, and the [[folie \u00e0 deux]] that manipulated and scapegoated Me-Mania. Rumi previously developed a second personality who believed herself to be the \"real Mima\", using information from Mima's confiding in her as the basis for \"Mima's Room\". She also reveals her motives: she is displeased by Mima retiring from the idol industry and hence, seeks to destroy and replace her, in order to 'redeem' her image. At wit's end, Rumi's \"Mima\" personality chases Mima through the city to murder her. Mima incapacitates Rumi with a mirror shard in self-defense but saves her from being killed by an oncoming truck. With that, Mima's hallucinations seem to be over.\n\nSome time later, Mima is now a well-known actress and visits Rumi in a mental institution. Rumi's doctor says that she still believes she is a pop idol most of the time. Mima says she's learned a lot from her experience thanks to Rumi. As Mima leaves the hospital, she overhears two nurses talking about her. They think she is a lookalike, as the real Mima Kirigoe would supposedly have no reason to visit a mental institution. As Mima enters her car, she smiles at herself in the rear-view mirror before declaring, \"No, I'm real.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Character !! Japanese !!
