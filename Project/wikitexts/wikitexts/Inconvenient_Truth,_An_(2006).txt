The film features a [[slide show]] that, by Gore's own estimate, he has presented over 1,000 times to audiences worldwide.\n\nThe idea to document Gore's efforts came from producer [[Laurie David]], who saw his presentation at a [[town hall meeting]] on global warming, which coincided with the opening of ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]''. Laurie David was so inspired by his slide show that she, with producer [[Lawrence Bender]], met with Guggenheim to adapt the presentation into a film. Premiering at the [[2006 Sundance Film Festival]] and opening in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] on May 24, 2006, the documentary was a critical and commercial success, winning two [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]].<ref name=\"nytimes2009_342290\" /> The film grossed $24 million in the U.S. and $26 million at the international [[box office]], becoming the 11th highest grossing documentary film to date in the United States.<ref name=\"mojo-chart\" />\n\nSince the film's release, ''An Inconvenient Truth'' has been credited for raising [[Public opinion on global warming|international public awareness of global warming]] and reenergizing the [[environmental movement]]. The documentary has also been included in science curricula in schools around the world, which has spurred some controversy. A sequel to the film, titled ''[[An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power]]'', was released on July 28, 2017.\n\n==Synopsis {{anchor|Synopsis|Plot}}==\n{{Long plot|date=November 2021}}\n''An Inconvenient Truth'' presents in film form an illustrated talk on climate by Al Gore, aimed at alerting the public to an increasing \"planetary emergency\" due to [[global warming]], and shows re-enacted incidents from his life story which influenced his concerns about environmental issues. He began making these presentations in 1989 with [[flip chart]] illustrations;<ref name=\"revkin-thefight\" /> the film version uses a [[Keynote (presentation software)|Keynote presentation]], which Gore refers to as \"the [[slide show]]\".<ref name=\"r__arstech2006064392\" />\n\nThe former vice president opens the film by greeting an audience with his well-known line about [[Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000|his campaign in 2000]]: \"I am Al Gore. I used to be the next President of the United States.\"<ref name=\"CSMonitor\" /> He is shown using his laptop to edit his presentation, and pondering the difficulty he has had in awakening public concern: \"I've been trying to tell this story for a long time and I feel as if I've failed to get the message across.\"<ref name=\"revkin-thefight\" />\n\nGore then begins his slide show on Global Warming; a comprehensive presentation replete with detailed graphs, flow charts and stark visuals. Gore shows off several photographs of the Earth taken from multiple space missions, as ''[[Earthrise]]'' and ''[[The Blue Marble]]''.<ref name=\"goreplaysleadingman\" /> Gore notes that these photos dramatically transformed the way we see the Earth, helping spark modern [[environmentalism]].\n\nFollowing this, Gore shares anecdotes that inspired his interest in the issue, including his college education with early climate expert [[Roger Revelle]] at [[Harvard University]], his sister's death from lung cancer and his young son's near-fatal car accident. Gore recalls a story from his grade-school years, where a fellow student asked his geography teacher about [[continental drift]], whether the coastlines of South America and Africa might fit together; in response, the teacher called the concept the \"most ridiculous thing [he'd] ever heard.\" Gore ties this conclusion to the assumption that \"the Earth is so big, we can't possibly have any lasting, harmful impact on the Earth's environment.\" For comic effect, Gore uses a clip from the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode \"[[Crimes of the Hot]]\" to describe the [[greenhouse effect]]. Gore refers to his loss to [[George W. Bush]] in the [[2000 United States presidential election]] as a \"hard blow\" yet one which subsequently \"brought into clear focus, the mission [he] had been pursuing for all these years.\"\n\n[[File:PaleBlueDot.jpg|thumb|alt=A tiny, pale blue dot is contrasted against the vastness of space|The [[Pale Blue Dot]], a [[Voyager 1]] photo showing Earth ''(circled)'' as a single pixel from 4 billion miles (6.4 billion kilometres) away, is featured in the film. Al Gore points out that all of human history has happened on that pixel, which is the only planet where life has been discovered.]]\n\nThroughout the movie, Gore discusses the [[scientific opinion on global warming]], as well as the present and future [[effects of global warming]] and stresses that global warming \"is really not a political issue, so much as a moral one,\" describing the consequences he believes global warming will produce if the amount of human-generated [[greenhouse gases]] is not significantly reduced in the very near future. Gore also presents Antarctic [[ice core|ice coring]] data showing CO<sub>2</sub> levels higher now than in the past 650,000 years.\n\nThe film includes segments intended to refute critics who say that global warming is unproven or that warming will be insignificant. For example, Gore cites the [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|retreat of nearly all glaciers]] caused by melting over recent decades, showing nine cases, such as the [[Grinnell Glacier|Grinnel]] and Boulder Glaciers and Patagonia. He discusses the possibility of the collapse and melting of a major [[ice sheet]] in [[Greenland]] or in [[West Antarctica]], either of which could raise global sea levels by approximately 20 feet (6m), flooding coastal areas and producing 100 million refugees. Melt water from Greenland, because of its lower [[salinity]], could then halt the currents that keep northern Europe warm and quickly trigger dramatic local cooling there. It also contains various short animated projections of what could happen to different animals more vulnerable to global warming.\n\nThe documentary ends with Gore arguing that if appropriate actions are taken soon, the effects of global warming can be successfully reversed by releasing less [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] and planting more vegetation to consume existing CO<sub>2</sub>. Gore calls upon his viewers to learn how they can help him in these efforts. Gore closes the film by saying:\n\n{{blockquote|Each one of us is a cause of global warming, but each one of us can make choices to change that with the things we buy, the electricity we use, the cars we drive; we can make choices to bring our individual carbon emissions to zero. The solutions are in our hands, we just have to have the determination to make it happen. We have everything that we need to reduce carbon emissions, everything but political will. But in America, the will to act is a renewable resource.<ref name=\"r__firethemup_92\" />}}\n\nDuring the film's end credits, a [[diorama]] pops up on screen suggesting to viewers things at home they can do to combat global warming, including \"recycle\", \"speak up in your community\", \"try to buy a [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid vehicle]]\" and \"encourage everyone you know to watch this movie.\"<ref name=\"r__eogwacc2008_p58\" />\n\nGore's [[An Inconvenient Truth (book)|book of the same title]] was published concurrently with the theatrical release of the documentary. The book contains additional information, scientific analysis, and Gore's commentary on the issues presented in the documentary.<ref name=\"r__nytimes20060523\" /><ref name=\"r__nybooks20060713\" /> A 2007 documentary entitled ''An Update with Former Vice President Al Gore'' features Gore discussing additional information that came to light after the film was completed, such as [[Hurricane Katrina]], [[coral reef]] depletion, glacial earthquake activity on the [[Greenland ice sheet]], [[wildfires]], and trapped methane gas release associated with [[permafrost]] melting.<ref name=\"algoreupdate\" />\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Al Gore at SapphireNow 2010.jpg|thumb|270px|alt=A serious man dressed in a suit gestures|Gore gives a keynote address on sustainability at SapphireNow 2010 in May 2010]]\n\n=== Origins ===\n{{See also|Environmental activism of Al Gore}}\nGore became interested in global warming when he took a course at [[Harvard University]] with Professor [[Roger Revelle]], one of the first scientists to measure [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere.<ref name=\"r__sundance20060126\" /> \nLater, when Gore was in Congress, he initiated the first congressional hearing on the subject in 1981.<ref name=\"r__thenewyorker20060414\" /> Gore's 1992 book, ''[[Earth in the Balance]]'', dealing with a number of environmental topics, reached the [[The New York Times Best Seller List|''New York Times'' bestseller list]].<ref name=\"biosen\" />\n\nAs Vice President during the [[Clinton Administration]], Gore pushed for the implementation of a [[carbon tax]] to encourage [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and diversify the choices of fuel better reflecting the true environmental costs of [[energy use]]; it was partially implemented in 1993.<ref name=\"r__washingtonpost72174989\" />\n\nHe helped broker the 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]], an international treaty designed to curb [[greenhouse gas emissions]].<ref name=\"kyotospeech\" /><ref name=\"environinitiative\" /> The treaty was not ratified in the United States after a 95 to 0 vote in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. The primary objections stemmed from the exemptions the treaty gave to China and India, whose [[Industrial sector|industrial base]] and [[carbon footprint]] have grown rapidly, and fears that the exemptions would lead to further trade imbalances and offshoring arrangement with those countries.<ref name=\"r__ussenate19970725\" /><ref name=\"r__nationalcenter19970725\" />\n\nGore also supported the funding of the controversial, and much-delayed satellite called [[Triana (satellite)|Triana]], which would have provided an image of the Earth 24 hours a day, over the internet and would have acted as a barometer measuring the process of global warming.<ref name=\"r__nytimes19990601\" /> During [[Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000|his 2000 presidential campaign]], Gore ran, in part, on a pledge to ratify the Kyoto Protocol.<ref name=\"r__ontheissues_kyototreaty\" />\n\n=== The slide show ===\n[[File:Al gore presentation.jpg|thumb|alt=A man is standing on a stage in front of a giant projection of the Earth|Gore presents his global warming slide show at the [[University of Miami]]]]\n\nAfter his defeat in [[2000 United States presidential election|the 2000 presidential election]] by [[George W. Bush]], Gore returned his focus to the topic. He edited and adapted a slide show he had compiled years earlier, and began featuring the slide show in presentations on global warming across the U.S. and around the world. At the time of the film, Gore estimated he had shown the presentation more than one thousand times.<ref name=\"r__wiredmag200605\" />\n\nProducer Laurie David saw Gore's slide show in [[New York City]] at a global warming town-hall meeting after the May 27, 2004 premiere of ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]''.<ref name=\"goreleadingman\" /> Gore was one of several panelists and he showed a ten-minute version of his slide show.\n<ref name=\"r__npr20070507\" />\n\n{{blockquote|I had never seen it before, and I was floored. As soon as the evening's program concluded, I asked him to let me present his full briefing to leaders and friends in New York and Los Angeles. I would do all the organizing if he would commit to the dates. Gore's presentation was the most powerful and clear explanation of global warming I had ever seen. And it became my mission to get everyone I knew to see it too.}}\n\nInspired, David assembled a team, including producer Lawrence Bender and former president of [[eBay]] [[Jeffrey Skoll]], who met with Gore about the possibility of making the slide show into a movie. It took some convincing. The slide show, she says, \"was his baby, and he felt proprietary about it and it was hard for him to let go.\"<ref name=\"goreleadingman\" />\n\nDavid said the box office returns weren't important to her, and that what was at stake was the planet, saying \"none of us are going to make a dime.\"<ref name=\"goreleadingman\" />\n\nDavid and Bender later met with director Davis Guggenheim, to have him direct the film adaptation of his slide show. Guggenheim, who was skeptical at first, later saw the presentation for himself, stating that he was \"blown away,\" and \"left after an hour and a half thinking that global warming [was] the most important issue ... I had no idea how you'd make a film out of it, but I wanted to try,\" he said.<ref name=\"r__worldchanging004388\" />\n\nIn 2004 Gore enlisted Duarte Design to condense and update his material and add video and animation.<ref name=\"r__latime20080915\" /> Ted Boda described the tools that went into designing the project: \"Gore's presentation was in fact using Apple's [[Keynote (presentation software)|Keynote]] presentation software (the same software [[Steve Jobs]] presents from) and did so for a number of reasons. As a designer for the presentation, Keynote was the first choice to help create such an engaging presentation.\"<ref name=\"r__presentationzen20060601\" />\n\nInitially reluctant of the film adaptation, Gore said after he and the crew were into the production of the movie, the director, Guggenheim, earned his trust.<ref name=\"accidental-movie-star\" />\n\n{{blockquote|I had seen enough to gain a tremendous respect for his skill and sensitivity. And he said that one of the huge differences between a live stage performance and a movie is that when you're in the same room with a live person who's on stage speaking \u2014 even if it's me \u2014 there's an element of dramatic tension and human connection that keeps your attention. And in a movie, that element is just not present. He explained to me that you have to create that element on screen, by supplying a narrative thread that allows the audience to make a connection with one or more characters. He said, \"You've got to be that character.\" So we talked about it, and as I say, by then he had earned such a high level of trust from me that he convinced me.}}\n\n=== Production ===\n\nWhen Bender first saw Gore's visual presentation he had concerns about connection with viewers, citing a \"need to find a personal way in.\" In the string of interviews with Gore that followed, Gore himself felt like they \"were making ''Kill Al Vol. 3''\".<ref name=\"lawrencebendertruthdig\" /> Bender had other issues including a time frame that was \"grueling\" and needed to be done in \"a very short period of time\" despite many filming locations planned. These included many locations throughout the United States and also included China. \"It was a lot of travel in a very short period of time. And they had to get this thing edited and cut starting in January, and ready to screen in May. That's like a seriously tight schedule. So the logistics of pulling it off with a low budget were really difficult, and if there's one person who gets credit, it's Leslie Chilcott, because she really pulled it together.\"<ref name=\"lawrencebendertruthdig\" />\n\n\"Most of my movies take a year and a half, if not two and a half,\" Guggenheim said. \"We all felt like we were on a mission from God just to make it as fast as we could. We just felt like it was urgent. The clock was ticking, and people had to see it.\"<ref name=\"grist2016\" />\n\n====Title====\n\nThe producers struggled to find an effective title for the film. \"We had a lot of really bad titles,\" Guggenheim recalled. \"One was ''The Rising''. I remember Al talking about whether he should give [[Bruce Springsteen]] a call, because he had an album out called ''[[The Rising (album)|The Rising]]''. It had a great triple-entendre, because it was like the sea-level rising and the idea of people rising. So we got excited about that for a while.\"<ref name=\"grist2016\"/> \"There were also some really bad ones like ''Too Hot to Handle,''\" he added. \"Maybe that's not right, but it was something with 'hot,' ya know? We had a lot of hot puns.\"<ref name=\"grist2016\"/>\n\nGuggenheim remembers asking Gore why climate change was \"so hard for people to grasp.\" To which Gore replied, \"Because it's an inconvenient truth, ya know.\" \"[...] In the back of my head, I go, that's the title of our movie,\" Guggenheim said.\n\nInitially, the title was not a popular choice, even Gore remembers saying \"Nah, I don't think so\" but Guggenheim \"defended it vigorously against other titles.\" \"People thought it was hard to say, people thought it wasn't fun, it wasn't sexy,\" Guggenheim remembered. \"Days before we went to Sundance and had to decide, there was a large group of people who did not like the title.\"<ref name=\"grist2016\"/>\n\n====Technical aspects====\n\nThe majority of the movie exhibits Gore delivering his lecture to an audience at a relatively small theater in Los Angeles. Gore's presentation was delivered on a 70-foot (21 m) digital screen that Bender commissioned specifically for the movie.<ref name=\"lawrencebendertruthdig\" />\n\nWhile the bulk of the film was shot on 4:4:4 [[HDCAM]], according to director Guggenheim, a vast array of different film formats were used: \"There's [[35mm movie film|35mm]] and [[16mm]]. A lot of the stuff on the farm I just shot myself on [[8mm film]]. We used four [[Sony F950]] HDCAMs for the presentation. We shot three different kinds of [[wikt:prosumer#Etymology 2|prosumer]] HD, both 30 and 24. There's MiniDV, there's 3200 black-and-white stills, there's digital stills, some of them emailed on the day they were taken from as far off as Greenland. There was three or four different types of animation. One of the animators is from New Zealand and emailed me his work. There's JPEG stuff.\"<ref name=\"sheddinglight\" />\n\nGuggenheim says while it would've been a lot easier to use one format, it would not have had the same impact. \"Each format has its own feel and texture and touch. For the storytelling of what Gore's memory was like of growing up on the farm, some of this 8mm stuff that I shot is very impressionistic. And for some of his memories of his son's accident, these grainy black-and-white stills ... have a feel that contrasted very beautifully with the crisp hi-def HD that we shot. Every format was used to its best potential. Some of the footage of Katrina has this blown-out video, where the [[wikt:chroma|chroma]] is just blasted, and it looks real muddy, but that too has its own kind of powerful, impactful feeling.\"<ref name=\"sheddinglight\" />\n\n==Scientific basis==\n[[File:Mauna Loa CO2 monthly mean concentration.svg|thumbnail|right|300px|alt=A graph shows carbon dioxide concentrations steadily increasing in the atmosphere, from about 315 ppm in 1958 to about 395 ppm in 2013.|Gore presents the [[Keeling curve]], which shows a pattern of steadily increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since 1958.]]\nThe film's thesis is that global warming is real, potentially catastrophic, and [[attribution of recent climate change|human-caused]]. Gore presents specific\ndata to support this thesis, including:\n* The [[Keeling curve]], which depicts the long-term increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration as measured from the [[Mauna Loa Observatory]].\n* The [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|retreat of numerous glaciers]] is shown with before-and-after photographs.\n* A study by researchers at the Physics Institute of the [[University of Bern]] and the [[European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica]] (EPICA) presenting data from Antarctic [[ice cores]] showing carbon dioxide concentrations higher than at any time during the past 650,000 years.<ref name=\"r__sciencejnl_v310_i5752_p1313_1317\" /> \n* Data from the atmospheric [[instrumental temperature record]] showing that the ten hottest years ever measured had all occurred in the previous fourteen years.\n* A 2004 survey by [[Naomi Oreskes]] of 928 peer-reviewed scientific articles on global climate change published between 1993 and 2003. The survey, published as an editorial in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', found that every article either supported the human-caused global warming consensus or did not comment on it.<ref name=\"r__sciencejnl_v306_i5702_p1686\" /> Gore also presents a 2004 study by Max and [[Jules Boykoff]] showing 53% of articles that appeared in major US newspapers over a fourteen-year period gave roughly equal attention to scientists who expressed views that global warming was caused by humans as they did to [[climate change deniers]] (many of them funded by carbon-based industry interests), creating a [[false balance]].<ref name=\"r__fairorg200411_p1978\" /> \nThe [[Associated Press]] contacted more than 100 climate researchers and questioned them about the film's veracity. All 19 climate scientists who had seen the movie or had read the [[An Inconvenient Truth (book)|homonymous book]] said that Gore accurately conveyed the science, with few errors.<ref name=\"scientistsokmovieforaccuracy\" />\n\n[[William H. Schlesinger]], dean of the Nicholas School of Environment and Earth Sciences at [[Duke University]], said \"[Gore] got all the important material and got it right.\" [[Robert Corell]], chairman of the [[Arctic Climate Impact Assessment]], was also impressed. \"I sat there and I'm amazed at how thorough and accurate. After the presentation I said, 'Al, I'm absolutely blown away. There's a lot of details you could get wrong.'...I could find no error.\"<ref name=\"scientistsokmovieforaccuracy\" /> [[Michael Shermer]], scientific author and founder of [[The Skeptics Society]], wrote in ''[[Scientific American]]'' that Gore's slide show \"shocked me out of my doubting stance.\"<ref name=\"r__sciam200606\" /> Eric Steig, a climate scientist writing on [[RealClimate]], lauded the film's science as \"remarkably up to date, with reference to some of the very latest research.\"<ref name=\"gore-steig\" /> \nTed Scambos, lead scientist from the [[National Snow and Ice Data Center]], said the film \"does an excellent job of outlining the science behind global warming and the challenges society faces in the coming century because of it.\"<ref name=\"r__nsidc20100403\" />\n\nOne concern among scientists in the film was the [[Tropical cyclones and climate change|connection between hurricanes and global warming]], which at the time was contentious in the scientific community. Gore cited five recent scientific studies to support his view.<ref name=\"scientistsokmovieforaccuracy\" /> \"I thought the use of imagery from [[Hurricane Katrina]] was inappropriate and unnecessary in this regard, as there are plenty of disturbing impacts associated with global warming for which there is much greater scientific consensus,\" said Brian Soden, professor of meteorology and oceanography at the University of Miami.<ref name=\"scientistsokmovieforaccuracy\" />\n[[Gavin Schmidt]], climate modeler for NASA, thought Gore appropriately addressed the issue.<ref name=\"did-al-get-the-science-right\" /> \"Gore talked about 2005 and 2004 being very strong seasons, and if you weren't paying attention, you could be left with the impression that there was a direct cause and effect, but he was very careful to not say there's a direct correlation,\" Schmidt said.<ref name=\"did-al-get-the-science-right\" /> \"There is a difference between saying 'we are confident that they will increase' and 'we are confident that they have increased due to this effect,'\" added Steig. \"Never in the movie does he say: 'This particular event is caused by global warming.'\"<ref name=\"did-al-get-the-science-right\" />\n\n[[File:Co2-temperature-records.svg|thumb|300px|[[EPICA]] and [[Vostok Station|Vostok]] ice cores display the relationship between temperature and level of CO<sub>2</sub> for the last 650,000 years. (\"Current CO<sub>2</sub> level\" is as of 2006.)]]\nGore's use of long ice core records of CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature (from oxygen isotope measurements) in Antarctic ice cores to illustrate the correlation between the two drew some scrutiny; Schmidt, Steig and [[Michael E. Mann]] back up Gore's data. \"Gore stated that the greenhouse gas levels and temperature changes over ice age signals had a complex relationship but that they 'fit'. Both of these statements are true,\" said Schmidt and Mann.<ref name=\"convenient-untruths\" /> \"The complexity though is actually quite fascinating ... a full understanding of why CO<sub>2</sub> changes in precisely the pattern that it does during ice ages is elusive, but among the most plausible explanations is that increased received [[solar radiation]] in the southern hemisphere due to changes in Earth's orbital geometry warms the southern ocean, releasing CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere, which then leads to further warming through an enhanced greenhouse effect. Gore's terse explanation does not delve into such complexities, but the crux of his point\u2014that the observed long-term relationship between CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature in Antarctica supports our understanding of the warming impact of increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations\u2014is correct. Moreover, our knowledge of why CO<sub>2</sub> is changing now (fossil fuel burning) is solid. We also know that CO<sub>2</sub> is a greenhouse gas, and that the [[carbon cycle]] feedback is positive (increasing temperatures lead to increasing CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>), implying that future changes in CO<sub>2</sub> will be larger than we might anticipate.\"<ref name=\"convenient-untruths\" /> \"Gore is careful not to state what the temperature/CO<sub>2</sub> scaling is,\" said Steig. \"He is making a qualitative point, which is entirely accurate. The fact is that it would be difficult or impossible to explain past changes in temperature during the ice age cycles without CO<sub>2</sub> changes. In that sense, the ice core CO<sub>2</sub>-temperature correlation remains an appropriate demonstration of the influence of CO<sub>2</sub> on climate.\"<ref name=\"gore-steig\" />\n\nSteig disputed Gore's statement that you can visibly see the effect that the [[United States Clean Air Act]] has had on ice cores in Antarctica. \"One can neither see, nor even detect using sensitive chemical methods any evidence in Antarctica of the Clean Air Act,\" he said, but did note that they are \"clearly recorded in ice core records from Greenland.\"<ref name=\"another-look\" /> Despite these flaws, Steig said that the film got the fundamental science right and the minor factual errors did not undermine the main message of the film,<ref name=\"another-look\" /> adding \"''An Inconvenient Truth'' rests on a solid scientific foundation.\"<ref name=\"another-look\" />\n\n[[Lonnie Thompson]], Earth Science professor at [[Ohio State University]], whose work on retreating glaciers was featured in the film, was pleased with how his research was presented. \"It's so hard given the breadth of this topic to be factually correct, and make sure you don't lose your audience,\" Thompson said. \"As scientists, we publish our papers in ''Science'' and ''Nature'', but very few people read those. Here's another way to get this message out. To me, it's an excellent overview for an introductory class at a university.

Hansen said that \"Gore has put together a coherent account of a complex topic that Americans desperately need to understand. The story is scientifically accurate and yet should be understandable to the public, a public that is less and less drawn to science.\" He added that with ''An Inconvenient Truth'', \"Al Gore may have done for global warming what ''[[Silent Spring]]'' did for pesticides.

These explicit attempts to frame the issue as apolitical take on further gravitas when we consider how Gore infused the film with reflections of conservative values. Indeed, Gore reached deeply into the value structure of American conservatives to highlight ideals that suggested his cause was not liberal, but rather was beyond politics, beyond ideology.\"<ref name=\"poff\"/>\n\n===Critical response===\nA small number of reviews criticized the film on scientific and political grounds. Journalist [[Ronald Bailey]] argued in the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] magazine ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' that although \"Gore gets [the science] more right than wrong,\" he exaggerates the risks.<ref name=\"r__reason_rb061606\" /> [[MIT]] atmospheric physicist [[Richard Lindzen|Richard S.

''[[The Boston Globe]]'' writer Peter Canellos criticized the \"gauzy biographical material that seems to have been culled from old Gore campaign commercials.\"<ref name=\"r__bostonglobe20060626\" /> \n[[Phil Hall (US writer)|Phil Hall]] of ''[[Film Threat]]'' gave the film a negative review, saying \"''An Inconvenient Truth'' is something you rarely see in movies today: a blatant intellectual fraud.\"<ref name=\"r__filmthreat_rev8451\" />\n\nOthers felt that Gore did not go far enough in depicting the threat [[Indigenous peoples]] faced with the dire consequences of climate change. \"''An Inconvenient Truth'' completely ignores the plight of Arctic indigenous peoples whose cultures and landscapes are facing profound changes produced by melting polar ice,\" argued environmental historian Finis Dunaway.<ref name=\"r__seeinggreen_2015_9780226169903\" />\n\n==Accolades {{anchor|Awards}}==\n''An Inconvenient Truth'' has received many different awards worldwide.

Three out of four (74%) said they had changed some of their habits because of seeing the film.<ref name=\"globalsurvey\"/>\n\n===Governmental reactions===\nThen-President George W. Bush, when asked whether he would watch the film, responded: \"Doubt it.\" \"New technologies will change how we live and how we drive our cars, which all will have the beneficial effect of improving the environment,\" Bush said. \"And in my judgment we need to set aside whether or not greenhouse gases have been caused by mankind or because of natural effects and focus on the technologies that will enable us to live better lives and at the same time protect the environment\". Gore responded that \"The entire global scientific community has a consensus on the question that human beings are responsible for global warming and he [Bush] has today again expressed personal doubt that that is true.\" White House deputy press secretary [[Dana Perino]] stated that \"The president noted in 2001 the increase in temperatures over the past 100 years and that the increase in greenhouse gases was due to a certain extent to human activity\".<ref name=\"APBush\" />\n\n[[United States Senate|Several United States Senators]] screened the film.

The judge said that showing the film without the explanations of error would be a violation of education laws.<ref name=\"BBC\" />\n\nThe judge concluded \"I have no doubt that Dr Stott, the Defendant's expert, is right when he says that: 'Al Gore's presentation of the causes and likely [[effects of climate change]] in the film was broadly accurate.'\" On the basis of testimony from [[Robert M.

Producer David provided an email correspondence from the NSTA detailing that their reasoning was that the DVDs would place \"unnecessary risk upon the [NSTA] capital campaign, especially certain targeted supporters,\" and that they saw \"little, if any, benefit to NSTA or its members\" in accepting the free DVDs.<ref name=\"r__huffpost20061012\" /> In public, the NSTA argued that distributing this film to its members would have been contrary to a long-standing NSTA policy against distributing unsolicited materials to its members. The NSTA also said that they had offered several other options for distributing the film but ultimately \"[it] appears that these alternative distribution mechanisms were unsatisfactory.\"<ref name=\"r__nsta20061128_52977\" />\n\nDavid has said that NSTA Executive Director Gerry Wheeler promised in a telephone conversation to explore alternatives with NSTA's board for advertising the film but she had not yet received an alternative offer at the time of NSTA's public claim. She also said that she rejected their subsequent offers because they were nothing more than offers to sell their \"commercially available member mailing list\" and advertising space in their magazine and newsletter, which are available to anyone.<ref name=\"crooked\" /> The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] publication ''ScienceNOW'' published an assessment discussing both sides of the NSTA decision in which it was reported that \"David says NSTA's imprimatur [i.e. endorsement or sanction] was essential and that buying a mailing list is a nonstarter. 'You don't want to send out a cold letter, and it costs a lot of money,' she says. 'There are a thousand reasons why that wouldn't work.'\"<ref name=\"r__sciencenews20061130_2006_1130_3\" />\n\nA ''[[The Washington Post]]'' editorial called the decision \"Science ''a la'' [[Joe Camel]]\", citing for example that the NSTA had received $6 million since 1996 from [[Exxon Mobil]], which had a representative on the organization's corporate board.<ref name=\"r__washingtonpost20061124_00789\" /> David noted that in the past, NSTA had shipped out 20,000 copies of a 10-part video produced by Wheeler with funding provided by [[ConocoPhillips]] in 2003.

The petition was in response to concerned parents who talked with Newman after ''An Inconvenient Truth'' was shown in schools in 2007. The parents were apparently worried that teachers were not pointing out supposed inaccuracies in the film and were not explaining differing viewpoints.<ref name=\"r__dompostnz20100422\" />\n\n== Music ==\n{{Infobox album|\n| name       = An Inconvenient Truth: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Michael Brook]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|2006|9|26}}\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 44:43\n| label      = High Wire Music\n| producer   = [[Michael Brook]]\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"r__allmusic_r856432\" /> \n}}\n\n''An Inconvenient Truth'' was [[Film score|scored]] by [[Michael Brook]] with an accompanying theme song played during the end credits by [[Melissa Etheridge]]. Brook explained that he wanted to bring out the emotion expressed in the film: \"... in An Inconvenient Truth, there's a lot of information and it's kind of a lecture, in a way, and very well organized and very well presented, but it's a lot to absorb. And the director, Guggenheim, wanted to have \u2013 sort of give people a little break every once in a while and say, okay, you don't have to absorb this information, you can just sort of \u2013 and it was more the personal side of Al Gore's life or how it connected to the theme of the film. And that's when there's music.\"<ref name=\"michaelbrooknpr\" />\n\nEtheridge agreed to write ''An Inconvenient Truth''{{'s}} theme song, \"[[I Need to Wake Up]]\" after viewing Gore's slide show.<ref name=\"melissaetheridgelatimes\" /> \"I was so honored he would ask me to contribute to a project that is so powerful and so important, I felt such a huge responsibility,\" she said. \"Then I went, 'What am I going to write?
