It was written by Neal Jimenez. The film is a semi-[[autobiographical]] story about a young [[Narrative|fiction writer]] who becomes [[Tetraplegia|tetraplegic fully paralyzed]] in a [[hiking]] accident and works to rehabilitate his body and mind at a [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation center]]. \n\nThe title refers to a dream recounted by Raymond Hill, Snipes's character, about dancing on the surface of a lake. Since, in Raymond's dream, he must continue dancing on the lake to avoid sinking and drowning, the dream may be a metaphoric reference to the necessity of continually coping with the world.\n\n== Plot ==\nJoel Garcia is a writer who, after a hiking accident at a mountain, must struggle with paralysis. At the same time, he carries a relationship with Anna, a married woman, with whom he was having an affair at the time of the accident. The lovers attempt to carry on their affair during his emotional and difficult rehabilitation as a [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Eric Stoltz]] as Joel Garcia\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as Raymond Hill\n* [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]] as Bloss\n* [[Helen Hunt]] as Anna\n* [[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]] as Rosa\n* [[Grace Zabriskie]] as Pat\n}}\n\n== Reception ==\n===Critical response===\n''The Waterdance'' received mostly positive reviews from critics; it holds a 94% approval rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 17 reviews.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Waterdance |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_waterdance |access-date=2022-09-27 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\nIn a review that awarded  three and a half stars out of four, [[Roger Ebert]] praised Stoltz's acting and commented, \"'''The Waterdance''<nowiki/>' is about the everyday process of continuing one's life under a tragically altered set of circumstances. It considers what life is, and under what conditions it is worth living. After all the cheap sentiment that's been brought to this subject over the years, it is exhilarating and challenging to see a movie that knows exactly what it's talking about, and looks you straight in the eye.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=1992-05-15 |title=The Waterdance |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-waterdance-1992 |access-date=2022-09-27 |website=RogerEbert.com}}</ref>\n\nSteve Davis of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' wrote, \"The performances are nothing less than extraordinary. Stoltz, an actor who has seldom exhibited anything but genial blandness, uses this temperament to good effect here as Joel, a man who tempers the bitterness he feels over what's happened to him with benign acceptance. Snipes and Forsythe are both superb as the two fellow travelers in wheelchairs whom Joel befriends in the ward; their emoting is so real you often forget they're actors.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Davis |first=Steve |date=1992-05-22 |title=Movie Review: The Waterdance |url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/events/film/1992-05-22/the-waterdance/ |access-date=2022-09-27 |website=[[Austin Chronicle]] |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n''The Waterdance'' won the Audience Award for Best Dramatic Feature and the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at the [[Sundance Film Festival|1992 Sundance Film Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=1992 Sundance Film Festival |url=http://history.sundance.org/events/27 |access-date=2022-09-27 |website=history.sundance.org}}</ref>\n\n''The Waterdance'' was nominated for four [[8th Independent Spirit Awards|Independent Spirit Awards]] in 1992 and was the only film to win two awards that year for [[Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature|Best First Feature]] and [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=1993-03-29 |title=Independent Spirit Awards Lives Up to Its Name : Movies: Irreverent, annual alternative awards program names 'The Player' as best of 1992. |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-29-ca-16653-story.html |access-date=2020-01-20 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0105789|title=The Waterdance}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|waterdance}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Waterdance, The}}\n[[Category:Sundance Film Festival award winners]]\n[[Category:1992 films]]\n[[Category:1992 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1992 drama films]]\n[[Category:1992 independent films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about paraplegics or quadriplegics]]\n[[Category:Films about writers]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Michael Steinberg]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Gale Anne Hurd]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Michael Convertino]]\n[[Category:The Samuel Goldwyn Company films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n[[Category:Films about disability]]\n\n\n{{1990s-drama-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
