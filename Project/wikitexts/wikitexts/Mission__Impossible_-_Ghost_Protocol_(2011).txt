It is the sequel to ''[[Mission: Impossible III]]'' (2006) and is the fourth installment in the [[Mission: Impossible (film series)|''Mission: Impossible'' film series]]. It also stars [[Jeremy Renner]], [[Simon Pegg]], and [[Paula Patton]]. In ''Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol'', the [[Impossible Missions Force]] (IMF) are shut down after being publicly implicated in a bombing of the [[Kremlin]], causing [[Ethan Hunt]] (Cruise) and his team to go without resources or backup in the life-threatening effort to clear their names.\n\nDevelopment for ''Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol'' began in August 2009, when Appelbaum and Nemec were hired to write the screenplay (which contained uncredited rewrites by eventual series director and writer [[Christopher McQuarrie]]). Cruise's return was confirmed by March 2010 after Bird was announced to replace [[J. J. Abrams]], who directed the predecessor. The film was officially titled in October 2010, after which, [[principal photography]] took place and lasted until March 2011, with filming locations including [[Mumbai]], [[Budapest]], [[Moscow]], [[Dubai]], and [[Canadian Motion Picture Park Studios]] in [[Vancouver]]. Like previous entries in the franchise, the cast completed most of their own stunts, while parts of the film was shot in [[IMAX]].\n\n''Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol'' premiered in Dubai on December 7, 2011 and was released in IMAX and select large-format theaters on December 16, before being theatrically released in the United States by [[Paramount Pictures]] on December 21. It received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the action sequences, Cruise's performance, and Bird's direction. It grossed $694 million worldwide, becoming the [[2011 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth-highest-grossing film of 2011]] as well as the highest grossing film in the franchise and the highest grossing film starring Cruise until the release of ''[[Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout]]'' in 2018. The next film in the series, ''[[Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation]]'', was released in 2015.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- WP:FILMPLOT recommends a plot summary to be 400 to 700 words. --> \n[[Impossible Missions Force|IMF]] agent Trevor Hanaway is killed in [[Budapest]] by assassin Sabine Moreau, who steals Russian nuclear launch codes to sell to the mysterious \"Cobalt\". IMF agent [[Ethan Hunt]] is extracted from a [[Moscow]] prison, along with an asset named Bogdan, by Hanaway's handler Jane Carter and newly promoted field agent Benji Dunn. The IMF tasks Hunt to infiltrate the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] for information on Cobalt, who blows the team's cover and forces them to abort the mission as a bomb destroys much of the Kremlin. Hunt is arrested by [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]] agent Anatoly Sidorov and blamed for the explosion.\n\nHunt escapes and meets with the IMF Secretary, who is in Moscow with intelligence analyst William Brandt. The Secretary explains that the President has initiated \"Ghost Protocol\", disavowing the entire IMF, but secretly orders Hunt to continue pursuing Cobalt. Sidorov's forces catch up to Hunt, and the Secretary is killed. Hunt escapes with Brandt, and they regroup with Carter and Dunn, identifying Cobalt as Kurt Hendricks, a [[Sweden|Swedish]]-born Russian nuclear strategist seeking [[nuclear war]] between the U.S. and Russia. Hendricks bombed the Kremlin and framed the IMF to cover his theft of a Russian launch-control device, and will meet Moreau at the [[Burj Khalifa]] in [[Dubai]] to buy the stolen launch codes. Hendricks has his right hand man Wistrom blackmail Leonid Lisenker, a Polish cryptographer, to authenticate the codes, threatening to kill his family otherwise.\n\nThe IMF team plans to intercept the codes by faking both meetings: Hunt and Brandt pose as Wistrom and Lisenker to receive the codes from Moreau; one floor away, Carter will pose as Moreau, passing counterfeit codes to the real Wistrom and Lisenker. Hunt is forced to climb the outside of the Burj Khalifa to access a [[Server (computing)|server]]. Hunt is forced to pass the real codes, as Lisenker can authenticate the codes, relying on radioactive [[isotopes]] in the paper to track Wistrom afterward. Completing the buy, Wistrom murders Lisenker preemptively, and Sidorov nearly apprehends Hunt, whom he knocks down. Moreau, having deduced that Hunt and Brandt were IMF agents, attempts to escape, only to get into a fight with Carter, who kicks her outside the window to her death, eliminating their only lead.\n\nHunt pursues Wistrom into a sandstorm, who unmasks himself as Hendricks and escapes, while Carter and Dunn confront Brandt over his unusual fighting skills in the hotel. Brandt admits that he asked to be removed from field duty after failing to protect Julia Meade, Ethan's wife; Hunt was imprisoned after the Serbian criminals who killed her turned up dead. With help from Bogdan, Ethan negotiates with arms dealer The Fog, who directs him to [[Mumbai]], where Hendricks is set to negotiate with Indian media tycoon Brij Nath for control of an obsolete Soviet military satellite. The Fog also informs Sidorov on the orders of Hunt. Carter [[seduces]] Nath to get the satellite override code, while Hunt, Brandt, and Dunn try to stop Hendricks and Wistrom from using Nath's broadcast station. \n\nHendricks has already sent the launch codes to a Russian [[Delta-class submarine|nuclear submarine]], firing a missile at [[San Francisco]] and has Wistrom  disable the station's computer systems and shuts down the power. Carter is wounded by Wistrom, while Brandt, who went to turn on the power, ends up fighting Wistrom and engages in a battle of wits, before Benji intervenes and kills Wistrom. Hunt pursues Hendricks inside an automatic car parking valet and fights him, until Hendricks jumps to his death to place the launch device out of reach. The team gets the systems online, and Hunt takes a dangerous fall to disable the missile moments before impact. Sidorov and his men arrive, only to find out that the IMF was innocent of the Kremlin bombing, and offers Hunt a ride to the hospital.\n\nIn [[Seattle]], Ethan meets with [[Luther Stickell]], and assembles his team. Brandt confesses his failure to protect Julia, but Ethan reveals that her \"death\" and the Serbians' murder were a plot to give her a new identity and let him infiltrate the prison to find Bogdan. A relieved Brandt accepts his mission, becoming an agent once again. Julia arrives and shares a smile with Ethan from afar, before he slips away and receives an IMF debriefing about a breach in their military communications network by an emerging terrorist organization known as [[Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation|\"The Syndicate\"]], who have control of the IMF's entire drone fleet, with their targets unknown.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as [[Ethan Hunt]], an agent of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) and protagonist of the film\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as William Brandt, the IMF Secretary's aide and an intelligence analyst\n* [[Simon Pegg]] as Benji Dunn, a new IMF field agent and former IMF technician\n* [[Paula Patton]] as Jane Carter, an IMF agent and Hanaway's handler who works with Ethan\n* [[Michael Nyqvist]] as Kurt Hendricks, a Swedish-born Russian nuclear strategist codenamed 'Cobalt'\n* [[Vladimir Mashkov]] as Anatoly Sidorov, a Russian SVR Agent who is after Ethan\n* [[L\u00e9a Seydoux]] as Sabine Moreau, an assassin who worked for Hendricks at Dubai\n* [[Josh Holloway]] as Trevor Hanaway, an IMF agent murdered by Moreau\n* [[Anil Kapoor]] as Brij Nath, a media tycoon at Mumbai\n* [[Samuli Edelmann]] as Marius Wistrom, Hendrick's henchman\n* [[Ivan Shvedoff]] as Leonid Lisenker, a cryptography expert coerced by Hendricks\n* [[Miraj Grbi\u0107]] as Bogdan, an informant in a Moscow prison\n* [[Ilia Volok]] as The Fog, an arms dealer and Bogdan's cousin\n* [[Andreas Wisniewski]] as The Fog's contact\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] (uncredited) as the IMF Secretary<ref name=\"Dargis\">{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/movies/mission-impossible-ghost-protocol-review.html | title= Movie Review: ''Mission: Impossible \u2014 Ghost Protocol'': Falling Off Skyscrapers Sometimes Hurts a Bit| first=Manohla |last=Dargis | work =[[The New York Times]] | date= December 15, 2011| access-date= May 10, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Ving Rhames]] (uncredited cameo) as [[Luther Stickell]]<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.fwweekly.com/2011/12/14/film-shorts-ii-138/ | title= Film Shorts > Opening: ''Mission: Impossible \u2014 Ghost Protocol'' | first= Kristian | last= Lin | work= [[Fort Worth Weekly]] | location= Texas | date= December 14, 2011 | access-date= May 10, 2015 | archive-date= December 15, 2012 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121215105712/http://www.fwweekly.com/2011/12/14/film-shorts-ii-138/ | url-status= dead }}</ref>\n* [[Michelle Monaghan]] (uncredited cameo) as Julia Meade-Hunt, Ethan's wife<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Chris-Evans-Michelle-Monaghan-Sign-Anti-Romantic-Comedy-Many-Splintered-Thing-32818.html | title=Chris Evans And Michelle Monaghan Sign On For Anti-Romantic Comedy A Many Splintered Thing| date=September 6, 2012 | first=Eric |last=Eisenberg | publisher= CinemaBlend.com | archive-date= December 23, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121223074642/http://www.cinemablend.com/new/chris-evans-michelle-monaghan-sign-anti-romantic-comedy-many-splintered-thing-32818.html | url-status=live |quote=Monaghan, who last appeared in an uncredited role in ''Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol''. ...}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nDespite ''[[Mission: Impossible III]]'' earning less than its predecessors at the box office, its critical reception was much better than its predecessors and [[Paramount Pictures]] was keen on developing a fourth in the series.<ref>{{cite web |last=Harmsworth |first=Andrei |title=Cruise sets out on new mission |url=http://metro.co.uk/2008/04/30/cruise-sets-out-on-new-mission-115862/ |website=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=[[DMG Media]]|access-date=August 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628184605/http://metro.co.uk/2008/04/30/cruise-sets-out-on-new-mission-115862/|archive-date=June 28, 2015|date=April 30, 2008}}</ref> In August 2009, [[Josh Appelbaum]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Nemec]] were hired to write the film's screenplay.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fleming|first1=Michael|title='Mission Impossible 4\u2032 recruits scribes|url=https://variety.com/2009/film/markets-festivals/mission-impossible-4-recruits-scribes-1118006998/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|access-date=August 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801190831/http://variety.com/2009/film/markets-festivals/mission-impossible-4-recruits-scribes-1118006998/|archive-date=August 1, 2015|date=August 6, 2009}}</ref> Because of other commitments, [[J.
