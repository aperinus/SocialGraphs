The film was released in the Hong Kong on 24 September 2004. The film is a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Police Story (film series)|''Police Story'' series]] and is the fifth installment of the series. ''New Police Story'' relies much more on drama and heavy action than its predecessors.\n\n==Plot==\nA group of 5 rebellious youths rob a bank with the intention of shooting police officers before making their escape. Inspector Chan Kwok-wing and his squad are called to arrest the gang after their hideout is revealed. However, the place is rigged with traps, and the entire squad is decimated. After being defeated at several challenges with the rebels, Chan, the sole survivor of the incident, takes a year long leave from the police force to binge-drink after losing the squad, including Hong, the younger brother of Chan's girlfriend Ho Yee. Chan is discovered by a stranger, who identifies himself as Frank Cheng, Chan's new partner. Frank tries to convince Chan to cancel his leave and reopen the case. \n\nChan refuses, but comes back to his senses by apprehending two youths who robbed him earlier while Chan was drunk. Chan's superior Chiu Chan, initially believing that Chan's overconfidence alone was responsible for the disastrous raid, challenges them to solve the case before he does. Frank explains to Chan about his persistence on the case that he is kin of a deceased squad member. Frank and Chan visit and convince former colleague Sam Wong, who is hiding in a bar, to reveal a clue from the night of the first robbery, a watch which he snatched from one of the robbers. Wong tells them that one of the gang members is a woman and that they like to play [[X Games|X-games]]. \n\nChan and Frank are tailed by Chiu and the police as they search for the owner of the watch at an upcoming X-Games event; Sam has been arrested by the police to assist in the investigation. At the event, held on the rooftop of a skyscraper, Frank and Chan manage to locate one of the gang members, Fire, while Sam and the police interrupt the event and single out the woman robber Sue. Before they can apprehend them, Fire fatally wounds Sam, and the two escape. Sam confesses to Chan that he was blackmailed by the gang to aid them in ambushing Chan's team. Chiu, upon overhearing this, has a change of heart. In the ensuing chase, Sue, Fire, Chan and Frank scaled down the building on a tightrope. \n\nTo distract Chan, Fire shoots a bus driver, forcing Chan and Frank to save the bus. When Chan's old commanding officer, Inspector Tai, comes to him to complain about the collateral damage, he reveals that he never assigned a partner to Chan. Chan angrily confronts Frank, who is neither a cop nor a kin of deceased squad member. Frank admits that even though he wanted to be a cop, he failed the exam. Chan is convinced that Frank is sincere, and the two are briefed by Frank's friend, Officer Sa Sa, that the gang members all come from rich families and the leader Joe is actually the son of the police chief. The gang also created online video games based on their raids.\n\nSue and Fire return to the gang's new hideout, where Joe kills Sue, who was critically wounded during the chase. His gang accesses Chan's police file on a computer and plants a bomb on Ho Yee after luring her to the police station. Chan and Ho Yee cut the wires, with no effect, leading the police to believe that it is a fake. But when the two get ready to leave, a small wire attached to Ho Yee's back activates a secondary trigger, causing the bomb to explode. The blast causes pipes to land on Ho Yee, knocking her into a coma. When Frank's false identity is revealed, Chan and Frank are arrested. The gang visits them and taunts them about their next target. Frank and Chan are later unofficially released to apprehend the gang.\n\nThrough the online game, Chan, Frank and Sa Sa learn that the gang's next target is the [[Union Bank of Hong Kong|Bank of Hong Kong]]. In order to avoid another botched raid, Chan has the officers escort the public out of the building, and brings the gang members' parents to cause dissent within Joe's gang, prompting Joe to kill gang member Max for surrendering. In the resulting altercation, Frank blindsided Fire, injuring him before retreat away from Joe's firing. At a [[Lego]] exhibit, Chan catches up with him and has a rematch of hand-to-hand combat with Tin Tin and prevails, before Tin Tin is critically shot by Joe's friendly fire. Chan follows Joe, the last man standing, to the roof, where Joe threatens to throw Frank, whom he has captured to his death. Joe challenges Chan to a race to assemble a semi-automatic pistol, a rematch of another earlier challenge which Chan wins this time by loading the bullet directly into the chamber of the gun instead. \n\nA number of policemen arrive on the roof, along with Joe's outraged father. Chan attempts to talk him into surrendering; Joe admits defeat, but deliberately aims his empty gun at Chan, choosing suicide by cop with his father watching. Chan rushes to rescue Frank, and both of them fall off the building, landing on a fireman's inflated cushion. In the hospital, Ho Yee has recovered and prepares to leave before accepting Chan's marriage proposal. Frank is taken under arrest for assumption of authority. When Chan looks at the jacket Frank left behind, he remembers meeting him as a child after Frank's impoverished father was killed by a speeding truck while trying to steal some food, and giving comfort to the orphaned boy, prompting Frank to become a policeman and repay Chan for his kindness.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as Senior [[Chan Ka-kui|Inspector Chan Kwok-wing]]\n* [[Nicholas Tse]] as Frank Cheng Siu-fung\n* [[Charlie Yeung]] as Sun Ho-yee\n* [[Charlene Choi]] as Sa Sa\n* [[Daniel Wu]] as Joe Kwan\n* [[Dave Wong]] as Sam Wong Sum\n* [[Andy On]] as Law Tin-tin\n* [[Terence Yin]] as Fire\n* [[Hayama Go]] as Max Leung\n* Coco Chiang as Sue Chow\n* [[Yu Rongguang]] as Commander Chiu Chan\n* Chun Sun as Joe Kwan's father\n* Lui Yau-wai as Joe Kwan's mother (as Lisa Lui)\n* Lee Ting-fung \u2013 Joe Kwan at Age 6\n* Lam Chi-Tai (2) as Thieves' lawyer\n* Lee Tin-Cheung as Thieves' lawyer\n* Lee Ji-Kei as Max's father\n* Luk Mei-Ling as Max's mother\n* Brenda Chan Kwai-Fan as Thieves' parent\n* Ken Ling Hiu-Wa as Thieves' parent\n* [[Wu Bai]] as Father of Frank Cheng\n* Lau Ho-Chun as Frank Cheng (aged 8)\n* [[Liu Kai-chi]] as Chief Tai\n* [[John Shum]] as Eric Chow\n* [[Ken Lo]] as Kwong, Wing's team member\n* Asuka Higuchi as Kwong's wife\n* [[Steven Cheung (actor)|Steven Cheung]] as Green-haired thief\n* [[Kenny Kwan]] as Red-haired thief\n* [[Deep Ng]] as Hong, Wing's team member\n* Tony Ho as Chui, Wing's team member\n* [[Timmy Hung]] as Tin-ming, Wing's team member\n* Sammy Hung as Tin-chiu, Wing's team member\n* [[Carl Ng]] as Carl, Wing's team member\n* [[Andrew Lin]] as Hoi, Wing's team member\n* Samuel Pang as Sam, Wing's team member\n* [[Philip Ng]] as Philip, Wing's team member\n* Winnie Leung as Female Hostage\n* Eric Kwok as Male Hostage\n* [[Mandy Chiang]] as Chui's girlfriend\n* [[Evergreen Mak|Mak Bau]] as Negotiator\n* Ringo Chen as Tourist\n* Park Huyn-jin as Disco Bouncer\n* Ng Kong as Disco Bouncer\n* He Jun as Disco Bouncer\n* Anthony Carpio as Disco Bouncer\n* Chan Tat-kwong as Disco Bouncer\n* Stephen Rohn as X-Game Player\n* Stephen Julien as X-Game Player\n* Ho Wai-yip as Police Officer Outside Convenience Store\n* [[Audiotraffic]] \u2013 Jazz Bar Band\n* Victy Wong as Cop\n* Zac Koo as HKCEC Police man\n* Stephen Bohn as X-Game Player\n* [[Mars (actor)|Mars]] (extra) (''uncredited'')\n* Roderick Lam as Sam's subordinate\n* Jason Yip as Student's father\n* Nic Yan as Detention Suspect\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Jackie Chan stunt team===\n* [[Brad Allan|Bradley James Allan]]\n* Paul Andreovski\n* Nicky Li\n* [[Ken Lo]]\n* [[Mars (actor)|Mars]]\n* Wu Gang\n* Park Hyun-jin\n* He Jun\n* Lee In-seob\n* Han Kwan-hua\n\n==Production==\nPrincipal photography took place in Hong Kong between 1 January and 31 December 2003.\n\n== Box office ==\n''New Police Story'' opened in Hong Kong on 23 September 2004 where it made [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]5,625,746 in its first three days.
