Set in a fictional Caribbean [[banana republic]], it follows a group of vacationers' attempts to create a luxury resort out of a seedy nightclub, and the series of increasingly unlikely events takes place.\n\nThe film reunites director / co-writer Ramis with most of his [[Second City Television|SCTV]] co-stars \u2013 ''SCTV'' cast members [[Andrea Martin]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Rick Moranis]],<ref>Moranis and Ramis were never actually cast members of SCTV at the same time; Ramis left SCTV partway through season 2, before Moranis joined in season 3.

It was the final film of actor [[Adolph Caesar]], who died in March 1986, four months before the film's release.<ref name=\"star-news\" />\n\n==Plot==\nJack Moniker is a Chicago firefighter who is injured on the job. Using his disability insurance payout, he retires to the small [[Caribbean]] island of Saint Nicholas, and buys a small property. Anthony Croyden Hayes, appointed by the British crown as governor of St. Nicholas, is more concerned with vacationing than governing. Miss Phillipa Lloyd, who is visiting St. Nicholas with some friends, decides to stay permanently and becomes Jack's girlfriend.\n\nJack befriends financially troubled [[reggae]] musician Ernest Reed and they form Club Paradise, which they market as a [[Club Med]]-style resort complete with a brochure that features photographs of Jack in various disguises on every page. This attracts a handful of tourists, including Barry and Barry who are there for the marijuana and the women. Much of the film involves the tourists' comic misadventures adjusting to island life and the low-rent facilities of Club Paradise. Also traveling to the island is ''[[The New York Times]]'' travel writer Terry Hamlin who ends up spending most of her time in the company of Governor Hayes. Adding to the fun is suburban housewife Linda White, who is vacationing with her husband Randy, who despite the very favorable surroundings and atmosphere, is not very randy.\n\nVoit Zerbe plays a key role, as a developer who wants to run Jack and Ernest off their property so he can build a massive high-end casino on the beach as part of a deal he's making with two business partners. To do that, he uses the help of the local [[prime minister]] Solomon Gundy and the prime minister's men to cause trouble and get Club Paradise to close \"legally.\" Jack and Ernest go so far as to sneak aboard Zerbe's yacht to provide some \"useful intelligence\" for Governor Hayes by finding out what is going to happen to the future of Saint Nicholas. They skin dive to the yacht where they are captured by local police and thrown in jail. When Prime Minister Gundy's strong arm tactics don't work, he orders a military takeover of the island. Ernest builds up a resistance force, and St. Nicholas is soon threatened with the possibility of civil war, which is averted at the last minute with assistance from Jack and Governor Hayes. As Gundy's takeover fails, Zerbe and his partners leave Saint Nicholas and head for the [[Cayman Islands]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Jack Moniker\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as Governor Anthony Croyden Hayes\n* [[Rick Moranis]] as Barry Nye\n* [[Jimmy Cliff]] as Ernest Reed\n* [[Twiggy]] as Phillipa \"Philadelphia\" Lloyd\n* [[Adolph Caesar]] as Prime Minister Solomon \"Sol\" Gundy\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as Barry Steinberg\n* [[Joanna Cassidy]] as Terry Hamlin\n* [[Andrea Martin]] as Linda White\n* [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Voit Zerbe\n* [[Joe Flaherty]] as Pilot\n* [[Steven Kampmann]] as Dr. Randy White\n* [[Robin Duke]] as Mary Lou\n* [[Mary Gross]] as Jackie\n* [[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]] as Toby Prooth\n* [[Antoinette Bower]] as Pamela\n* [[Peter Bromilow]] as Nigel\n* [[Louise Bennett]] as Portia\n* [[Charles Hyatt]] as Mr. Banks\n* [[Leonie Forbes]] as Mrs. Geddes\n* [[Richard Wiese]] as Christopher\n* [[Carl Bradshaw (actor)|Carl Bradshaw]] as Cabbie\n* [[Carey Lowell]] as Fashion Model\n* [[Louis Zorich]] as Swiss Businessman\n* [[Bruce McGill]] as Dave\n* [[Dave and Ansell Collins|Ansel Collins]], [[Earl \"Chinna\" Smith|Chinna Smith]], [[Bertram McLean]], Christopher Meredith, Wilburn Cole, and Sydney Wolfe as Flamboyant (Ernest Reed's band)\n}}\n[[Harold Ramis]]' wife Anne Ramis also cameos as a travel agent.\n\n==Production==\nShooting took place in [[Jamaica]], [[Chicago]], and [[Los Angeles]] from April<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZGgaAAAAIBAJ&pg=5738,3921333&dq=club-paradise&hl=en|last=Maples|first=Tina|title=Offstage: Tropical capers|date=April 5, 1985|accessdate=December 31, 2010|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|The Milwaukee Journal]]|publisher=[[Journal Communications]]|page=3 (Accent; Weekend)}}</ref> to July 1985.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wIg_AAAAIBAJ&pg=5995,6472074&hl=en|agency=[[Associated Press]] (AP)|title=Harold Ramis Directs Robin Williams|date=July 18, 1986|accessdate=December 31, 2010|work=[[The Mount Airy News]] TV Plus|page=8}}</ref> The titular \"Club Paradise\" was a set constructed on [[Winifred Beach]] in [[Portland Parish]], while other scenes were shot in the city of [[Port Antonio]].
