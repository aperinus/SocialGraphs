As part of their latest investigation, the men have begun photographing individuals at the moment of death; done properly, the resultant photos depict a strange smudge hovering around the body. Though the society concludes that they have captured evidence of the soul escaping the body, Cunningham is sceptical.\n\nAt a party to celebrate his recent engagement, Cunningham is making home movies with a primitive movie camera of his own invention when his fianc\u00e9e and son are killed in a boating accident. When Cunningham views the film, he sees that not only has he captured the blur, but that it is moving towards his son, and not away from him. From this, Cunningham concludes that the blur is not the soul but a force known in [[Greek mythology]] as an \"asphyx\", a kind of personal [[Grim Reaper]] from Greek mythology that comes for every individual at the moment of his or her death.\n\nWhile filming a public execution as a protest against [[capital punishment]], Cunningham activates a spotlight that he has crafted using [[phosphorus]] stones beneath a [[drip irrigation]] valve. Later, when viewing the film with his ward, Giles, Cunningham sees that the condemned man's asphyx was briefly held suspended in the spotlight's beam. Concluding that an individual's asphyx is an organic force and therefore subject to the laws of physics, Cunningham theorises that some property of the energy released by the combination of phosphorus and water renders the asphyx immobile. If correct, this would mean that an asphyx could be trapped, and that an individual would be immortal so long as their asphyx remained imprisoned.\n\nGiles and Cunningham successfully capture the asphyx of a dying guinea pig and seal it in the family tomb, beneath a spring fuelled by the lake. Seeing immortality in his grasp, Cunningham tasks Giles with helping him to capture his own asphyx, deciding that his contributions to science are too important for him to die. Cunningham commissions the construction of an impenetrable vault door on his family tomb, with a complex combination lock as the only means of opening it; once he has captured his asphyx, Giles is under instruction to seal the asphyx inside, so that no one can ever set it free.\n\nUsing an electric chair to slowly kill himself, Cunningham summons his own asphyx, however, Giles is only experienced in capturing an asphyx with two men, and is forced to rely on his fianc\u00e9 (and stepsister), Christina, for assistance. Christina is horrified with the experiments, but agrees to participate when Cunningham tells her that he will give his blessing for the two to marry if they allow him to make them immortal.\n\nTheorising that imminent death, and not actual death, will summon an asphyx, Cunningham places Christina on a guillotine operated by Giles. During the experiment, the guinea pig chews through a hose pumping water onto the phosphorus stones being used to capture the asphyx. In the resultant panic, Christina is decapitated and dies.\n\nDespondent, Cunningham insists that Giles open the vault and free his asphyx. Giles agrees, on the condition that Cunningham first grant him immortality. Unbeknownst to Cunningham, Giles rigs the procedure (as he no longer wishes to live without his fianc\u00e9e), removing the phosphorus stones from the spotlight. As Cunningham attempts to gas Giles to death to summon his asphyx, he realises the equipment is not working, turns off the gas and turns on the oxygen to save Giles. Giles strikes a match. The resulting explosion kills Giles and destroys all of the equipment required to capture asphyxes.\n\nThough Giles ostensibly left behind the combination to the vault on a slip of paper, Cunningham destroys it, resolving that his own immortality is God's punishment for the deaths of Giles and Christina. In an epilogue set in the 1970s, an ancient, disfigured Cunningham roams the streets of London with the guinea pig. He wanders into the path of an imminent car collision, which kills both of the drivers; a police officer responding to the scene is shocked to find that Cunningham, crushed beneath the two vehicles, is still alive.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Stephens]] as Sir Hugo Cunningham\n* [[Robert Powell]] as Giles Cunningham\n* [[Jane Lapotaire]] as Christina Cunningham\n* [[Alex Scott (actor)|Alex Scott]] as Sir Edward Barrett\n* [[Ralph Arliss]] as Clive Cunningham\n* [[Fiona Walker]] as Anna Wheatley\n* [[Terry Scully]] as Pauper\n* John Lawrence as Mason\n* David Grey as Vicar\n* [[Tony Caunter]] as Warden\n* Paul Bacon as 1st Member\n\n==Release==\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Home media===\n''The Asphyx'' was released on [[DVD]] by [[Image Entertainment]] on 3 March 1998.
