(musical)|Broadway production of the same name]]. Directed by [[Gene Kelly]] and written and produced by [[Ernest Lehman]], the film stars [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Walter Matthau]], [[Michael Crawford]], [[Danny Lockin]], [[Tommy Tune]], [[Fritz Feld]], [[Marianne McAndrew]], [[E. J. Peaker]] and [[Louis Armstrong]] (whose recording of the [[Hello, Dolly! (song)|title tune]] had become a number-one single in May 1964).<ref>Bronson, Fred. ''The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits'' (2003), Billboard Books, {{ISBN|0-8230-7677-6}}</ref> The film follows the story of [[Dolly Gallagher Levi|Dolly Levi]], a strong-willed matchmaker who travels to [[Yonkers, New York]] in order to find a match for the miserly \"well-known unmarried half-a-millionaire\" Horace Vandergelder. In doing so, she convinces his niece, his niece's intended and Horace's two clerks to travel to New York. ''Hello, Dolly!'' along with [[Cactus Flower (film)|Cactus Flower]], are the movies that end the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].[citation?]\n\nReleased on December 16, 1969, by [[20th Century Fox]], the film won three [[Academy Award]]s for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Score of a Musical Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]] and was nominated for a further four Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].

Dolly makes a living through [[matchmaking]], and also through arranging all manner of other things, (\"Just Leave Everything to Me\"). She is currently seeking a wife for grumpy Horace Vandergelder ([[Walter Matthau]]), the well-known \"half-a-millionaire\", but it soon becomes clear that Dolly intends to marry Horace herself. Dolly travels to [[Yonkers, New York]] to visit Horace. Ambrose Kemper ([[Tommy Tune]]), a young artist, wants to marry Horace's niece, Ermengarde (Joyce Ames), but Horace opposes this because he feels Ambrose cannot provide financial security. Horace, who is the owner of Vandergelder's Hay and Feed, explains to his two clerks, Cornelius Hackl ([[Michael Crawford]]) and Barnaby Tucker ([[Danny Lockin]]), that he is going to get married, though what he really wants is a housekeeper, (\"It Takes A Woman\"). He plans to travel to New York that very day to march in the 14th Street Parade, and also to propose to milliner Irene Malloy, whom he has met through Dolly Levi.  Dolly arrives in Yonkers and sends Horace ahead to the city. Before leaving, he tells Cornelius and Barnaby to mind the store.\n\nCornelius, weary of his dull existence, decides that he and Barnaby need to get out of Yonkers. Dolly overhears, and decides to set Cornelius and Barnaby up with Irene Molloy and her shop assistant, Minnie Fay ([[E. J. Peaker]]). She also helps Ambrose and Ermengarde, entering them in a dance contest at the very fancy Harmonia Gardens restaurant, which Dolly and her late husband frequented. The entire company take the train to New York, (\"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\").\n\nIn New York, Irene and Minnie open their hat shop for the afternoon. Irene does not love Horace Vandergelder, but knows that the marriage will provide her with financial security and an escape from her boring job.   However, Irene hopes to escape her loveless marriage, and plans to try and find real love before the summer is over, (\"Ribbons Down My Back\"). Cornelius and Barnaby arrive at the shop and pretend to be rich- Irene seems to take to Cornelius immediately. Horace and Dolly arrive and Cornelius and Barnaby hide. Minnie screams when she finds Cornelius hiding in an armoire. Horace is about to open the armoire himself, but Dolly \"searches\" it and pronounces it empty. After hearing Cornelius sneeze, Horace storms out upon realizing there are men hiding in the shop, although he is unaware that they are his clerks. Dolly arranges for Cornelius and Barnaby, who are still pretending to be rich, to take the ladies out to dinner at Harmonia Gardens to make up for their humiliation. Dolly briefly tries to teach Cornelius and Barnaby to dance, which leads to the whole town dancing in the local park, (\"Dancing\").\n\nThe clerks and the ladies go to watch the Fourteenth Street Association Parade together. Alone, Dolly asks her first husband Ephram's permission to marry Horace, requesting a sign. She resolves to move on with life (\"Before the Parade Passes By\"). After meeting an old friend, Gussie Granger (Judy Knaiz), on a float in the parade, Dolly catches up with the annoyed Vandergelder as he is marching in the parade. She tells him the heiress Ernestina Semple (changed from the stage version's Ernestina Money; also Judy Knaiz) would be perfect for him and asks him to meet her at Harmonia Gardens that evening.\n\nCornelius is determined to get a kiss before the night is over. Since the clerks have no money to hire a carriage, they tell the girls that walking to the restaurant is more stylish (\"Elegance\"). In a quiet flat, Dolly prepares for the evening (\"Love is Only Love\"). At the Harmonia Gardens Restaurant, Rudolph ([[David Hurst]]), the head waiter, whips his crew into shape for Dolly Levi's return. Horace arrives to meet his date, who is really Dolly's friend Gussie. As it turns out, she is not rich or elegant as Dolly implied, and she soon leaves after being bored by Horace, just as she and Dolly planned.\n\nCornelius, Barnaby and their dates arrive and are unaware that Horace is also at the restaurant. Dolly makes her triumphant return to the restaurant and is greeted in style by the staff (\"[[Hello, Dolly! (song)|Hello, Dolly!]]\"). She sits in the now-empty seat at Horace's table and proceeds to tell him that no matter what he says, she will not marry him. Fearful of being caught, Cornelius confesses to the ladies that he and Barnaby have no money, and Irene, who knew they were pretending all along, offers to pay for the meal. She then realizes that she left her handbag with all her money in it at home. The four try to sneak out during the polka contest, but Horace recognizes them and also spots Ermengarde and Ambrose. In the ensuing confrontation, Vandergelder fires Cornelius and Barnaby (although they claim to have already quit) and they are forced to flee as a riot breaks out. Cornelius professes his love for Irene because \"It Only Takes a Moment\". Horace declares that he wouldn't marry Dolly if she were the last woman in the world. Dolly angrily bids him farewell; while he's bored and lonely, she'll be living the high life (\"So Long, Dearie\").\n\nThe next morning, back at the hay and feed store, Cornelius and Irene, Barnaby and Minnie, and Ambrose and Ermengarde each come to collect the money Vandergelder owes them. Chastened, he finally admits that he needs Dolly in his life, but she is unsure about the marriage until Ephram sends her a sign. Vandergelder spontaneously repeats a saying of Ephram's: \"Money, pardon the expression, is like manure. It's not worth a thing unless it's spread about, encouraging young things to grow.\" Cornelius becomes Horace's business partner at the store, and Barnaby fills Cornelius' old position. Horace tells Dolly life would be dull without her, and she promises that she'll \"never go away again\" (\"Finale\").\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Hello, Dolly!5.jpg|thumb|right|L-R: [[Michael Crawford]], [[Marianne McAndrew]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[E.

The locomotive, used in \"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\", was restored specifically for the film. The [[Poughkeepsie (Metro-North station)]] trackside platform was used at the beginning when Dolly was on her way to [[Yonkers]].\n\nThe church scene was filmed on the grounds of the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]], but the church's facade was constructed only for the film. New York City scenes were filmed on the [[20th Century-Fox]] lot in California. Some of the exteriors still exist.
