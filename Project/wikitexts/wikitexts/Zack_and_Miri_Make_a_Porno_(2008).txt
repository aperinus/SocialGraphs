It was released on October 31, 2008.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=January 2021}}\nZack Brown and Miriam \"Miri\" Linky are [[roommate]]s in [[Monroeville, Pennsylvania]] (a [[Pittsburgh]] suburb), having been friends since the first grade. Despite their jobs (Miri's at the local shopping mall and Zack's at a coffee shop), their utility bills have been unpaid for months, due to Zack mostly devoting his free time to a fanatic following of the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] and his status in the community amateur hockey team, the Monroeville Zombies. After work on the night before [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], their water is shut off before their [[high school reunion]].\n\nAt the reunion, Miri attempts to seduce her attractive former classmate Bobby Long, while Zack converses with Brandon St. Randy, who reveals that he is a [[Homosexual|gay]] [[porn star]] and Bobby's boyfriend. After they return home from the reunion, the apartment's electricity is turned off. Inspired by Brandon St. Randy and a successful [[viral video]] that a pair of teenage boys filmed of Miri changing in Zack's workplace for the reunion (revealing that she wore unattractive \"granny panties\" underwear), and emboldened by the cultural mainstreaming of pornographic entertainment, Zack convinces a reluctant Miri that they should make a [[pornographic]] film to earn money.\n\nGathering a group of acquaintances and hired help as the cast and crew, they decide to film a pornographic ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[parody]], entitled ''Star Whores''. Delaney, the film's producer and Zack's co-worker, rents film equipment and a building to use as a studio. When they return to the studio after the first night of filming, the building is being demolished, with all the equipment and costumes inside. They are told that the man that rented it to them has run off with the money. Later at the coffee shop where Zack works, he realizes that his boss threatened to install a hidden camera, which Zack finds and decides to use to replace their lost film equipment. Zack retools his film to take place in the coffee shop, revamping the film to one with a coffee shop motif, ''Swallow My Cockuccino''. The group shoots the film after hours.\n\nDespite insisting that they would not let sex with each other affect their friendship, Zack and Miri soon develop romantic feelings for each other. When it comes time for Zack and Miri to have sex on camera, they find that instead of the clinical sex enacted by the actors in the other scenes, their interlude is romantic and heartfelt. Later the next evening, Zack and Miri are at home tentatively about to discuss their reactions to the scene, when suddenly their apartment's electricity and water service return. The rest of the actors and crew reveal that they pooled their resources to pay one month of the couple's bills and are throwing them an early [[wrap party]].\n\nAt the party, one of the other actresses, Stacey, asks Miri about asking Zack to have sex, since she's nervous about her upcoming scene with him. Although Miri has realized that she has developed feelings for Zack, she approves Stacey's request. When Stacey relates this to Zack, the two retreat to Zack's bedroom, much to Miri's dismay.\n\nThe next evening, Zack is preparing to film a scene between Stacey and another actor, Lester, that was supposed to have been with Lester and Miri. Zack is dismayed when Miri shows up and insists on shooting the scene as originally planned. In the back room, an incredulous Zack asks if she is doing this to retaliate, pointing out that Stacey told him that Miri did not mind her sleeping with Zack. Miri corrects him, clarifying that she did not mind that Stacey merely ''offered'' to sleep with him. Perceiving this to have been some type of test, Zack admits that during the sex scene they filmed together, they were actually making love and were emotionally connected, and that he loves Miri. When Miri does not reciprocate, Zack storms out of the coffee shop, quitting the film and his job, and moves out of the apartment.\n\nThree months later, Delaney goes to see Zack, who has a job dressing in a hockey goon costume and letting people shoot him with paintball guns during Pittsburgh Penguins games. Delaney convinces him to come to Delaney's home to see the unfinished film and help complete it. Zack agrees, and as Delaney and the cameraman Deacon explain, Zack learns that Miri never filmed her sex scene with Lester. Zack goes to Miri's apartment and reveals to her that he never slept with Stacey; instead, they talked about Miri all night. He proclaims his love to Miri, who reciprocates.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Zack and Miri get married and, aided by Delaney and his worker's compensation settlement, start their own [[video production]] company, ''Zack and Miri Make Your Porno'', which makes videos for amateur couples.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Zack Brown\n* [[Elizabeth Banks]] as Miriam \"Miri\" Linky\n* [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]] as Delaney\n* [[Jason Mewes]] as Lester\n* [[Traci Lords]] as Bubbles\n* [[Jeff Anderson]] as Deacon Anderson\n* [[Katie Morgan]] as Stacey\n* Ricky Mabe as Barry\n* [[Justin Long]] as Brandon St. Randy\n* [[Brandon Routh]] as Robert \"Bobby\" Long\n* [[Tyler Labine]] as Drunk Willy\n* [[Tisha Campbell-Martin]] as Angelina\n* [[Tom Savini]] as Jenkins\n* [[Jennifer Schwalbach Smith|Jennifer Schwalbach]] as Betsy\n* [[Gerry Bednob]] as Mr. Surya\n* [[Kenny Hotz]] as Zack \"Zack II\" Knutson\n* [[David Early]] as Auditioner\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe genesis of ''Zack and Miri'' has been in Kevin Smith's mind since the 1990s. Two porn-centered projects were in development. One was a film called ''Name.'' It was intended to be a follow up (not a sequel) to ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' that would have starred the trio from that movie, [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]], [[Ben Affleck]], and [[Joey Lauren Adams]] and to be set in the [[View Askewniverse]]. But the project was not made, and was replaced with ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/kevin-smith/262176/the-unmade-films-of-kevin-smith|title=The Unmade Films of Kevin Smith|publisher=Den of Geeks|last=Leane|first=Rob|date=February 13, 2017|access-date=August 22, 2017}}</ref> The second attempt was in 1997 as a failed 22-episode series titled ''Hiatus.'' The series would have starred Lee again, and was about a man returning home after being away in California and leading a double life as a porn star. When he pitched the series to TV networks, they all rejected the idea believing that the kind of material handed to them can never happen on television.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Zack-Miri-Make-Porno-Was-Originally-TV-Show-17905.html|title=Zack And Miri Make A Porno Was Originally A TV Show|date=3 April 2010|access-date=August 22, 2017}}</ref> However, he kept the idea in mind and wrote a script following ''[[Clerks II]]'' that would be porn-bent.\n\n===Pre-production===\nAccording to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', [[The Weinstein Company]] greenlit the project based solely on the title.<ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/movies/2008318894_kevinsmithqampa28.html Mark Rahner. \"Kevin Smith, director of \"Zack and Miri Make a Porno\"\"]; ''[[Seattle Times]]'' October 28, 2008</ref> Kevin Smith originally wrote the film to be set in [[Minnesota]], where he had previously shot ''[[Mallrats]]'', and where he had stated a desire to shoot again.

He and his characters revel in dialogue that riffs on body parts and bodily fluids, but Mr. Smith's stories are bathed \u2013 metaphorically! \u2013 in syrup and schmaltz. So ''Zack and Miri Make a Porno'', in spite of its sometimes tiresome, sometimes amusing lewdness, follows a gee-whiz romantic-comedy formula that would not be out of place on the [[Disney Channel]]. Two best friends who have always been in love with each other discover that ... they have always been in love with each other. Granted, this revelation occurs while they are having sex in front of a camera, but it is so sweet and predictable that these potentially tawdry circumstances hardly matter.</blockquote>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and stated that, \"Somehow Kevin Smith's very excesses defuse the material.

Smith made a statement about featuring the song in the film:\n\n{{blockquote|It's an old song that I first heard in '95, when we were putting together the ''Mallrats'' soundtrack. It was actually in the film for the first test screening, but Live decided they wanted to hold onto it as a potential single off their [[Secret Samadhi|next album]] (which would follow ''[[Throwing Copper]]''). When I was editing ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'', the song had still never surfaced or been released, so I put in a request for it again. Again, I was denied. Third time, apparently, was the charm. Needed a song for that sequence in ''Zack and Miri'' and remembered the Live track. This time, the band signed off on us using the track. Took 13 years, but was worth the wait.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thegate.ca/front-page/02324/tiff-08-play-that-funky-music/ |title=TIFF 08: Play that funky music |first= W.

An older song by mc chris, \"[[Fett's Vette]]\", was also used in the film, as well as \"[[Sex and Candy]]\" by [[Marcy Playground]] and [[Jermaine Stewart]]'s 1986 hit \"[[We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off]].\"<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1007028/soundtrack IMDB \u2013 Zack and Miri make a Porno \u2013 Soundtrack]</ref>\n\n==Home media==\nAlthough some copies of the February 2009 \"2-Disc Edition\" [[DVD]] were originally released under its full intended title in the United States, some DVDs were released under ''Zack and Miri'', the censored title used to originally promote the film.
