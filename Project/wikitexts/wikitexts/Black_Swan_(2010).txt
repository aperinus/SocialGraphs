The film stars [[Natalie Portman]], [[Vincent Cassel]], [[Mila Kunis]], [[Barbara Hershey]], and [[Winona Ryder]], and revolves around a production of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Swan Lake]]'' by the [[New York City Ballet]] company. The production requires a ballerina to play the innocent and fragile White Swan, for which the committed dancer Nina Sayers (Portman) is a perfect fit, as well as the dark and sensual Black Swan, which are qualities better embodied by the new rival Lily (Kunis). Nina is overwhelmed by a feeling of immense pressure when she finds herself competing for the role, causing her to lose her tenuous grip on reality and descend into madness.\n\nAronofsky conceived the premise by connecting his viewings of a production of ''Swan Lake'' with an unrealized screenplay about understudies and the notion of being haunted by a double, similar to the folklore surrounding doppelg\u00e4ngers. Aronofsky cites [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[The Double (Dostoevsky novel)|The Double]]'' as another inspiration for the film. The director also considered ''Black Swan'' a companion piece to his 2008 film ''[[The Wrestler (2008 film)|The Wrestler]]'', with both films involving demanding performances for different kinds of art. He and Portman first discussed the project in 2000, and after a brief attachment to [[Universal Pictures]], ''Black Swan'' was produced in New York City in 2009 by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]]. Portman and Kunis trained in ballet for several months before filming began.\n\n''Black Swan'' premiered at the [[67th Venice International Film Festival]] on September 1, 2010, and had a [[limited release]] in the United States starting on December 3, before opening in [[wide release]] on December 17. Upon its release, the film received critical acclaim, with particular praise toward Aronofsky's direction and the performances of Portman and Kunis. It was also a commercial success, grossing $329 million worldwide against a $13 million budget. The film received five nominations at the [[83rd Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], with Portman winning [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]; it also received four nominations at the [[68th Golden Globe Awards]], including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]], with Portman winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Actress]]. In 2021, Portman's performance was included in ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'}}s list of the best film performances of the 21st century.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Brody |first1=Richard |title=The Best Movie Performances of the Century So Far |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/the-best-movie-performances-of-the-century-so-far |access-date=March 8, 2021 |magazine=The New Yorker |date=March 6, 2021 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20210306161800/https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/the-best-movie-performances-of-the-century-so-far |archive-date=March 6, 2021 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nNina Sayers, a young ballerina with the [[New York City Ballet]] company, lives with her overprotective mother, Erica, herself a former dancer. The company is opening the season with [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Swan Lake]]''. After forcing prima ballerina Elizabeth \"Beth\" MacIntyre into retirement, artistic director Thomas Leroy announces he is looking for a new dancer for the dual roles of the innocent and fragile White Swan Odette and the sensual and dark Black Swan Odile. Nina auditions for the roles and gives a flawless rehearsal as Odette, but fails to embody Odile.\n\nThe next day, Nina asks Thomas to reconsider her role. When he forcibly kisses her, she bites him and runs out of his office. Later that day, Nina sees the cast list and discovers to her surprise she has received the lead roles. At a gala celebrating the new season, an intoxicated Beth accuses Nina of providing sexual favors to Thomas in return for a promotion. The next day, Nina hears Beth was hit by a car; Thomas believes Beth was attempting suicide. Nina visits an unconscious Beth in the hospital and sees, much to her shock, that her legs have been severely injured, meaning she will be unable to perform as a ballet dancer ever again.\n\nDuring rehearsals, Thomas tells Nina to observe a newcomer, Lily, who has a physical resemblance to Nina but also an uninhibited quality Nina lacks. Nina has hallucinations and finds scratch marks on her back.\n\nOne night, despite Erica's objection, Nina accepts Lily's invitation to go out for drinks. Lily offers Nina an [[MDMA|ecstasy]] capsule, saying it would help her relax. Nina turns it down at first, but then accepts. She repeats Lily's assurance that the effects will only last for a few hours, and quickly begins to act under the ecstasy's influence. Nina flirts with men at the bar and Lily as well. The two dance at a nightclub and return to Nina's apartment late that night. After arguing with her mother, Nina barricades herself in her room and Lily performs oral sex on her. The next morning, she wakes up alone and realizes that she is late for the dress rehearsal.\n\nUpon arriving at [[Lincoln Center]], Nina sees Lily dancing as Odile and confronts her about their night together. She seems confused by Nina's insinuation that they had sex and denies going home with Nina, saying she went home with one of the men from the bar. Nina becomes convinced Lily intends to take her place, especially after learning that Thomas has made Lily her alternate. Nina's hallucinations grow stronger and her injuries increase, going as far as hallucinating herself transforming into Odile. On opening night, she shouts to her mother, \"I'm the swan queen, you're the one who never left the [[Corps de ballet|corps]]!\", after her mother tells her she called the theater and told them Nina was not well enough to perform and tries to convince Nina that the role has been too much for her. As Nina is late, Lily is prepared to replace her. Nina confronts Thomas, who is impressed by her newfound confidence and allows her to take back her roles.\n\nTowards the end of the ballet's second act, Nina is distracted by another hallucination and loses her stability as Odette. This causes the male dancer playing the prince to drop her on stage, which  infuriates Thomas. She returns to her dressing room and finds Lily preparing as Odile. During a confrontation, Lily transforms into Nina. The two fight, breaking a mirror. Nina stabs her doppelg\u00e4nger with a large shard of glass from the mirror, killing her. The body reverts to Lily. Nina hides the corpse in the bathroom, and takes the stage, dancing flawlessly as Odile and seemingly turns into a black swan, her arms covered in feathers. Amidst a standing ovation from the audience, Nina surprises Thomas with a passionate kiss and returns to her dressing room.\n\nAs Nina resumes the Odette tutu and white swan makeup, she hears a knock at her door. She opens it to find Lily alive. Lily apologizes for the misunderstandings and congratulates her before taking her leave. Confused, Nina sees the mirror is still broken; but the towel she used to mop up the blood is clean{{snd}}there is no corpse. She looks down and pulls a piece of glass from her abdomen, realizing she stabbed herself{{snd}}not Lily.\n\nNina dances the final act of the ballet, which ends with Odette throwing herself off a cliff and Nina landing on a mattress. The theater erupts in thunderous applause while Thomas, Lily, and the others gather to congratulate Nina, who remains lying on the mattress. Thomas sees the blood spreading at her waist and shouts for help. He frantically asks Nina what happened to her. Nina calmly replies that she was perfect as the screen fades to white.\n\n==Cast==\nDuring the closing credits, the major cast members are credited both as their film characters as well as their corresponding characters from ''[[Swan Lake]]''.\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as Nina Sayers/White Swan/Odette\n* [[Mila Kunis]] as Lily/Black Swan/Odile\n* [[Vincent Cassel]] as Thomas Leroy/The Gentleman\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Erica Sayers/The Queen\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as Elizabeth \"Beth\" MacIntyre/The Dying Swan\n* [[Benjamin Millepied]] as David Moreau/Prince Siegfried\n* [[Ksenia Solo]] as Veronica/Little Swan\n* [[Kristina Anapau]] as Galina/Little Swan\n* [[Janet Montgomery]] as Madeline/Little Swan\n* [[Sebastian Stan]] as Andrew/Suitor\n* [[Toby Hemingway]] as Tom/Suitor\n* Sergio Torrado as Sergio/Von Rothbart\n* [[Mark Margolis]] as Mr. Fithian/Patron\n* [[Tina Sloan]] as Mrs. Fithian/Patron\n\n==Production==\n===Conception===\n[[File:Wiener Staatsoper Schwanensee Szene Akt3a.jpg|alt=A photograph of a performance of Swan Lake during the third act, with the protagonist transformed into the Black Swan|thumb|left|The scene from the ballet ''Swan Lake'' in which the Black Swan (Odile) tricks and seduces the Prince]]\n[[Darren Aronofsky]] first became interested in ballet when his sister studied dance at the [[High School of Performing Arts]] in New York City.
