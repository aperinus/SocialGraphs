The [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|40th animated film produced by the studio]], it was directed by [[Mark Dindal]], from a screenplay by [[David Reynolds (screenwriter)|David Reynolds]] and a story by [[Chris Williams (director)|Chris Williams]] and Dindal. The voice cast features [[David Spade]], [[John Goodman]], [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Patrick Warburton]], and [[Wendie Malick]]. Inspired by ancient Peruvian culture and set in an [[Incan]] empire, ''The Emperor's New Groove'' follows young and self-centered [[Emperor Kuzco]] (voiced by Spade), who is accidentally transformed into a [[llama]] by his ex-advisor, [[Yzma]] (Kitt), and her dim-witted henchman and sidekick, [[List of The Emperor's New Groove characters#Kronk|Kronk]] (Warburton). For the emperor to change back into a human, he entrusts a village leader, [[Pacha (character)|Pacha]] (Goodman), to escort him back to the palace before Yzma can track them down and finish him off.\n\nDevelopment of ''The Emperor's New Groove'' began in 1994, when the film was conceived as a [[Musical film|musical]] [[Epic film|epic]] titled ''Kingdom of the Sun''. Following his directorial debut with ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994), [[Roger Allers]] recruited English musician [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] to compose several songs for the film. Because of the underwhelming box-office performances of ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' (1995) and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1996), Dindal was brought in as co-director to make the film more comedic.<ref name=\"KingdomoftheSun\">{{cite news|last=Hill|first=Jim|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040902115852/http://www.laughingplace.com/News-PID115140-115141.asp|url=http://www.laughingplace.com/News-PID115140-115142.asp|title=The Long Story Behind the Emperor's New Groove|website=The Laughing Place|date=May 25, 2001|archive-date=September 2, 2004|access-date=February 8, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Because of poor test screenings, creative differences with Dindal, and production falling behind schedule, Allers departed, and the film became a lighthearted comedy in the vein of a [[Chuck Jones]] cartoon instead of a dramatic musical. A documentary, ''[[The Sweatbox]]'' (2002), details the production troubles that ''The Emperor's New Groove'' endured during its six years' development.\n\n''The Emperor's New Groove'' was released to theaters on December 15, 2000. It performed disappointingly at the box office compared to Disney films released in the 1990s, grossing $169.5&nbsp;million on a $100-million budget.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2014/01/13/top-5-underrated-disney-cartoons/|title=Top 5 Underrated Disney Cartoons|last=Mendelson|first=Scott|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=January 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129010031/https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2014/01/13/top-5-underrated-disney-cartoons/|archive-date=January 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> However, the film found larger success when it was released for home media, and became the best-selling [[DVD-Video|DVD]] of 2001. It received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised it for its writing, animation, humor and voice cast (Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton often being singled out for praise), and as one of the best films released during Disney's post-[[Disney Renaissance|Renaissance]] era and the most comedic. It was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for the song \"[[My Funny Friend and Me]]\", performed by Sting; that award went to \"[[Things Have Changed]]\" by [[Bob Dylan]] from ''[[Wonder Boys (film)|Wonder Boys]]''. A [[direct-to-video]] sequel, ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'', was released in 2005, and an animated spin-off, ''[[The Emperor's New School]]'', aired on the [[Disney Channel]] from 2006 to 2008.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions -->\n[[Inca Empire|Incan emperor]] Kuzco is arrogant, entitled, and pampered, has no patience for the needs of others, especially peasants, and abuses his position of power. For his 18th birthday, Kuzco plans to demolish a local village to build a lavish summer mansion - \"Kuzcotopia\" - against the objections of the village's leader, Pacha. After he fires [[Yzma]], his conniving advisor, she plots to usurp the throne by poisoning Kuzco. Instead, she and her dimwitted but kindhearted assistant Kronk accidentally give him the wrong vial that transforms him into a [[llama]]. Yzma orders Kronk to knock Kuzco unconscious, then dispose of him, but a stroke of conscience prevents Kronk from doing the latter.\n\nKuzco is inadvertently taken by Pacha to his village, where he orders Pacha to take him back to the palace. Pacha refuses to help Kuzco unless he changes his mind and builds Kuzcotopia elsewhere. Confused, Kuzco heads off to the jungle alone and is attacked by a pack of [[jaguar]]s. Pacha arrives in time to rescue Kuzco, who reluctantly accepts Pacha's terms to escort him home. While initially at odds, the two learn to cooperate and earn one another's good side. Meanwhile, Yzma, now empress, learns that Kronk did not eliminate Kuzco and sets out to find him. The duos arrive at an eatery at the same time, completely unaware of the others' presence. Pacha overhears Yzma's plans and Kronk nearly recognizes Pacha. When Pacha tries to warn Kuzco about Yzma, Kuzco brushes him off, causing Pacha to leave, only to then overhear Yzma's machinations about himself.\n\nAlone, lost, and realizing no one in the empire misses him because of his selfishness, Kuzco glumly resigns himself to the life of a llama, but comes across Pacha and the two reconcile. Meanwhile, Kronk finally recalls Pacha and his connection to Kuzco. He and Yzma await them at Pacha's home, posing as distant family members. Pacha has his family delay Yzma, giving him and Kuzco a headstart back to the capital. They reach Yzma's secret lab to grab some potions and encounter a furious Yzma about to kill Kuzco. While fleeing Yzma and the palace guards, Kuzco attempts all the potions until there are two left; Yzma accidentally lands on one of the two and turns into a small cat. Despite the transformation, she, Kuzco and Pacha struggle for the final vial, but Yzma is unexpectedly foiled by Kronk, and Kuzco drinks it, finally reverting him to his human form.\n\nNow completely changed, Kuzco makes amends with those he offended and regains his throne, while also opting to build his summer home, a modest shack, on an unoccupied hill next to Pacha's house. Elsewhere, Kronk has become a scout leader and trains new recruits how to speak squirrel, including the reluctant Yzma, who remains in cat form while serving in Kronk's troop.\n\n==Voice cast== \n{{Main|List of The Emperor's New Groove characters}}\n* [[David Spade]] as Emperor Kuzco, the entitled, pampered, and arrogant 18-year-old emperor of the Inca Empire who has no patience for the needs of others and has a lack of compassion.\n* [[John Goodman]] as Pacha, a brave, loving, and respected village leader.\n* [[Eartha Kitt]] as Yzma, Kuzco's elderly and untrustworthy advisor who seeks Kuzco's throne for herself.\n* [[Patrick Warburton]] as Kronk, Yzma's friendly but slow-witted muscular henchman and sidekick.\n* [[Wendie Malick]] as Chicha, Pacha's supportive pregnant wife.\n* Kellyann Kelso and Eli Russell Linnetz as Chaca and Tipo respectively, Pacha and Chicha's two young, mischievous children.\n* [[Bob Bergen]] as Bucky the Squirrel, Kronk's companion, who hates Yzma, and has an unpleasant encounter with Kuzco; and as Fly stuck in web.\n* [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] as the Theme Song Guy, Kuzco's personal theme song conductor.\n* [[Patti Deutsch]] as Mata, a waitress at Mudka's Meat Hut.\n* [[John Fiedler]] as Rudy, a well-meaning old man who is first thrown out a window by Kuzco's guards, then later befriends him.\n* [[Joe Whyte]] as the Royal Recordkeeper.\n* [[Jack Angel]], Danny Mann, [[Rodger Bumpass]], [[Paul Eiding]], and [[Patrick Pinney]] as Male Villagers/Additional Voices.\n* [[Sherry Lynn]], [[Jennifer Darling]], and Mickie McGowan as Female Villagers/Additional Voices.\n* [[Jess Harnell]] as the Guard who throws Rudy out the window and Additional Voices.\n* [[Rodger Bumpass]] as one of the Guards who got turned into a cow.\n* [[Steve Susskind]] as an Irate Chef, a former chef at Mudka's Meat Hut who quits due to Kuzco and Kronk.\n* [[Miriam Flynn]] as the Pi\u00f1ata Lady.\n* [[Jim Cummings]] and [[Kath Soucie]] as Birthday Singers.\n* [[Andre Stojka]] and [[Robert Clotworthy]] as Topo and Ipi, two of Pacha's villagers.\n\n==Production==\n===''Kingdom of the Sun''===\n{{Quote box|width =30em|quote=\"''Kingdom of the Sun'' was such a heart-breaking experience for me.
