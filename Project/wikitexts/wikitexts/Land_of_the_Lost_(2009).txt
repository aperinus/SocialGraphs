The film was theatrically released on June 5, 2009 by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]].\n\nThe film received generally negative reviews from critics and was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing just $68 million against its $100 million budget. It received seven [[Golden Raspberry Award]] nominations, including [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]], winning [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel]].\n\n==Plot==\nPompous [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] Rick Marshall has a low-level job at the [[La Brea Tar Pits]], three years after a disastrous interview with [[Matt Lauer]] on ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' went [[viral video|viral]] and ruined his career. [[Doctorate|Doctoral candidate]] from [[Cambridge]] Holly Cantrell tells him that his [[fringe science|controversial theories]] combining [[time warp (science fiction)|time warps]] and paleontology inspired her.\n\nShe shows him a fossil with an imprint of a cigarette lighter that he recognizes as his own, along with a crystal made into a necklace that gives off strong [[tachyon]] energy. She convinces him to finish his tachyon amplifier and go on an expedition to the cave where Holly found the fossil, in the desert.\n\nThey raft into the cave, with cave gift shop owner Will Stanton, where Marshall detects high levels of tachyons. Activating the tachyon amplifier triggers an earthquake, opening a time warp the raft falls into. They find themselves in an inter-dimensional desert, filled with items from many eras, and without the amplifier. They rescue Cha-Ka, a Pakuni (a primate-like creature), who becomes their friend and guide.\n\nThey spend a night in a cave after surviving a meeting with a fast and intelligent ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' they nickname \"Grumpy\", who develops a grudge against Marshall for calling him \"stupid\". Marshall receives a telepathic message begging for help and finds himself in ancient ruins. They encounter a race of [[List of reptilian humanoids|lizard men]] called [[List of Land of the Lost characters and species#Sleestak|Sleestaks]] before meeting Enik the Altrusian (who sent the message). Exiled by the Zarn, who wants to take over Earth with his Sleestak minions, Enik can prevent the invasion if Marshall gets the tachyon amplifier.\n\nThe group stumbles across a desert with many things from across time, encountering many ''[[Compsognathus]]'', [[Dromaeosauridae|Dromaeosaurs]], Grumpy, and a female ''[[Allosaurus]]'' nicknamed \"Big Alice\". These last two are battling it out over a dead ice-cream seller, who was killed by the ''Compsognathus'' and Dromaeosaurs, until they sense Marshall and chase him. Marshall kills Big Alice with [[liquid nitrogen]], finding the amplifier was eaten by the ''Allosaurus''. A ''[[Pteranodon]]'' then steals it, taking it to its nest. Marshall lightly steps through the pterosaur eggs to retrieve the amplifier in the nest. When he reaches it, it stops playing the music (Marshall's favorite musical ''[[A Chorus Line]]''). The eggs begin to hatch, and they realize the music was keeping the baby pterosaurs asleep. Marshall, Will and Holly belt out \"[[I Hope I Get It]]\", with Cha-Ka joining in, displaying a great singing voice, much to Marshall's surprise. (As well as the viewers').\n\nMarshall, Will and Cha-Ka celebrate, Holly takes a dinosaur egg and learns from a recording left by the long-deceased Zarn that Enik is lying (he is the one planning the Earth invasion). She is captured by the Sleestaks, and brought to the Library of Skulls for judgment. The others save her, but the villain, with the amplifier, and controlling the Sleestaks, leaves to open a portal to Earth.\n\nMarshall pole vaults into Grumpy's mouth and (after removing an intestinal blockage), finally befriends him. He joins the others to defeat the Sleestak army and confront Enik. After the crystal link between the Land of the Lost and Earth is shattered, Enik reveals the portal will close forever. Thinking fast, Marshall grabs Holly's crystal, inserting it into the port. Knowing the substitute crystal won't hold for long, they leave quickly. Will chooses to stay, learning later that female Pakuni are very attractive.\n\nA triumphant Marshall reappears on ''Today'' with the dinosaur egg Holly brought back, promoting his new book ''\"Matt Lauer Can Suck It!\"''. The egg left behind on the ''Today'' set hatches a baby Sleestak, which hisses as the screen goes black.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Dr. Rick Marshall, a renowned paleontologist and author, determined to prove his theory on time warps, thus embarking on a time travel experiment.\n* [[Anna Friel]] as Holly Cantrell, a doctoral candidate from [[Cambridge]], and Rick's biggest fan.\n* [[Danny McBride]] as Will Stanton, a gift shop owner who takes Holly and Rick to a tachyon-rich cave.\n* [[Jorma Taccone]] as Cha-Ka, a Pakuni who befriends Rick, Holly, and Will.\n* [[John Boylan (Canadian actor)|John Boylan]] as Enik, an Altrusian who plans to invade and conquer Earth, and deceives Rick and the others into believing otherwise; he also controls the Sleestak.\n* [[Matt Lauer]] as Himself\n* [[Ben Best]] as Ernie\n* [[Leonard Nimoy]] as the voice of The Zarn\n* [[Douglas Tait (actor)|Douglas Tait]] as Sleestak\n* [[Landon Ashworth]] as Sleestak\n\nThe original actors who played Holly and Will in the TV series, [[Kathy Coleman]] and [[Wesley Eure]], filmed [[Cameo appearance|cameo]]s for the film.<ref name=\"today\">{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/id/31171550#.Uq4ZevRdXxU |title=Catching up with the stars of 'Land of the Lost' - Entertainment |publisher=TODAY.com |date=2009-06-08 |access-date=2013-12-15}}</ref> However, the final version of the film cut these scenes.<ref name=\"today\" /> [[Bobb'e J.

The majority of the first two seasons were also made available on [[Hulu]]. Ahead of the film's release, Universal also released the complete series on DVD; it had previously been released by [[Rhino Home Video]]. The entire series is also available via download from [[Xbox Live]]. Two different games were released online to promote the film. \"Chakker\" was available to play on the film's official Web site while \"Crystal Adventure\" was a free downloadable game for iPhones from Kewlbox. Both [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] and [[MapQuest]] hosted an online sweepstakes on their respective Web sites with various movie-related merchandise given away as prizes. Both sweepstakes ran from May 18 through June 7 of 2009.

However parts of the song \"[[The Right to Go Insane]]\", from the 2009 album ''[[Endgame (Megadeth album)|Endgame]]'', can be heard near the end of the film. In the film, Rick Marshall sings the original ''Land of the Lost'' theme and two other tracks (Tracks 5 and 27) utilize parts of the theme as well., The musical ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' plays a part in the story, and Ferrell sings [[Cher]]'s 1998 dance pop hit \"[[Believe (Cher song)|Believe]]\". [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] released the soundtrack album on June 9, 2009 (tracks 30-32 are bonus tracks).\n\n==Differences from original series==\nThe film serves as a [[parody]] of the original TV series, similar to ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]]'' and ''[[Starsky & Hutch (film)|Starsky & Hutch]]''. In the original series, the main characters were the father and two children. While the first names remain the same, the film converts the Holly character into an unrelated research assistant to allow for more risque humor because she is the main character's love interest.<ref>{{cite magazine |last = Stevens |first = Dana |title = Dumb Summer Guy Movies: The Hangover and Land of the Lost attempt to amuse dudes everywhere. |magazine = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date = 2009-06-04 |url = http://www.slate.com/id/2219773/ |access-date = 2009-06-05}}</ref>  Will, instead of being a son, is an amusement park operator and [[Survivalism|survivalist]].<ref>{{cite news |author = Tom Long |url = http://www.detnews.com/article/20090605/OPINION03/906050346/Will-Ferrell-hits-an-all-time-low-with-lame--Land-of-the-Lost- |title = Will Ferrell hits an all-time low with lame 'Land of the Lost' |work = [[The Detroit News]] |date = 2009-06-05 |access-date = 2009-06-05 }}</ref>  Rick Marshall is a paleontologist in the film, not a park ranger as in the original series.
