It stars [[Christian Bale]] as the title character, a [[machinist]] struggling with guilt, [[paranoia]], and delusion after being unable to sleep for an entire year. [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], [[Aitana S\u00e1nchez-Gij\u00f3n]], [[John Sharian]], and [[Michael Ironside]] appear in supporting roles.\n\nThe film drew attention due to Bale's commitment, having lost {{convert|62|lb|kg}} in preparation for his role. Upon release, ''The Machinist'' was well received by critics, with praise for Bale's performance, and grossed $8.2 million on a $5 million budget. In later years it has gained a [[Cult film|cult status]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-11-20 |title=The Best Movie You Never Saw: The Machinist |url=https://www.joblo.com/the-best-movie-you-never-saw-the-machinist-280-02/ |access-date=2022-07-05 |website=JoBlo |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nTrevor Reznik is a [[machinist]] whose [[insomnia]] has led to him becoming [[Emaciation|emaciated]]. His appearance and behavior keep his coworkers away, and they eventually turn against him when he is involved in an accident, which causes his coworker, Miller, to lose his left arm. Trevor, who was distracted by an unfamiliar coworker named Ivan, is blamed for the accident. No one at the factory knows of Ivan and there are no records of him. Trevor seems to find comfort in the arms of Stevie, a [[prostitution|prostitute]] with genuine affection for him, and with Maria, a waitress at an airport diner he frequents. He is haunted by brief flashes of recurring imagery, and things such as his car cigarette lighter take on a [[Panphobia|menacing air]]. A mysterious series of post-it notes appear on his refrigerator, depicting a game of [[Hangman (game)|hangman]].\n\nThese vague incidents send him further into paranoia, but he nonetheless attempts to establish a relationship with Maria. Meeting her at an amusement park, Trevor goes with her son Nicholas on a [[dark ride]] called \"Route 666\". The ride starts as a harmless scare ride, but begins to show increasingly disturbing images as it advances, until its flashing lights cause Nicholas to suffer an [[Photosensitive epilepsy|epileptic]] seizure. No longer able to think clearly, Trevor suspects that the bizarre events are a concerted effort to drive him insane, as do recurring clues such as a photo of Ivan fishing with Trevor's coworker Reynolds, which he discovers in Ivan's wallet when Ivan leaves it unattended in a pub. Another near-accident at work causes Trevor to lash out in rage at his coworkers; as a result, he is immediately fired. Increasingly distracted and alienated, Trevor forgets to pay his utility bills and his electricity is disconnected. A dark, viscous liquid begins trickling out of the freezer, coating the refrigerator door with streaks of what appears to be blood.\n\nAfter several attempts to confront Ivan, Trevor tries to trace his license plate, but runs out of gas while in pursuit of his car. When a [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]] clerk insists that personal information cannot be released unless a crime has been committed, Trevor throws himself in front of a car in order to accuse Ivan of committing a [[Hit and run (vehicular)|hit and run]]. He files a police report with Ivan's plate number, only to be baffled when he is told that the car in question is his own, and that he had reported it totaled one year ago. He flees the police and goes to Stevie, who bathes and clothes him, but he is disturbed by the discovery of the photo of Ivan and Reynolds framed in her home. Trevor accuses her of conspiring against him. Confused, Stevie says the picture is of Reynolds and Trevor, but he refuses to look at it, and after a violent argument, Stevie throws him out. He goes to the airport diner, but is told by an unfamiliar waitress that they've never had an employee named Maria. The waitress at the counter tells Trevor she has served him every day for a year, and, in all that time, he spoke so little that she thought he was [[muteness|mute]].\n\nTrevor sees Ivan take Nicholas into Trevor's apartment and, fearing the worst, sneaks inside. Nicholas is nowhere to be seen and doesn't respond to Trevor's calls. He confronts Ivan in the bathroom and kills him after a struggle. He pulls back the shower curtain, only to find the bathtub empty. He goes to the refrigerator and opens it to find rotting fish, matching those in the fishing photo, which he at last realizes was of himself with Reynolds, just as Stevie claimed; Trevor hallucinated Ivan's presence in the photo. Trevor now remembers taking a rolled-up carpet containing what he thought was Ivan's body to the ocean to dispose of it, only for the rug to become unrolled and reveal nothing inside. A figure holding a flashlight who approached Trevor from behind turns out to be Ivan, who laughs as he tells Trevor that he has some explaining to do.\n\nTrevor stares into a mirror at home, repeating the words, \"I know who you are.\" It is revealed that one year prior, a then-healthy Trevor ran over and killed a boy (identical to Nicholas) after taking his eyes off the road to use the car's cigarette lighter, which was witnessed by the boy's mother (identical to Maria). Trevor fled the scene in his car, and the resulting guilt became the root of his insomnia, emaciation and repressed memories. Ivan was a figment of Trevor's imagination and a manifestation of himself before the accident. He fills the missing letters on the hangman note, spelling out \"killer\". He briefly considers going to the airport to escape, but instead drives to police headquarters. He is accompanied by a silent but encouraging Ivan, who bids him an approving farewell outside the station as he enters and confesses to the hit-and-run. Two police officers escort Trevor to a cell, where after stating that he only wants to sleep, he does, for the first time in a year.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Christian Bale]] as Trevor Reznik\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Stevie\n* [[John Sharian]] as Ivan\n* [[Aitana S\u00e1nchez-Gij\u00f3n]] as Maria\n* [[Michael Ironside]] as Miller\n* [[Lawrence Gilliard Jr.]] as Jackson (as Larry Gilliard)\n* [[Reg E.

It was produced by the ''Fantastic Factory'' label of Filmax and Castelao Productions.\n\n[[Christian Bale]] strenuously dieted for over four months prior to filming, as his character needed to look drastically thin. According to a biography of Bale written by his former assistant, this daily diet consisted of \"[[water]], an [[apple]] and one cup of [[coffee]] per day, with the occasional [[Whisky|whiskey]]\" (approximately 55\u2013260 calories).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/30/christian-bale-biography-batman-titanic_n_1557666.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000003 | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | title=Christian Bale Was Almost In 'Titanic' | date=30 May 2012}}</ref> According to the DVD [[Audio commentary|commentary]], he lost {{convert|62|lb|kg}}, reducing his body weight to {{convert|120|lb|kg}}.

The photography by Xavi Gimenez and Charlie Jiminez is cold slates, blues and grays, the palate of despair. We see Trevor's world so clearly through his eyes that only gradually does it occur to us that every life is seen through a filter. We get up in the morning in possession of certain assumptions through which all of our experiences must filter. We cannot be rid of those assumptions, although an evolved person can at least try to take them into account. Most people never question their assumptions, and so reality exists for them as they think it does, whether it does or not. Some assumptions are necessary to make life bearable, such as the assumption that we will not die in the next 10 minutes. Others may lead us, as they lead Trevor, into a bleak solitude. Near the end of the movie, we understand him when he simply says, 'I just want to sleep.'\"<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=A character on thin ice |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-machinist-2004 |website=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |publisher=RogerEbert.com |date=November 18, 2004}} {{Rating|3|4}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Spanish films of 2004]]\n* [[Fatal insomnia]] and [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] - Real diseases that may have inspired the plot of this film\n* [[Insomnia (2002 film)|''Insomnia'' (2002 film)]]\n* [[A Beautiful Mind (film)|''A Beautiful Mind'' (film)]]\n* [[Memento (film)|''Memento'' (film)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0361862|The Machinist}}\n* {{mojo title|machinist|The Machinist}}\n\n{{Brad Anderson}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Machinist, The}}\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2000s thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:2004 independent films]]\n[[Category:2004 psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:Spanish drama films]]\n[[Category:Spanish thriller films]]\n[[Category:English-language Spanish films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Brad Anderson]]\n[[Category:Fiction with unreliable narrators]]\n[[Category:Films set in factories]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Barcelona]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Spain]]\n[[Category:Spanish independent films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Vantage films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Roque Ba\u00f1os]]\n[[Category:Filmax films]]\n[[Category:Castelao Producciones films]]\n[[Category:Insomnia in film]]\n[[Category:2004 drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s Spanish films]]"}]}}}}
