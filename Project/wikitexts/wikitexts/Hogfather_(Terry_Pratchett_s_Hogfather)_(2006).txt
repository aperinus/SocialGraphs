First aired in two 1.5-hour episodes on 17 and 18 December 2006 at 20:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], it was the first live-action film adaptation of a ''[[Discworld]]'' novel. In 2007, the two episodes were [[rerun]] on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day respectively on [[Sky1|Sky One]] and Sky1 HD.\n\n''Hogfather'' won the Interactivity Award at the 2007 [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA TV Awards]] for its use of the interactive options available on [[digital television]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe series closely follows the plot of [[Hogfather#Plot summary|the novel]], in which the Hogfather, the [[Discworld (world)|Discworld]] equivalent of [[Father Christmas]], has gone missing and [[Death (Discworld)|Death]] is forced to take his place while Death's granddaughter [[Susan Sto Helit|Susan]] attempts to find out what happened.\n\n==Main cast==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Although not named in the original book or the script, Pratchett decided the toymaker was named Joshua Isme, and his shop was Toys Is Me (a play on [[Toys R Us]]). The set dressing for the toyshop included appropriate labels.\n\nThe [[Death (Discworld)#The Death of Rats|Death of Rats]] was credited as played by \"Dorckey Hellmice\", an anagram of \"Michelle Dockery\".\n\nBoth Nigel Planer, who plays Sideney and the voice of the Auditors, and Tony Robinson, who plays Mr Crumley, have been the readers for many of the audiobook editions of the Discworld novels, and have both had voice acting roles in the Discworld video games.\n\nIan Richardson also played [[Francis Urquhart]] in the BBC series ''[[House of Cards (UK TV series)|House of Cards]];'' Death's line to Albert, {{smallcaps|You may think I've already thought of that, but I could not possibly comment}}, mirrors a similar phrase of Urquhart's. This would be his last role on television shown before his death.\n\nDavid Jason would later go on to play [[Rincewind]] in the adaptation of ''[[Terry Pratchett's The Colour of Magic|The Colour of Magic]]''.\n\n== Production ==\n===Development===\nThe [[storyboard]]ing for the film was by artist [[Stephen Briggs]], who drew ''[[The Streets of Ankh-Morpork]]'' and ''[[The Discworld Mapp]]''. [[Bernard Pearson]] was involved with the 'look' of [[Ankh-Morpork]].<ref>Statements by Pearson at Discworld Convention 2006</ref> Some interior and exterior scenes were shot in Spring 2005 at [[Sutton House, London|Sutton House]], [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], with extensive use of artificial snow to create winter.\n\n===Writing===\nThough the film was quite faithful to the novel, even in script, there were a few changes. The [[Death of Rats]] is reduced to a one-scene cameo in the film where it reaps the soul of a mouse caught in a trap on Hogswatchnight, and then watches Death deliver presents, whereas in the novel it appears much more often with [[Quoth The Raven#Quoth|Quoth the Raven]]. The invasion of the tooth castle is covered in more detail in the movie, as is the gathering and controlling of the teeth. The annihilation of two of Teatime's associates were removed; thus, instead of Sideney being caught in the playground of his old elementary school (with curls), he was killed by the Scissor Man, and Catseye's fear of the dark is given to Mr. Brown. The Cheerful Fairy and the Towel Wasp are both removed, along with any mention of the Money Bag Goblin by [[Dean (education)|the Dean]]. Mention of Bibulous, the opposite brother of Bilious, is removed, and so is the Hangover Imp that is pounding Bilious' head in the scene where Susan meets him. Medium Dave and Banjo's surname in the novel is 'Lilywhite', not 'Cropper', although Teatime refers to Medium Dave as 'Mr. Lilywhite' while threatening him in the tower, and Mr. Brown refers to their mother as 'Ma Lilywhite'. 'Chickenwire' is the character's surname in the film as opposed to a nickname in the book.\n\nThe line {{smallcaps|You might think I've already thought of that, but I could not possibly comment}} was added to Death's dialogue with Albert in the movie. It is iconically associated with [[Francis Urquhart]], the protagonist of ''[[House of Cards (British TV series)|House of Cards]]'' played by Death's voice actor, [[Ian Richardson]].\n\n=== Special effects ===\nThe [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] for the show was done by [[Moving Picture Company]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n=== Promotion===\nThe film premiered at the Curzon Cinema in [[Mayfair]] on Monday 27 November 2006. Part 1 and a teaser for part 2 were shown.\n\nBeginning the second week of December, Sky began using a new Christmas ident for Sky One, [[Sky2|Two]] and [[Sky3|Three]], featuring the Hogfather's sleigh and the message \"Happy Hogswatch\". The song \"[[Santa Claus Is Coming to Town]]\" was used on Hogfather radio advertisements with the word \"Hogfather\" replacing \"[[Santa Claus]]\".  A \"making of\" documentary entitled ''The Whole Hog'' was shown on Sky One on the 10th. The film was shown on the 17 and 18 December on Sky One, and was repeated shortly afterwards on Christmas Day and [[Boxing Day]].\n\n==International broadcast==\nThe film has been aired in numerous countries. In December 2007, Australia's [[Seven Network]] aired the film across two nights, on 23 and 24 December. French network [[M6 (TV channel)|M6]] aired both parts (as {{lang|fr|Les Contes du Disque-Monde}} (''Tales of the [[Discworld]]'') on Christmas Eve 2007, while Germany's [[ProSieben]] and the United States' [[Ion Television|ION]] doing the same (with the original title) on Christmas Day. It was also released on DVD in a two-tiered scheme in the US, being sold exclusively at [[Borders Group|Borders Book stores]] from 18 November 2007 to 3 March 2008, when it was released wide. None of the extras from the British limited edition DVD are included, the only extras being an interview with Terry Pratchett and the original trailer.\n\n== Home media ==\n''Terry Pratchett's Hogfather'' was released on DVD in the UK (R2) on 23 April 2007 in both standard and limited-edition packaging. The DVD is dedicated to the memory of Ian Richardson, who died shortly after the programme was broadcast. The making of the Hogfather is also available on [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] as a free video podcast.\n\nThe limited-edition release is a two-disc set, with an individually numbered case and signed card from Terry Pratchett. The second disc contains special features, including:\n\n*Deleted Scenes\n**Bilious (the oh god of Hangovers) introducing and explaining himself to Susan\n**Death and Albert discovering the altered Hogswatch card\n**Further explanation on the role of the ancient Hogfather\n*12 Days of Hogswatch (Death's Guide to Discworld)\n**A series of four 1\u20132-minute featurettes in which Death interviews Terry Pratchett, Stephen Briggs and others to explain various aspects of Discworld.
