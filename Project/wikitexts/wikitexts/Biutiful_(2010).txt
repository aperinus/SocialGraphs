The project marks Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's first film in his native [[Spanish language]] since his debut feature ''[[Amores perros]]'' (2000). [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]] and [[Guillermo del Toro]] (who make up \"The Three Amigos\" with Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu in the film industry) serve as associate producers. The film follows Uxbal, a criminal and father who becomes diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] and seeks to settle various things around his life before he dies. The title is in reference to the [[Phonology|phonetic]] spelling in Spanish of the English word ''beautiful''.\n\n''Biutiful'' premiered at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]], and was released theatrically by Videocine in Mexico and [[United International Pictures]] in Spain on 22 October 2010 and 3 December, respectively. The film received mixed reviews from critics, and was a [[box-office bomb]] grossing $24.7 million worldwide on a budget of $35 million. It was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]] in 2011: [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Bardem; his nomination was the first entirely Spanish-language performance to be nominated for the award. Bardem also received the [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor Award]] at Cannes for his work on the film.\n\n==Plot==\nUxbal lives in a shabby apartment in [[Barcelona]] with his two young children, Ana and Mateo. He is separated from their mother Marambra, an [[alcoholic]] prostitute with [[bipolar disorder]]. Having grown up an orphan, Uxbal has no family other than his brother Tito, who works in the construction business (and sometimes solicits Marambra's services). Uxbal earns a living by procuring work for a group of Chinese [[illegal immigrant]]s who make forged designer goods which a group of African street vendors then sell. He also works as a medium to the dead, passing on messages from the recently deceased at wakes and funerals. When he is diagnosed with terminal [[prostate cancer]], leaving him with only a few months to live, his world progressively falls apart.\n\nUxbal initially begins [[chemotherapy]], but he later ends the treatment at the advice of his friend Bea, an [[alternative medicine|alternative healer]]. She gives him two black stones which she asks him to give his children before he dies. The group of Africans are brutally arrested by the police, despite Uxbal's regular payment of [[bribe]]s, because they also deal in drugs. When one of them is deported back to [[Senegal]], Uxbal offers his wife Ige and baby son a room in his apartment. Meanwhile, an attempt at reconciliation with Marambra fails when Uxbal realizes she cannot be trusted to look after their children. As the Chinese are out of work, Tito brokers a deal to get them employed at a construction site. However, almost all of them die in the night from carbon monoxide poisoning, as the cheap gas heaters Uxbal bought in an effort to help were not safe. An attempt by a [[human trafficking|human trafficker]] to dump the bodies into the sea fails when they are washed up on the shore shortly after, causing a media sensation.\n\nAs Uxbal's health continues to deteriorate, he is plagued with guilt that he is responsible for the expulsion of the Senegalese and the death of the Chinese. With his death drawing nearer, he realizes that there will be nobody to take care of Ana and Mateo once he is gone. He entrusts the remainder of his savings to Ige, asking her to stay with the children after his death. She accepts his request but later decides to use the money to return to Africa. At the apartment, Uxbal sees Ige's silhouette behind the bathroom door and hears her voice saying she has returned. Uxbal lies down next to Ana and, after having passed on to her a diamond ring which his father had once given to his mother, he dies. In a [[Heaven|snowy winter landscape]] he is reunited with his father, who had died before Uxbal's birth shortly after having fled [[Francoist Spain]] for Mexico.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Javier Bardem]] as Uxbal\n* [[Luo Jin]] as Li Wei\n* [[Maricel \u00c1lvarez]] as Marambra\n* Hanaa Bouchaib as Ana\n* Guillermo Estrella as Mateo\n* Diaryatou Daff as Ige\n* Taishen Cheng as Hai\n* [[Nasser Saleh]] as Muchacho\n\n==Production==\n''Biutiful'' is formally recognised as a Mexico-Spanish co-production, even if US independent production companies also took part in the production.<ref name=\"tierney\">{{Cite book|page=72|chapter=Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu: Director without Borders|title=New Transnationalisms in Contemporary Latin American Cinemas|first=Dolores|last=Tierney|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=978-0-7486-4573-2}}</ref> It is a Menage Atroz, MOD Producciones, [[Focus Features International]], Ikiru Films, and [[Cha Cha Cha Films]] (although it later went uncredited) production,<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://upnblib.pedagogica.edu.co/bitstream/handle/20.500.12209/9294/TO-21633.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y|page=13|title=Cine del narcotr\u00e1fico mexicano y colombiano.
