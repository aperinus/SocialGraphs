It was produced by Kevin Frakes and Richard Lewis.\n\n==Plot==\nBy day, Richard Haig ([[Pierce Brosnan]]) is a successful and well-respected English professor in the UK. By night, Richard indulges his own romantic fantasies with a steady stream of beautiful undergraduates. So when Kate ([[Jessica Alba]]), Richard's stunning, athletic, 25-year-old American girlfriend tells him that she is pregnant, Richard is shocked. Putting his wandering eye behind him, he marries her and agrees to move to Los Angeles to start their family. It doesn't take long for Richard to realize that his past is hard to escape, as is the toll his strained relationship with his dysfunctional father has had on him. Meanwhile, Kate tells Richard that she has developed feelings for someone else. They separate and Richard is now free to move on with Kate's sister Olivia ([[Salma Hayek]]), with whom he has been in love with since before he married Kate. Olivia and Richard start dating soon after.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Richard\n**[[Oliver Bell]] as young Richard\n* [[Salma Hayek]] as Olivia\n* [[Jessica Alba]] as Kate\n* [[Ben McKenzie]] as Brian\n* [[Fred Melamed]] as Piggott\n* [[Ivan Sergei]] as Tim\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as Gordon\n* [[Lombardo Boyar]] as Ernesto\n* [[Merrin Dungey]] as Angela\n* Duncan Joiner as Jake\n* [[Lee Garlington]] as Wendy\n* [[Robert Mailhouse]] as Alan\n* [[Marlee Matlin]] as Cindy\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Jessica Alba]], [[Pierce Brosnan]] and [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] were the first to be cast in May.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Mike Jr.|title=Pierce Brosnan To Show ''How To Make Love Like An Englishman'' (Isn't He Irish?)|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/05/pierce-brosnan-to-show-how-to-make-love-like-an-englishman-isnt-he-irish/|accessdate=23 October 2013|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=8 May 2013}}</ref> Thomas later dropped out and was replaced by [[Salma Hayek]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Mike Jr.|title=Salma Hayek Lands Lead In ''How To Make Love Like An Englishman''|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/10/salma-hayek-lands-lead-in-how-to-make-love-like-an-englishman/|accessdate=23 October 2013|date=7 October 2013}}</ref> [[Ben McKenzie]] joined the cast on October 17.<ref name=McKenzie>{{cite news|last=Kroll|first=Justin|title=Ben McKenzie Joins Cast of ''How To Make Love Like an Englishman'' (Exclusive)|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/ben-mckenzie-how-to-make-love-like-an-englishman-1200734907/|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=17 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Filming==\nThe film was shot for 25 days, production started filming in [[Los Angeles]] on October 14, 2013 and ended on November 9, 2013.<ref name=\"McKenzie\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[American Film Market|AFM]] on November 6, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2014/10/mr-right-lakeshore-international-american-film-market-853341/|title='Mr Right' Rights Sell To Lakeshore & Sierra/Affinity \u2013 AFM Briefs - Deadline|author=The Deadline Team|website=Deadline Hollywood}}</ref> The film was released in [[Denmark]] on June 4, 2015.
