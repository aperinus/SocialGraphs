It stars [[Britney Spears]], [[Anson Mount]], [[Zoe Salda\u00f1a|Zoe Saldana]], [[Taryn Manning]], [[Kim Cattrall]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]]. Set in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], it centers on three teenage girls on a cross-country road trip, as they find themselves and their friendship in the process.\n\nDevelopment began in 2001 when Spears created a concept that was later expanded by Rhimes. Principal filming began in March 2001, and encompassed over six months. Produced by [[MTV Films]] and released on February 15, 2002, in North America by [[Paramount Pictures]], ''Crossroads'' was a box office success, grossing $61 million worldwide on a $12 million budget. It received generally unfavorable reviews, although Spears' acting was praised.\n\n==Plot==\nAs children growing up in a small [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] town, Lucy, Kit, and Mimi bury a \"wish box\" and vow to dig it up on the night of their high school graduation. However, as the trio grows up, their friendship fades: Lucy becomes the introverted valedictorian, Kit becomes the most popular girl in school, and Mimi becomes an outcast from the trailer park facing [[teenage pregnancy]].\n\nOn the night of graduation, they reunite to dig up the \"wish box\", remembering their old wishes: Kit wanted to get married, Lucy wanted to find her mother who abandoned her, and Mimi wanted to travel to [[California]]. Lucy and Kit try to convince Mimi, who is five months pregnant, not to go to [[Los Angeles]] to audition for a record company. However, they decide to go with her to Los Angeles the next morning. Kit is going to see her fianc\u00e9 who is a student at [[UCLA]], and Lucy is going to find her mother in [[Tucson, Arizona]].\n\nUnbeknownst to her overbearing father Pete, Lucy, Kit, and Mimi depart in a yellow 1973 [[Buick Skylark]] convertible with Ben. During the trip, the car breaks down in [[Louisiana]] and, with little money, Mimi suggests that they sing karaoke at a [[New Orleans]] bar for tips. At the bar, Mimi develops stage fright and is unable to sing. Lucy takes her place and is a hit, and the girls earn enough money to fix the car and continue on their way.\n\nWhile staying at a motel in [[Alabama]], Kit tells Lucy and Mimi that she heard a rumor about Ben going to jail for killing a guy. Uneasy for most of the trip, the girls finally confront Ben about the rumor, who reveals that he actually went to jail for driving his stepsister across state lines without parental consent because his stepfather was abusing her. Lucy and Ben fall in love with each other, and the girls have their first honest conversation since they were children: Lucy reveals that her mother left her and her father when she was three years old, but believes that her mother wants to see her again; Kit, who was overweight as a child, reveals that her mother sent her to \"fat camp\" every summer until she reached her goal weight, but now hates that Kit is prettier than her; Mimi reveals that her baby's father is not her ex-boyfriend Kurt, but a man who [[raped]] her at a party, and that she is planning to put her baby up for adoption.\n\nIn Tucson, Lucy finds her mother Caroline, who has remarried with two young sons and is unhappy to see her. Caroline reveals that Lucy was an [[unintended pregnancy]] and that she wants nothing to do with her, leaving Lucy heartbroken. At the motel, Ben consoles Lucy and impresses her by writing music to a poem she has written during the trip. Lucy then rejoins Kit, Mimi, and Ben, and they reach Los Angeles.\n\nOne night, Kit takes Mimi with her to surprise her fianc\u00e9 Dylan. Alone together in the motel, Lucy loses her [[virginity]] to Ben. Kit and Mimi arrive at Dylan's apartment to find him cheating on Kit with another woman. She then realizes that it was Dylan who raped Mimi, and punches him in the face. While running away, Mimi falls down the stairs and loses her baby. In the hospital, Lucy and Kit console her as she comes to terms with her loss, having decided to keep her baby once they reached Los Angeles.\n\nLucy calls her father to come take her, Kit, and Mimi back home, and Kit and Mimi tell her that she should go to the audition in Mimi's place. Lucy declines and prepares to leave with them and her father, but realizes that everything she has done has been to please her father instead of herself. Lucy tells her father to let her go, runs to Ben, and they kiss. She, Kit, and Mimi head to the audition with Ben and receive a standing ovation for their performance of her song, \"[[I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman]]\".\n\nThe girls re-bury the \"wish box\" at a Los Angeles beach, deciding not to make any wishes for the future, but to focus on the present and their friendship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Britney Spears]] as Lucy Wagner\n** [[Jamie Lynn Spears]] as young Lucy \n* [[Anson Mount]] as Ben\n* [[Zoe Salda\u00f1a|Zoe Saldana]] as Kit\n* [[Taryn Manning]] as Mimi\n* [[Kim Cattrall]] as Caroline\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Pete Wagner\n* [[Justin Long]] as Henry<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/259376/Crossroads/cast|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105064520/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/259376/Crossroads/cast|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2013|department=Movies & TV Dept.|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2013|title=Crossroads, Cast, Crew, Director and Awards|access-date=June 22, 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Beverly Johnson]] as Kit's mother\n* [[Kool Moe Dee]] as a bar owner\n* [[Dave Allen (actor)|David 'Gruber' Allen]] as a bar patron\n* [[Jesse Camp]] as an audition applicant\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn early 2001, Spears said that she had plans to make her film debut.<ref name=\"interview\" /> She and her team then created a concept for it,<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dealmemo.com/Interview/Britney%20Spears,%20Crossroads.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021125103848/http://www.dealmemo.com/Interview/Britney%20Spears%2C%20Crossroads.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 25, 2002 |title=Britney Spears, Crossroads Interview |first=Paul |last=Fischer |work=Deal Memo |publisher=NV and Powerstorm, Inc |access-date=July 15, 2011 }}</ref> which was later developed by ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' creator [[Shonda Rhimes]].<ref name=\"rhimes\" /> Spears commented that she \"talked to [Rhimes] and told her what I wanted the movie to be about and she elaborated on it.
