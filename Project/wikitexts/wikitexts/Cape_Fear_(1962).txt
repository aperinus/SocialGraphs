It was adapted by [[James R. Webb (writer)|James R. Webb]] from the 1957 novel ''[[The Executioners (MacDonald novel)|The Executioners]]'' by [[John D. MacDonald]]. The picture was directed by [[J. Lee Thompson]] from [[storyboards]] devised by original director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and released on April 12, 1962. The film concerns an attorney whose family is stalked by a criminal he helped to send to jail. The supporting cast features [[Martin Balsam]], [[Telly Savalas]] and [[Barrie Chase]].\n\n''Cape Fear'' was [[Cape Fear (1991 film)|remade in 1991]] by [[Martin Scorsese]]. Peck, Mitchum, and Balsam all appeared as different characters in the remake.<ref name=Book1>Kirsten Thompson, ''Cape Fear'' and Trembling: Familial Dread; In ''Literature and Film: A Guide to the Theory and Practice of Film Adaptation'', Edited by Robert Stam, Alessandra Raengo, Blackwell Publishing, 2005, ISBN 0631230556 (pp.126-147)</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Southeast Georgia]], [[Max Cady]] is released from prison after serving an eight-year sentence for [[rape]]. He promptly tracks down Sam Bowden, a lawyer whom he holds personally responsible for his conviction because Sam interrupted his attack and testified against him. Cady begins to stalk and subtly threaten Bowden's family. He kills the Bowden family dog, though Sam cannot prove Cady did it. A friend of Bowden, Police Chief Mark Dutton, attempts to intervene on Bowden's behalf, but he cannot prove Cady guilty of any crime.\n\nBowden hires [[private detective]] Charlie Sievers. Cady brutally rapes a young woman, Diane Taylor, when he brings her home, but neither the private eye nor Bowden can persuade her to testify. Bowden hires three men to beat up Cady and coerce him to leave town, but the plan backfires when Cady gets the better of all three. Cady's lawyer vows to have Bowden [[disbarred]].\n\nAfraid for his wife Peggy and 14-year-old daughter Nancy, Bowden takes them to their houseboat in the [[Cape Fear (region)|Cape Fear region]] of [[North Carolina]]. In an attempt to trick Cady, Bowden makes it seem as though he has gone to [[Atlanta]]. He fully expects Cady to follow his wife and daughter, and he plans on killing Cady to end the battle. On a dark night, Bowden and local deputy Kersek hide in the swamp nearby, but Cady realizes that Kersek is there and drowns him, leaving no evidence of a struggle. Eluding Bowden and setting the houseboat adrift down current, Cady first attacks Mrs. Bowden on the boat, causing Bowden to go to her rescue. Meanwhile, Cady swims back to shore to attack Nancy. Bowden realizes what has happened, and also swims ashore.\n\nThe two men engage in a final fight on the riverbank. Bowden manages to reach his gun, which he had dropped, and shoots Cady, wounding and disabling him. Cady tells Bowden, \"Finish the job\", but Bowden decides to do the thing that Cady earlier told him would be unbearable{{snd}}put him in prison for the rest of his life, to \"count the years, the months, the hours\". In the morning light, the Bowden family are together on a boat, traveling with police back to port.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits --->\n* [[Gregory Peck]] as Sam Bowden\n* [[Robert Mitchum]] as [[Max Cady]]\n* [[Polly Bergen]] as Peggy Bowden\n* [[Lori Martin]] as Nancy Bowden\n* [[Martin Balsam]] as Mark Dutton\n* [[Jack Kruschen]] as Dave Grafton\n* [[Telly Savalas]] as Charlie Sievers\n* [[Barrie Chase]] as Diane Taylor\n\nIn addition, [[Edward Platt]], the future \"[[Get Smart#The Chief|Chief]]\" on the television series ''[[Get Smart]]'', and November 1958 [[Playboy Playmate|''Playboy'' Playmate]] centerfold [[Joan Staley]] make brief appearances as a judge and a waitress, respectively.\n\n==Development==\n[[Cornel Wilde]] acquired the rights to John D.

New York Times 31 Dec 1960: 10.</ref>\n\n==Filming==\nPrincipal photography of ''Cape Fear'' began on April 6 and ended in June 1961. Thompson envisioned the film in black and white, believing that shooting the film in color would lessen the atmosphere. As an [[Alfred Hitchcock]] fan, he wanted to have [[Hitchcockian]] elements in the film, such as unusual lighting angles, an eerie musical score, closeups, and subtle hints rather than graphic depictions of the violence Cady has in mind for the family. Hitchcock collaborators [[Robert F. Boyle]] and [[George Tomasini]] served as production designer and editor.\n \nThe outdoor scenes were filmed on location in [[Savannah, Georgia]]; [[Stockton, California]]; and the Universal Studios backlot at [[Universal City, California]]. The indoor scenes were done at Universal Studios Soundstage. Mitchum had a real-life aversion to Savannah, where as a teenager, he had been charged with vagrancy and put on a [[chain gang]]. This resulted in a number of the outdoor scenes being shot at Ladd's Marina in Stockton, including the culminating conflict on the houseboat at the end of the movie.\n\nThe scene in which Mitchum attacks Polly Bergen's character on the houseboat was almost completely improvised.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Before the scene was filmed, Thompson suddenly told a crew member: \"Bring me a dish of eggs!\" Mitchum's rubbing the eggs on Bergen was not scripted and Bergen's reactions were real. She also suffered back injuries from being knocked around so much. She felt the impact of the \"attack\" for days.<ref>{{cite book|title=Robert Mitchum The Reluctant Star (DVD)|year=2009|publisher=Janson Media|location=Harrington Park}}</ref>  While filming the scene, Mitchum cut open his hand, leading Bergen to recall: \"his hand was covered in blood, my back was covered in blood.

MacDonald]], Cady was a soldier [[court-martial]]ed and convicted on then Lieutenant Bowden's testimony for the brutal rape of a 14-year-old girl. The censors stepped in, banned the use of the word \"rape\", and stated that depicting Cady as a soldier reflected adversely on U.S. military personnel.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n===Music===\n[[Bernard Herrmann]], as often in his scores, uses a reduced version of the symphony orchestra. Here, other than a 46-piece string section (slightly larger than usual for film scores), he adds four [[flutes]] (doubling on two [[piccolos]], two [[alto flute]]s in G, and two [[bass flute]]s in C) and eight [[French horn]]s. No use is made of further wind instruments or percussion.<ref>[http://www.filmscorerundowns.net/herrmann/cape_fear.pdf Bill Wrobel: Cape Fear, score rundown analysis]</ref>\n\nIn his 2002 book ''A Heart at Fire's Center: The Life and Music of Bernard Herrmann'', Stephen C. Smith writes:\n<blockquote>\n \"Yet Herrmann was perfect for ''Cape Fear'' ... Herrmann's score reinforces ''Cape Fear's'' savagery. Mainly a synthesis of past devices, its power comes from their imaginative application and another ingenious orchestration ... a rehearsal for his similar orchestration on Hitchcock's ''[[Torn Curtain]]'' in 1966. Like similar 'psychological' Herrmann scores, dissonant string combinations suggest the workings of a killer's mind (most startlingly in a queasy device for [[cello]] and [[bass viol]]s as Cadey prepares to attack the prostitute). Hermann's prelude searingly establishes the dramatic conflict: descending and ascending chromatic voices move slowly towards each other from their opposite registers, finally crossing\u2013just as Boden and Cadey's{{sic}} game of cat-and-mouse will end in deadly confrontation.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-1mUcGRpt0EC&pg=PA252 |title=A Heart at Fire's Center: The Life and Music of Bernard Herrmann - Steven C.
