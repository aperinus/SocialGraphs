IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO ADD EXTENDED DETAILS! -->\nMary Beth, a museum [[tour guide]], takes a group of school detention students on a secret museum tour, telling them, with wooden figures, the story of a [[Mexico|Mexican]] town called San Angel from the ''Book of Life'', holding every story in the world.\n\nOn the [[Day of the Dead]], [[Santa Muerte|La Muerte]], ruler of the Land of the Remembered, and [[Cizin|Xibalba]], ruler of the Land of the Forgotten, see young Manolo S\u00e1nchez and Joaqu\u00edn Mondragon competing for the love of young Mar\u00eda Posada. They strike a wager: if Mar\u00eda marries Manolo, Xibalba will no longer interfere in mortal affairs, but if she marries Joaqu\u00edn, La Muerte and Xibalba will swap realms. However, Xibalba cheats by giving Joaqu\u00edn his Medal of Everlasting Life, which grants the wearer invincibility.\n\nThe story begins with scenes of young Maria, Manolo, and Joaquin playing together as childhood friends. Mar\u00eda is sent to Spain to become a \"lady\" after freeing animals destined for slaughter. Years later, the day Mar\u00eda returns to San Angel, Joaqu\u00edn has become a military hero with the Medal's aid, but Manolo's musical aspirations are suppressed by his father Carlos, who trains him to be a [[Torero|bullfighter]] in their family tradition.\n\nAt Manolo's first bullfight he defeats the bull but refuses to kill it, angering Carlos and the crowd but impressing Mar\u00eda. That night, Mar\u00eda is pressured by her father and San Angel's mayor, General Ramiro Posada, to marry Joaqu\u00edn for his protection from the Bandit King Chakal. Mar\u00eda and Manolo profess their mutual love before dawn but are interrupted when Xibalba sends his dual-headed [[snake]] staff, which bites her and sends her into a [[coma]]. When Manolo brought Maria's body to the town, Joaqu\u00edn and Ramiro angrily blamed him for her \"death\", Manolo even blamed himself for Maria. Devastated by Mar\u00eda's apparent death, Manolo allows Xibalba to kill him, believing he will be reunited with Mar\u00eda in death.\n\nIn the Land of the Remembered, Manolo reunites with his mother and his ancestral family. They travel to La Muerte's castle, discovering Xibalba, now the ruler of the realm, who explains the bet and smugly reveals that Mar\u00eda didn't die because she was only bitten once and therefore survived. However, Manolo was bitten twice and died. Furious but determined to return to Mar\u00eda, Manolo travels to the Cave of Souls to reach La Muerte.\n\nInside, he meets the Candle Maker, the overseer of mortal lives and keeper of the Book of Life. The Candle Maker sees that Manolo's story in the Book of Life is blank and can be rewritten by himself, so he takes them to the Land of the Forgotten. They find La Muerte at Xibalba's castle and expose his cheating. Furious, La Muerte lectures Xibalba before offering a new wager at Manolo's request: Manolo's life will be returned if he completes a challenge of Xibalba's choosing, but if he fails, he will be forgotten and Xibalba will keep both realms. Xibalba sets Manolo against a giant bull skeleton made from the skeletons of every bull slain by the Sanchez family, believing that to be his greatest fear.\n\nMeanwhile, Mar\u00eda has been awakened from her coma, learns of Manolo's death, and reluctantly accepts Joaqu\u00edn's proposal. Their wedding is interrupted by Chakal, who leads his army to San Angel to find the Medal, which had once been in his possession. Chakal kills Carlos, who arrives in the Land of the Remembered in time to see Manolo's fight. Manolo, realizing his fear is actually of ''being himself'', refuses to fight and instead sings an apology to the bull, appeasing it and touching the hearts of everyone present (including Xibalba and Carlos).\n\nImpressed, the deities resurrect Manolo and send him and his family to San Angel to protect the town. Manolo is knocked unconscious when Chakal [[Suicide|destructs himself]], but he is protected by the Medal, which Joaqu\u00edn had slipped him earlier. Joaqu\u00edn returns it to Xibalba and resolves to be a true hero, while Manolo and Mar\u00eda are happily married as Xibalba and La Muerte reconcile.\n\nIn the present, Mary Beth finishes the story, and the amazed children leave the museum. Mary Beth and a security guard reveal themselves to be La Muerte and Xibalba in disguise. The Candle Maker appears and encourages the audience to write their own story.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{multiple image\n | direction         = horizontal\n | total_width       = 350\n | image1            = Channing Tatum SDCC 2014.jpg\n | width1            = 1803\n | height1           = 2606\n | image2            = Christina Applegate SDCC 2014.jpg\n | width2            = 1924\n | height2           = 2711\n | image3            = Ron Perlman SDCC 2014.jpg\n | width3            = 1837\n | height3           = 2316\n | footer            = Channing Tatum, Christina Applegate and Ron Perlman at ''The Book of Life'' panel at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]\n}}\n* [[Diego Luna]] as Manolo S\u00e1nchez,<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> a [[torero]] with a guitar and two swords, and the youngest in a family of skilled bullfighters.\n** Emil-Bastien Bouffard as a young Manolo.\n** Joe Matthews as young Manolo's singing voice.\n* [[Zoe Salda\u00f1a|Zoe Saldana]] as Mar\u00eda Posada, Manolo and Joaqu\u00edn's best friend and love interest.
