It was adapted by [[Cliff Green]] from the 1967 [[Picnic at Hanging Rock (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Joan Lindsay]].\n\nThe plot involves the disappearance of several schoolgirls and their teacher during a picnic at [[Hanging Rock, Victoria|Hanging Rock]], Victoria on Valentine's Day in 1900, and the subsequent effect on the local community. ''Picnic at Hanging Rock'' was a commercial and critical success, and helped draw international attention to the then-emerging [[Australian New Wave]] of cinema.\n\n==Plot==\nAt Appleyard College, a girls' [[private school]] near the town of [[Woodend, Victoria|Woodend]] in [[Victoria, Australia]], students are getting ready on the morning of [[Valentine's Day]], 1900. One student, an orphan named Sara, has a deep connection with her elder roommate Miranda. The school's austere headmistress, Mrs Appleyard, has arranged a picnic to a local geological formation known as [[Hanging Rock, Victoria|Hanging Rock]], accompanied by the peculiar mathematics teacher Miss Greta McCraw and the young French teacher Mademoiselle de Poitiers. Mrs Appleyard keeps Sara and jittery teacher Miss Lumley at the college.\n\nBuggy operator Ben Hussey gets the group to Hanging Rock by mid-afternoon, where they picnic at its base. Mr Hussey notes his pocket watch has stopped at the stroke of 12, as has Miss McCraw's. With permission from Mlle. de Poitiers, Miranda and classmates Marion, Irma, and Edith decide to explore Hanging Rock. The group is soon after observed crossing a creek by a young Englishman, Michael Fitzhubert, along with Albert, his friend and coachman for the Fitzhubert family.\n\nAfter exploring the rock for a while, Miranda, Marion, and Irma remove their shoes and stockings. Near the summit, seemingly under the influence of an unseen force, the four collapse and fall asleep next to a  monolith. Everyone at the picnic spot is apparently asleep as well, except for Miss McCraw who looks at a [[geometry]] textbook and up at the rock. The four awaken synchronously and, as if in a [[trance]], all except Edith move up into a crevice. Witnessing this, Edith suddenly screams and flees down the rock in terror.\n\nWhen the party returns to the college a few hours late and hysterical, Mrs Appleyard notes that Miss McCraw is absent. Mr. Hussey explains that they all woke up to Edith's screams and, along with the three students, Miss McCraw was nowhere to be found. Sara is especially devastated by the disappearance due to her connection with Miranda. A search party conducted by the local police finds no trace of them, although Edith reveals that she witnessed Miss McCraw climbing the rock in only undergarments, as well as an odd red cloud. Michael Fitzhubert is questioned and informs that he briefly saw the schoolgirls, but can provide no clues as to their whereabouts.\n\nMichael becomes obsessed with the mystery, deciding to conduct his own search of Hanging Rock along with Albert. After finding nothing, Michael decides to remain overnight and begins searching again the next day. He too eventually collapses, hearing bits of conversation from the picnic and having a vision of the girls going into the crevice, up to which he drags himself. Albert returns, finding Michael nearly [[catatonic]]. He gets help and Michael is carried down to a carriage. As he departs, Michael passes Albert a fragment of [[lace]] he had clenched in his hand. Albert again ascends Hanging Rock and discovers Irma unconscious but somehow alive.\n\nMrs Appleyard advises Miss Lumley that the mystery is devastating the school's reputation, bringing to her attention that several parents have withdrawn their children. Unrest spreads among locals about the mystery and school. At the Fitzhubert home, where Irma is treated for dehydration, a medical examination strangely shows only minor injuries. A servant girl notes that Irma's [[corset]] is missing. Irma tells the police and Mlle. de Poitiers that she has no memory of what happened.\n\nMrs Appleyard notifies Sara that her presence at the college is endangered, as her guardian has not been keeping up with payments or communication. Increasingly despondent due to this and her loss of Miranda, Sara reveals to a maid that she was in an orphanage with her brother before being able to come to the college through her guardian, describing how she was abused by the [[matron]]. She also tells Mlle. de Poitiers that Miranda knew she would vanish forever.\n\nDuring an exercise class, Irma arrives to bid farewell to her classmates, who violently swarm her, demanding that she reveal what happened on the rock and where the missing girls are. As everyone exits crying, Mlle. de Poitiers finds Sara feeble and strapped to a posture correction board. Afterward, Miss Lumley gives notice to a drunken Mrs Appleyard that she is resigning. Mrs Appleyard goes to Sara's room that night and informs her that, as her guardian has still not paid her tuition, she will be returned to the orphanage, then weeps in her office while Sara leaves her room.\n\nThe next day, Albert reveals to Michael that he had a dream in which his lost sister, revealed to be Sara, visited him. Meanwhile, Mrs Appleyard claims that Sara's guardian came to pick her up early that morning. The students then depart for their holiday, and at dinner with Mlle. de Poitiers, an unhinged Mrs Appleyard spitefully rages about Miss McCraw and Hanging Rock. In the morning, Sara's body is found by the school gardener in a small [[greenhouse]], apparently having plummeted into it from the school's rooftop. He goes into Mrs Appleyard's office to inform her but is rendered nearly speechless as she is in full [[mourning dress]] with her possessions packed, unresponsively staring.\n\nDuring a flashback to the picnic, a police sergeant states in a voiceover that Mrs Appleyard's body was later found at the base of Hanging Rock, apparently having fallen, and that the search for Miranda, Marion, and Miss McCraw continued for several years without success, their disappearance remaining a mystery.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Rachel Roberts (actress)|Rachel Roberts]] as Mrs Appleyard\n* [[Dominic Guard]] as Michael Fitzhubert\n* [[Helen Morse]] as Mlle. de Poitiers\n* [[Jacki Weaver]] as Minnie\n* [[Anne-Louise Lambert]] as Miranda St. Clare\n* [[Margaret Nelson]] as Sara Waybourne\n* [[John Jarratt]] as Albert Crundall \n* [[Wynn Roberts (actor)|Wyn Roberts]] as Sgt Bumpher\n* [[Karen Robson]] as Irma Leopold\n* Christine Schuler as Edith Horton\n* Jane Vallis as Marion Quade\n* [[Vivean Gray]] as Miss McCraw\n* [[Martin Vaughan]] as Ben Hussey\n* [[Kirsty Child]] as Miss Lumley\n* Frank Gunnell as Mr Whitehead \n* [[Tony Llewellyn-Jones]] as Tom\n* [[John Fegan (actor)|John Fegan]] as Doc.
