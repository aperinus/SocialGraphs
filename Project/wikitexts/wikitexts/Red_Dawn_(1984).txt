The film depicts a fictional [[World War III]] centering on a land invasion of the [[continental United States]] by an alliance of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]], [[Warsaw Pact]] and [[Latin America|Latin American]] states. The story follows a group of teenaged guerillas, known as the Wolverines, in Soviet-occupied [[Colorado]]. The film stars [[Patrick Swayze]], [[Charlie Sheen]], [[C. Thomas Howell]], [[Lea Thompson]] and [[Jennifer Grey]], with supporting roles played by [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]], [[Ron O'Neal]], [[William Smith (actor)|William Smith]] and [[Powers Boothe]]. \n\nDespite mixed reviews from critics, the film became a commercial success, grossing $38 million against a budget of $17 million. It was the first film to be released in the U.S. with a [[PG-13 (Motion Picture Association)|PG-13]] rating<ref name=\"Parker\">{{cite web |last1=Parker |first1=Ryan |date=May 23, 2017 |title=How 'The Temple of Doom' Changed the MPAA Ratings System |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/indiana-jones-temple-doom-changed-mpaa-ratings-system-999618/ |website=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> (under the [[Motion Picture Association film rating system#Addition of the PG-13 rating|modified rating system]] introduced on July 1, 1984). A [[Red Dawn (2012 film)|remake]] was released in 2012.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn an alternate 1980s, the United States of America is strategically isolated after [[NATO]] is disbanded. At the same time, the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies aggressively expand. In addition, the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian]] wheat harvest fails while a socialist ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' occurs in [[Mexico]].\n\nIn September, in the town of [[Calumet, Colorado]], a local high school teacher pauses upon seeing Soviet troops parachuting from [[Antonov An-12|An-12 transport aircraft]]. He walks outside to question them and they open fire, killing the teacher and several students. Pandemonium follows as students flee amid heavy gunfire. Jed Eckert, who had dropped his brother Matt off at the high school, returns to pick up him and several of their friends, narrowly escaping the chaos.\n\nIn downtown Calumet, [[Cuban Army|Cuban]], [[Nicaraguan Armed Forces|Nicaraguan]], and [[Soviet Army|Soviet troops]] begin imposing order after a hasty occupation. Cuban Colonel Ernesto Bella instructs the [[KGB]] to go to the local sporting goods stores and obtain the records of the store's gun sales, the ATF [[Form 4473]], to determine who owns firearms in Calumet and in the surrounding rural area.\n\nBrothers Jed and Matt Eckert, along with their friends Robert Morris, Danny, Daryl Bates, and Arturo \"Aardvark\" Mondragon, flee into the wilderness after hastily equipping themselves at a gas station general store owned by Robert's father. At one point they encounter a Soviet roadblock, but are saved by a U.S. Army [[UH-1]] helicopter gunship. After several weeks in the forest, they learn that Jed and Matt's father is being held in a \"re-education camp\" at the town's [[drive-in]] movie theater. They visit the camp, speaking to Mr. Eckert through the fence, and learn that their mother is dead; Mr. Eckert reminds them he had purposely raised them in a strenuous manner, ordering them to avenge him.\n\nThe kids visit the Masons, behind enemy lines in \"occupied America\" where they learn Robert's father was executed for \"aiding guerillas\" (providing guns to the boys from his store). The Masons ask Jed and Matt to take care of their granddaughters, Toni and Erica. After killing Soviet soldiers in the woods, the youths begin attacking the occupation forces, calling themselves \"Wolverines\" after the school mascot. The Soviets respond with reprisals, executing groups of civilians following every Wolverine attack. The fathers of Jed, Matt, and Aardvark are killed in one of these executions. Daryl's father, Mayor Bates, tries to save the lives of the captured citizens by collaborating, but with little success. The reprisal tactics do not deter the Wolverines.\n\nThe Wolverines meet American [[F-15 Eagle|F-15]] fighter pilot Lt. Col. Andrew Tanner, shot down by Cuban [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21s]]. He informs them of the current state of the war: several American cities, including [[Washington D.C.]], were destroyed by nuclear strikes, [[Strategic Air Command]] was crippled by Cuban saboteurs, and paratroopers were dropped from airliners to seize key positions in preparation for the main assaults via Mexico and [[Alaska]]. Most of the southern United States and Northwestern Canada are occupied by the Soviets, but American counterattacks have halted Soviet advances along the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] and the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], and the lines have now stabilized. \n\nTanner assists the Wolverines in organizing raids. This draws the attention of Soviet General Bratchenko, who orders further reprisals against the civilian population. The Wolverines' actions, and the reprisals lead to the high command on both sides of the war to know the name \"Wolverines\", and the Soviet generals publicly state that the area \"may not be pacified for much longer\". Soon after, visiting the front line, Tanner and Aardvark are killed in the crossfire of a tank battle. Daryl is caught by the Soviets after being turned in by his father. After torturing him, KGB officers force Daryl to swallow a [[tracking device]], and release him to rejoin the guerrillas. A ''[[Spetsnaz]]'' unit is sent into the mountains carrying portable [[radio triangulation]] equipment, but are ambushed by the Wolverines. The group traces the source of the signal to Daryl, who confesses, pleading for mercy. He is executed by a hardened Robert after Jed executes a Spetsnaz operative as the others cannot kill their friend.\n\nThe remaining Wolverines are ambushed by [[Mi-24]] helicopter gunships, and Toni and Robert are killed. Jed and Matt attack the Soviet headquarters in Calumet to distract the troops while Danny and Erica escape. The plan works, but both Jed and Matt are mortally wounded. Colonel Bella finds the brothers, but feeling the already too-great loss of the war, the colonel is unable to kill them, so he motions them on. The brothers reach a bench in the park, holding each other as they die. Meanwhile, Danny and Erica trek through the Rocky Mountain Wilderness, reaching the frontier of Free America.\n\nIn the closing scene, a plaque is seen with Partisan Rock in the background. It is fenced off and an American flag flies nearby implying that the United States won the war. The plaque reads:<blockquote>... In the early days of World War III, guerrillas \u2013 mostly children \u2013 placed the names of their lost upon this rock. They fought here alone and gave up their lives, so \"that this nation shall not perish from the earth.\"</blockquote>\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Patrick Swayze]] as Jed Eckert\n* [[C.

It was set in the near future as a combined force of Russians and Cubans launched an invasion of the Southwestern U.S.. Ten children take to the hills when their small town is captured, turning into a skilled and lethal guerrilla band.<ref>Bart p 109\u2013110</ref>\n\nProducer Barry Beckerman read the script, and, in the words of [[Peter Bart]], \"thought it had the potential to become a tough, taut, 'art' picture made on a modest budget that could possibly break out to find a wider audience.\"<ref name=\"Bart p 110\">Bart p 110</ref> His father Sidney Beckerman helped him pay a $5,000 option. Reynolds wanted to direct but the Beckermans wanted someone more established. [[Walter Hill]] briefly considered the script before turning it down, as did several other directors.{{Who|date=September 2021}}<ref name=\"Bart p 110\"/>\n\nThe Beckermans pitched the project to [[David Begelman]] at MGM, but were turned down. They tried again at that studio when it was run by [[Frank Yablans]]. Senior vice-president for production [[Peter Bart]], who remembers it as a \"sharply written anti-war movie ... a sort of ''[[Lord of the Flies]]''\",<ref name=\"bart\">{{cite news|title=First Look: Famous Firings a Tough Ax to Follow|last=Bart|first= Peter|newspaper=Variety|date=September 28, 2009|page=2}}</ref> took the project to Yablans.\n\nThe script's chances increased when Reynolds became mentored by [[Steven Spielberg]], who helped him make ''[[Fandango (1985 film)|Fandango]]''.<ref name=\"Bart p 110\"/> MGM bought the script.\nThe film depicts a group of high school students who engage in [[guerrilla warfare]] against troops of Cuba, Nicaragua and the Soviet Union who have [[Mainland invasion of the United States|invaded the United States]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Schoolkids Battle Red Army in ''Red Dawn'' |author=Richard E. Sincere Jr. |publisher=The American Civil Defense Association |journal=Journal of Civil Defense |date=October 1984 |page=17}}</ref> \n\n=== John Milius ===\nBart recalls that things changed when \"the chieftains at MGM got a better idea. Instead of making a poignant little antiwar movie, why not make a teen ''[[Rambo_(franchise)|Rambo]]'' and turn the project over to John Milius, a genial filmmaker who loved war movies. The idea was especially popular with a member of the MGM board of directors, [[Alexander Haig|General Alexander Haig]], the former Nixon chief of staff, who yearned to supervise the film personally and develop a movie career.\"<ref name=\"bart\"/>\n\nBart says most of MGM's executives, except for Yablans, were opposed to Milius directing. Bart claims he made a last minute attempt to get Reynolds to direct the film and went to see Spielberg. However, by this stage ''Fandango'' was in rough cut, and Bart sensed that Spielberg was disappointed in the film and would not speak up for Reynolds.<ref>Bart p. 111</ref> Milius was signed to direct at a fee of $1.25 million, plus a gun of his choice.<ref>Bart p. 112</ref>\n\nMilius set about rewriting the script. He and Haig devised a backstory in which the circumstances of the invasion would occur; this was reportedly based on [[New Order (Nazism)#Hitler's plans for North America|Hitler's proposed plans to invade the U.S.]] during World War II.<ref>Bart pp. 112f</ref> Haig took Milius under his wing, bringing him to the [[Hudson Institute]], the conservative think tank founded by [[Herman Kahn]], to develop a plausible scenario. Milius saw the story as a [[Third World]] liberation struggle in reverse; Haig introduced [[Nicaragua]] and suggested that, with the collapse of NATO, a left-wing Mexican government would participate in the Soviet invasion, effectively splitting the U.S. in half.<ref>{{cite news | last=Hoberman | first=J. | title=The North Koreans Are Coming! | newspaper=Film Comment | edition=48.6 | date=November 2012 | pages=52\u201354, 56}}</ref> Bart says, \"Even Milius was taken aback by Haig's approach to the project. 'This is going to end up as a jingoistic, flag-waving movie,' Milius fretted. As a result, the budget of this once $6&nbsp;million movie almost tripled.\"<ref name=\"bart\"/>\n\nOther changes included a shift in focus from conflict within the group to conflict between the teens and their oppressors, and the acceleration of the ages of some of the characters from early teens to high school age and beyond.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shaw |first=Tony |date=2007 |title=Hollywood's Cold War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QzIkDQAAQBAJ |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=270 |isbn=9780748630738 |access-date=October 17, 2016 |archive-date=February 26, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226030243/https://books.google.com/books?id=QzIkDQAAQBAJ |url-status=live }}</ref> There was also the addition of a sequence where some children visit a camp to find their parents have been brainwashed.<ref>Bart p. 113</ref>\n\nMilius later said, \"I see this as an anti-war movie in the sense that if both sides could see this, maybe it wouldn't have to happen. I think it would be good for Americans to see what a war would be like. The film isn't even that violent \u2013 the war shows none of the horrors that could happen in World War III. In fact, everything that happened in the movie happened in World War II.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nBart says Yablans pushed through filming faster than Milius wanted because MGM needed a movie over the summer. Milius wanted more time to plan, including devising futuristic weaponry and to not shoot over winter, but had to accede.<ref>Bart p. 114</ref>\n\nThe Pentagon withdrew its cooperation from the film.<ref>Bart p. 133</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nMilius wanted [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] to play the US pilot but Frank Yablans overruled him. Powers Boothe was selected instead.<ref>Bart p 135</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe movie was filmed in and around the city of [[Las Vegas, New Mexico]]. Many of the buildings and structures which appear in the film, including a historic [[Fred Harvey Company]] hotel adjacent to the train depot, the train yard, and a building near downtown, which was repainted with the name of \"Calumet, Colorado\", referencing the town in [[Michigan]], are still there today.{{when|date=August 2020}} An old [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] grocery store was converted to a sound stage and used for several scenes in the movie.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fast-rewind.com/locations_reddawn.htm |title=Red Dawn Movie Filming Locations |work=The 80s Movies Rewind |publisher=Fast-rewind.com |access-date=August 27, 2011 |archive-date=August 5, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805215920/http://www.fast-rewind.com/locations_reddawn.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nBefore starting work on the movie, the cast underwent an intensive eight-week military training course. During that time, production crews designed and built special combat vehicles in [[Newhall, California]]. ''[[Soldier of Fortune (magazine)|Soldier of Fortune]]'' reported that the movie's [[T-72]] tank was such a precise replica that \"while it was being carted around Los Angeles, two [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[intelligence officer]]s followed it to the studio and wanted to know where it had come from\".\n\nPowers Boothe later claimed that \"Milius cut out the emotional life of its characters. Originally, my character was anti-war, as well as a rightist. I was supposed to be the voice of reason in that movie. But certain cuts negated my character.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=ACTOR FINDS SUCCESS IN THE WILDS|last=Baltake|first=Joe|newspaper= Philadelphia Daily News|date=July 18, 1985|page= 51}}</ref>\n\nLea Thompson said the original cut featured a love scene between her and Powers Boothe but it \"was cut out after some previews because of the age difference.

Not simply in terms of its action set pieces but in its portrait of America as a place where the frontier mentality lives on just beneath the surface.}}<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-08-10 |title=Was Red Dawn the most right-wing blockbuster ever? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/red-dawn-movie-arnold-schwarzenegger-stranger-things-patrick-swayze-chris-hemsworth-remake-a9050186.html |access-date=2022-09-27 |website=The Independent |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Home media ===\n''Red Dawn'' has been variously released across a variety of formats.\n* In 1985, ''Red Dawn'' released on [[VHS]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Red dawn|date=March 9, 1985|oclc = 11765327}}</ref> It was also released at the same time on [[PAL]] and [[Betamax]].\n* Also in 1985, ''Red Dawn'' released on [[LaserDisc]] .<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/24363/ML100499/Red-Dawn|title=LaserDisc Database \u2013 Red Dawn [ML100499]|website=Lddb.com|access-date=March 9, 2019|archive-date=October 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181012175450/https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/24363/ML100499/Red-Dawn|url-status=live}}</ref> The film was released several times on this format, with the latest in April 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/05394/ML104578/Red-Dawn|title=LaserDisc Database \u2013 Red Dawn [ML104578]|website=Lddb.com|access-date=March 9, 2019|archive-date=October 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181013014335/https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/05394/ML104578/Red-Dawn|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* In 1998, ''Red Dawn'' released on [[DVD]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/red-dawn-dvd-1984/3311115.p?skuId=3311115|title = Red Dawn DVD|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181012214510/https://www.bestbuy.com/site/red-dawn-dvd-1984/3311115.p?skuId=3311115|archive-date = October 12, 2018}}</ref>\n* In 2007, a two-disc DVD Collector's Edition was released.
