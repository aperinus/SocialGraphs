Wong]], [[Joan Chen]], [[Gregg Sulkin]], and [[Tyler Posey]].\n\n''White Frog'' premiered at the [[San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival]] on March 8, 2012.<ref name=caam />\n\n==Plot==\nNick Young (Stewart) is a high school freshman with [[autism spectrum disorder]] who idolizes his perfect older brother Chaz Young (Shum). While riding his bike to a friend's house, Chaz is hit by a group of guys driving recklessly and dies. The crash leaves Nick fighting to overcome his grief while feeling misunderstood by his distraught parents (Wong and Chen), who are left trying to preserve the memory of their \"perfect son\".\n\nOne of Chaz's friends, Doug (Posey), takes Nick under his wing and has Nick take Chaz's place in a weekly poker game with their friends Ajit, Cameron and Randy (Sulkin). Randy baffles the group by being hostile to Nick's face while defending him when he's not around. Doug and Randy bring Nick to the LGBT community center that Chaz volunteered at, which confuses Nick. Just as Randy begins warming to him, Nick stumbles upon pictures of Chaz and Randy suggesting that they were more than just friends. Randy confirms that he and Chaz were gay, shattering Nick's worldview and driving him into despair.\n\nNick eventually confronts his parents, who refuse to accept Chaz's sexuality. Nick runs away from home, and his parents go to the shelter to look for him. While there, they learn that Chaz's voice might be heard on a video presentation to be played that night, and proceed to call a lawyer relative to try to halt the proceedings, leaving Doug to search for Nick. Randy gets his father to help him stop the Youngs' lawyer, coming out to him in the process. Nick, meanwhile, discovers a video message that Chaz had made as a way of coming out to Nick. Hearing the confession in Chaz's own words inspires him to return to the shelter and give a speech about acceptance, reconciling himself, his parents, and Randy with Chaz's memory.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Booboo Stewart]] as Nick Young, a teen with Asperger's\n* [[Harry Shum, Jr.]] as Chaz Young, the late older brother of Nick\n* [[Gregg Sulkin]] as Randy Goldman, Chaz's secret lover\n* [[B.
