Lucy is turning thirty and her love life is embarrassingly dull. Joe on the other hand is infatuated  with his attractive neighbor Jane ([[Elle Macpherson]]). Lucy then decides to form a death pact with Joe like they'd had back in college. If they do not both find true love by the time Lucy turns thirty, then they will both jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nJane comes to an artwork show of Joe's where Joe finally gathers up the courage to ask her out, while Lucy begins dating Bwick Elias ([[Ben Stiller]]), a weirdo artist who paints with his own body parts. Joe soon realizes that Jane isn't who he thought she ought to be. Bwick also turns out to be \"no Joe\" for Lucy. It is at this point that Joe and Lucy realize that they are perfect for each other.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Sarah Jessica Parker]] as Lucy Ackerman\n*[[Eric Schaeffer]] as Joe MacGonauhgill\n*[[Elle Macpherson]] as Jane Lindquist\n*[[Ben Stiller]] as Bwick Elias\n*[[James Rebhorn]] as Simon Ackerman\n*[[Robert John Burke]] as Handsome Man\n*[[David Thornton (actor)|David Thornton]] as Ted\n*[[Bill Sage]] as Dick\n*[[Dominic Chianese]] as Al\n*[[Scarlett Johansson]] as Emily\n\n==Reception==\n''If Lucy Fell'' earned mostly negative reviews from critics, holding an 18% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 28 reviews.<ref>{{Citation|title=If Lucy Fell (1996)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/if_lucy_fell|language=en|access-date=2021-07-07}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0116606}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|if_lucy_fell|If Lucy Fell}}\n* {{Mojo title|iflucyfell}}\n\n[[Category:1996 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:1996 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:TriStar Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Eric Schaeffer]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n\n\n{{1990s-romantic-comedy-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
