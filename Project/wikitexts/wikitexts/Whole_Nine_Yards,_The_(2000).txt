Its story follows a mild-mannered dentist as he travels to Chicago to inform a mob boss about the whereabouts of his new neighbor, a former hitman with a price on his head.\n\nThe film was produced by [[Morgan Creek Productions]], [[Franchise Pictures]], Rational Packaging, and Lansdown Films and was released on February 18, 2000. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $106 million. A sequel, ''[[The Whole Ten Yards]]'', was released in 2004.\n\n==Plot==\nNicholas \"Oz\" Oseransky is a likable Quebec dentist from Chicago, but is hated by his wife Sophie and mother-in-law. Oz's assistant Jill jokingly asks him to name a price to have Sophie disappear. Oz meets a new neighbor, and realizes he is Jimmy \"the Tulip\" Tudeski, an infamous Chicago contract killer with a bounty on his head.\n\nOz reveals Jimmy's identity to Sophie, who is intrigued. Oz befriends Jimmy, and shares his unhappiness: his business partner, Sophie's father, was involved with an underage boy and embezzled from the practice to pay off the boy's family before committing suicide, leaving Oz deeply in debt. Oz returns home, where Sophie has arranged for him to fly to Chicago and share Jimmy's whereabouts with mob boss Janni Gogolak for a reward. Oz is reluctant but complies.\n\nArriving in Chicago, Oz has no intention of giving Jimmy up. At his hotel, he meets Franklin \"Frankie Figs\" Figueroa, Janni's enforcer, and denies any knowledge of Jimmy, but is brought to Janni's estate. He meets Cynthia, Jimmy's estranged wife. Janni instructs Frankie to accompany Oz home and keep an eye on Jimmy until Janni and his men can take him out. At the hotel, Oz calls Jimmy to warn him, but is told Jimmy knows what Oz has done. Cynthia arrives and tells Oz that Janni and Jimmy both want each other and Cynthia dead to collect a $10 million trust \u2013 \"the whole nine yards.\" Oz and Cynthia drunkenly sleep together, and he vows to protect her.\n\nIn Canada, Frankie and Oz meet Jimmy, who reveals he and Frankie are planning to kill Janni and Cynthia. Jimmy explains Sophie tried to hire him to kill Oz, and he plans to lure Janni to Montreal. Jimmy offers to kill Sophie, which Oz declines. At work, Oz tells Jill everything. She reveals that she too is a contract killer, hired by Sophie to kill Oz, Jill liked him too much, however, and cancelled the hit. She demands to meet her hero, Jimmy, who enlists her help. Oz tries to call Cynthia, who is en route with Janni. When Janni's gang arrives at Oz's house, Cynthia warns Oz that Janni will kill him after killing Jimmy. The two watch as the gang walks into the ambush.\n\nDown the street, Sophie meets with another hitman, but when he recognizes Janni and Sophie explains the situation, he heads for the house with a gun, taking the car keys with him. Inside, Janni is distracted by a naked Jill; she, Jimmy and Frankie kill Janni and his men. Oz and Cynthia drive away as Jimmy also shoots Sophie\u2019s hitman, much to Sophie's horror, and discovers he is an undercover [[Surete du Quebec|S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec]] detective. As they dispose of the bodies, Oz calls and suggests a deal to benefit everyone. At his office, he alters the dead detective's teeth to match Jimmy's dental records, then sets his and Janni\u2019s bodies on fire in Oz's car. Investigators find the remains and believe Janni and Jimmy are dead, and, while heading to Jimmy\u2019s house with the intent to arrest him, discover a recorder in the detective\u2019s car; Sophie\u2019s conversation about killing Oz sends her and her mother to prison, despite Sophie's claim that Jill is the real killer. Oz is cleared of suspicion, and Cynthia collects the $10 million, transferring it to Jimmy in exchange for her and Oz's lives.\n\nWhile Cynthia and Jill, who have just met face-to-face, are at the bank, Jimmy and Frankie take Oz onto a yacht. Jill urges Cynthia to split the money with her and run, leaving Oz to be killed by Jimmy, but Cynthia realizes she loves Oz and refuses to betray him, and Jill assures her it was a test; Jimmy wants to give Cynthia and Oz $1 million as a wedding gift.\n\nOn the boat, Jimmy confirms that the money has been transferred. He points a gun at Oz, but shoots Frankie instead, explaining that Frankie, believing Jimmy had gone soft, would have killed them both. Oz attributes the softness to Jimmy falling in love. Jill arrives and jumps into Jimmy's arms and, before he and Jill leave, Jimmy tells Oz to say hello to his widow for him. Oz, ignorant of the $1 million, asks Cynthia to marry him and she accepts. Later, the happy couple dances above [[Niagara Falls]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as James Stefan \"Jimmy The Tulip\" Tudeski, a sardonic, morally inconsistent hitman.\n* [[Matthew Perry]] as Dr. Nicholas \"Oz\" Oseransky, a put upon but selfless dentist.\n* [[Rosanna Arquette]] as Sophie Oseransky, Oz's money-grabbing wife.\n* [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] as Franklin \"Frankie Figs\" Figueroa, a humorous but intimidating hitman.\n* [[Natasha Henstridge]] as Cynthia Tudeski, Jimmy's tough estranged wife.\n* [[Amanda Peet]] as Jill St. Claire, Oz's loyal, cheerful assistant.\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as Janni Pytor Gogol\u00e1k, a vengeful hitman and Jimmy's nemesis.\n* [[Harland Williams]] as Special Agent Steve Hanson\n* Howard Bilerman as Dave Martin\n* [[Stephanie Biddle]] as jazz singer\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn April 1999, it was announced Matthew Perry would star alongside Bruce Willis in the Franchise Pictures-produced film.<ref name=\"PerryWhole9\">{{cite news | url=https://variety.com/1999/film/news/perry-goes-whole-9-yards-with-willis-in-hitman-laffer-1117493253/ | title=Perry goes 'Whole 9 Yards' with Willis in hitman laffer | first=Michael | last=Fleming | date=April 14, 1999 | work=Variety | access-date=April 12, 2022}}</ref> Matthew Perry filmed the movie during the sixth season hiatus of ''[[Friends]]''.<ref name=\"PerryWhole9\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''The Whole Nine Yards'' grossed $57.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $49.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $106.4 million.<ref name=\"bom\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=wholenineyards.htm |title=The Whole Nine Yards (2000) |access-date=2008-05-16 |work=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref>\n\nThe film grossed $13.4 million in its opening weekend, finishing second at the box office.
