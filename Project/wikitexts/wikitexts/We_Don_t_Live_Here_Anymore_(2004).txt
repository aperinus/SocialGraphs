[[Warner Independent Pictures]] gave the film a limited release in theaters on August 13, 2004.\n\n==Plot==\nJack and Hank are two friends who teach literature at the local university. They regularly meet for dinner as a quartet with their respective wives, Terry (married to Jack) and Edith (married to Hank). Edith and Jack embark on an affair, which Terry starts to become suspicious about but doesn\u2019t outright confront her husband either. Instead, she gets closer to Hank, who is himself a womanizer. When Jack learns his wife has slept with Hank, he does not erupt in anger as Terry expected, and his indifferent reaction upsets Terry. The two couples must contend with the entanglements of their deceits and betrayals.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Mark Ruffalo]] as Jack Linden\n*[[Laura Dern]] as Terry Linden\n*[[Peter Krause]] as Hank Evans\n*[[Naomi Watts]] as Edith Evans\n* Sam Charles as Sean Linden\n* Ginger Page as Natasha Linden\n* Jennifer Bishop as Sharon Evans\n* Amber Rothwell as Lauren\n\n==Production==\nNaomi Watts, who had been longtime friends with director John Curran, had the choice of lead roles. She declined to play Terry because she had just finished filming \u201cthe emotionally draining\u201d ''[[21 Grams]]''.<ref name=\"Dern\" /> Laura Dern had initial reservations about playing Terry, saying \u201cI was halfway through the script, I thought, \u2018OK, I\u2019ve read this before. This is a great part, but the guy has this ogre wife and he\u2019s about to get into this affair. They\u2019re obviously going to run off together and I\u2019ll be this boorish character who ends up alone.\u2019\u201d<ref name=\"Dern\" /> However, Curran convinced Dern that the character and her relationship with Jack would be more complex.\n\nThe film was shot in 30 days.<ref name=\"Dern\" />\n\n==Reception==\n===Release===\n''We Don\u2019t Live Here Anymore'' premiered in January 2004 at the Sundance Film Festival,<ref name=\"UT\">{{cite news |last1=Fox |first1=Doug |title=Actors talk about Sundance film 'We Don't Live Here Anymore' |url=https://www.heraldextra.com/lifestyles/2004/aug/11/actors-talk-about-sundance-film-we-dont-live-here-anymore/ |access-date=24 September 2022 |work=[[Daily Herald (Utah)|Daily Herald]] |date=August 11, 2004 |page=B1}}</ref> where it won the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award for Larry Gross.<ref name=\"award\">{{cite news |title=Thriller 'Primer' Wins Grand Jury Prize at Sundance |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-jan-25-me-sundance25-story.html |access-date=24 September 2022 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 25, 2004}}</ref> [[Warner Independent Pictures]] purchased distribution rights for the film and it was given a limited theatrical release on August 13, 2004.<ref name=\"UT\" />\n\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''We Don\u2019t Live Here Anymore'' has an approval rating of 65% based on 127 reviews. Its consensus states, \"''We Don't Live Here Anymore'' is often overly moody and grim, but it's made watchable by the strong performances for its four principal actors.\"<ref name=\"RT\">{{cite web |title=We Don't Live Here Anymore |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/we_dont_live_here_anymore |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=24 September 2022}}</ref>\n\nWriting for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', [[Todd McCarthy]] said \"Ruffalo, in his underplayed manner, fully reveals the man in all his desires, hesitations and heartaches in relation to both his wife and lover. He's matched exceptionally well by the shimmering Watts, who once again displays her quicksilver acting ability to slip from one telling mood to the next. She has superb moments here.\"<ref name=variety/>\n\nIn his review, [[Roger Ebert]] was more critical, writing the film\u2019s problem is \"that it's too desultory. Maybe the point of the Dubus stories was to show perfunctory transgressions between characters not sufficiently motivated to accept the consequences. They approach adultery the way they might approach a treadmill, jumping on, punching the speed and incline buttons, working up a sweat, coming back down to level, slowing to a walk, and then deciding the damn thing isn't worth the trouble.\"<ref name=\"RE\">{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=Story gets lost along the way in whiny 'Anymore' |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/we-dont-live-here-anymore-2004 |website=RogerEbert.com |access-date=24 September 2022 |date=August 20, 2004}}</ref> However, he added, \"What must be said is that the actors are better than the material. There are four specific people here, each one closely observed and carefully realized. Ruffalo's Jack, driven by his lust, finds his needs fascinating to himself; Naomi Watts' Edith finds them fascinating to her. Terry and Hank seem almost forced into their halfhearted affair, and Laura Dern and Peter Krause are precise in the way they show dutiful excitement in each other's presence, while Dern vibrates with anger and passion in her arguments with her husband.\"<ref name=\"RE\" />\n\n=== Accolades ===\nLaura Dern won [[Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] at the [[Boston Society of Film Critics Awards 2004|Boston Society of Film Critics Awards]], in a tie with [[Sharon Warren]] for ''[[Ray (film)|Ray]]''.<ref name=\"Boston\">{{cite news |last1=Kimmel |first1=Daniel |title=Boston film critics flip for 'Sideways' |url=https://variety.com/2004/film/news/boston-film-critics-flip-for-sideways-1117914867/ |access-date=24 September 2022 |work=Variety |date=2004-12-12}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://wip.warnerbros.com/wedontlive/ Official website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050911194017/http://wip.warnerbros.com/wedontlive/ |date=2005-09-11 }}\n* {{IMDb title|0361309}}\n* ''[https://www.allmovie.com/movie/we-dont-live-here-anymore-v287908 We Don't Live Here Anymore]'' at [[AllMovie]]\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|we_dont_live_here_anymore}}\n* {{Mojo title|wedontlivehereanymore}}\n\n{{John Curran}}\n\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2004 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Films based on short fiction]]\n[[Category:Films based on multiple works]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Curran]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Michael Convertino]]\n[[Category:Films set in Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Warner Independent Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Sundance Film Festival award winners]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:2004 independent films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:Adultery in films]]\n[[Category:Films about couples]]"}]}}}}
