Produced and directed by [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], it is the [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|21st Disney animated feature film]] and the first entirely \"post-[[Walt Disney|Walt]]\" animated feature, as [[Walt Disney]] was involved in the production of both ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' (1967) and ''[[The Aristocats]]'' (1970) before his death in 1966. The story follows the adventures of [[Robin Hood (Disney character)|Robin Hood]], [[Little John]], and the inhabitants of [[Nottingham]] as they fight against the excessive taxation of [[John, King of England|Prince John]], and Robin Hood wins the hand of [[Maid Marian]]. The film features the voices of [[Brian Bedford]], [[Phil Harris]], [[Peter Ustinov]], [[Pat Buttram]], [[Monica Evans]], and [[Carole Shelley]].\n\nThe idea to adapt ''Robin Hood'' into an animated feature was dated back to [[Walt Disney]]'s interest in the tale of [[Reynard|Reynard the Fox]] during the theatrical release of his first full-length feature production, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937). The idea was repeatedly shelved until writer and production designer [[Ken Anderson (animator)|Ken Anderson]] incorporated ideas from it in a pitch of the legend of [[Robin Hood]] using [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals rather than humans during the previous production of ''[[The Aristocats]]'' (1970).\n\n''Robin Hood'' was released on November 8, 1973. The film was a commercial success but received mixed reviews.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature film articles should be between 400 and 700 words in length. Current word count is 616 words. -->\nThe story is narrated by [[Alan-a-Dale]]. He introduces [[Robin Hood (Disney character)|Robin Hood]] and [[Little John]], who live in [[Sherwood Forest]], robbing from the rich and giving to the overtaxed townsfolk of [[Nottingham]]. The [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] tries to catch the two, but he fails every time. Meanwhile, [[John, King of England|Prince John]] and his counselor Sir Hiss arrive in Nottingham. Earlier, Sir Hiss hypnotized Prince John's brother [[Richard I of England|King Richard]] to fight in the [[ third crusade]], allowing Prince John to take the throne as ''[[de facto]]'' King. Unfortunately, the Prince is greedy and immature, even sucking his thumb whenever his [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|mother]] is mentioned. Robin and Little John rob Prince John by disguising themselves as fortune tellers, prompting the Prince to put a bounty on their heads.\n\nThe Sheriff, under Prince John's orders, taxes the inhabitants of Nottingham excessively. However, Robin gives back some money to a family of rabbits, and gives a bow, arrow and one of his hats to the young rabbit Skippy for his birthday. Skippy and his two sisters and his friend, Toby, test out the bow, but Skippy accidentally fires the arrow into the grounds of Nottingham Castle. The children sneak inside, meeting [[Maid Marian]] and her [[lady-in-waiting]] Lady Kluck. Marian reveals that she and Robin were once childhood sweethearts, but she was sent to London and has not seen him for years, only recently returning to Nottingham and assuming Robin has forgotten her.\n\n[[Friar Tuck]], the local priest, visits Robin and Little John to report that Prince John is hosting an archery tournament, with a kiss from Maid Marian as the prize. Robin disguises himself as a [[stork]] and enters the contest, while Little John masquerades as the Duke of Chutney to get close to Prince John. Robin wins the tournament, but Prince John recognizes and exposes him, sentencing him to death despite Marian's pleas. Little John threatens Prince John with a dagger, resulting in a fight between Robin's forces and Prince John's soldiers, culminating in Robin's party escaping with Marian and Lady Kluck in tow.\n\nIn the forest, Robin and Marian share a romantic evening, then are surprised by Robin's \"[[merry men]]\", who sing a funny song dubbing John the \"Phony King of England\". Prince John learns of the song and furiously triples the taxes; most of the town cannot pay, and are imprisoned. The Sheriff visits Friar Tuck's church to steal from the [[poor box]]; Tuck throws him out and attacks him with a [[quarterstaff]], resulting in Tuck's arrest for \"treason\". Prince John learns of this, and orders Tuck's execution, hoping to lure Robin into doing something rash to save him.\n\nThe night before the execution, despite the precautions of Prince John, Robin Hood and Little John sneak into the castle. Little John manages to free all of the prisoners, Tuck included, whilst Robin steals all of Prince John's gold. Hiss awakens, and tries to stop them, rousing the castle. Chaos ensues as Robin and the others try to escape to Sherwood Forest, and Robin is forced to return to the castle to rescue Skippy's sister, Tagalong. The Sheriff chases Robin through the building and attacks him with a lit torch, setting the castle ablaze and forcing Robin to jump into the [[moat]]. Little John and Skippy anxiously watch as the water is pelted with arrows, and for a moment, it seems as if Robin has been killed, but he eventually emerges unharmed. Hiss chides a despairing Prince John for his failed trap, and points out the castle (belonging to Prince John's mother) is afire, which drives Prince John to insanity.\n\nLater, King Richard returns to England, and sentences Prince John, Hiss, and the Sheriff to [[hard labor]] in the Royal Rock Pile. He pardons Robin Hood, who marries Maid Marian and leaves Nottingham, with Little John and Skippy in tow.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[Brian Bedford]] as [[Robin Hood (Disney character)|Robin Hood]], a gifted archer and the leader of a band of rogues. He is portrayed as a [[red fox]].\n* [[Monica Evans]] as [[Maid Marian]], the niece of King Richard and love interest of Robin Hood. She is portrayed as a [[red fox|vixen]].\n* [[Phil Harris]] as [[Little John]], Robin Hood's best friend. He is portrayed as a [[brown bear]].\n* [[Roger Miller]] as [[Alan-a-Dale]], a minstrel who serves as the narrator of the film. He is portrayed as a [[rooster]].\n* [[Andy Devine]] as [[Friar Tuck]], the priest of Nottingham. He is portrayed as a [[European Badger|badger]].\n* [[Peter Ustinov]] as [[John of England|Prince John]], the [[Prince regent|Prince Regent]] of England.

Unlike John, Richard is depicted with a [[mane (lion)|mane]].\n* [[Terry-Thomas]] as Sir Hiss, Prince John's advisor. Portrayed as a [[snake]].\n* [[Carole Shelley]] as Lady Kluck, the [[lady-in-waiting]] of Maid Marian. She is portrayed as a [[chicken|hen]].\n* [[Pat Buttram]] as the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]]. He is portrayed as a [[wolf]].\n* [[George Lindsey]] and [[Ken Curtis]] as Trigger and Nutsy, respectively, the Sheriff's guardsmen. They are portrayed as [[vulture]]s.\n* Billy Whitaker, Dana Laurita, Dori Whitaker, and Richie Sanders as Skippy, Sis, Tagalong, and Toby, respectively, local children of Nottingham who idolize Robin Hood.

They are portrayed as [[house mouse|church mice]].\n**Luddy also voices Mrs. Rabbit (Skippy, Sis, and Tagalong's mother).\n* [[Candy Candido]] as the Captain of the Royal Guard. He is portrayed as a [[crocodile]].\n* [[J. Pat O'Malley]] as Otto the [[blacksmith]]. He is portrayed as a [[bloodhound]].\n\n== Production ==\n{{Quote box|width =33%|quote=\"As director of story and character concepts, I knew right off that sly Robin Hood must be a fox. From there it was logical that Maid Marian should be a pretty vixen. Little John, legendarily known for his size, was easily a big overgrown bear.\n\nFriar Tuck is great as a badger, but he was also great as a pig, as I had originally planned. Then I thought the symbol of a pig might be offensive to the [[Catholic Church|Church]], so we changed him. Richard the Lion-hearted, of course, had to be a regal, proud, strong lion; and his pathetic cousin [historically, and in the movie, his brother] Prince John, the weak villain, also had to be a lion, but we made him scrawny and childish. I originally thought of a snake as a member of the poor townspeople but one of the other men here suggested that a snake would be perfect as a slithering consort [Sir Hiss] to mean Prince John.\"|source=Ken Anderson{{sfn|Grant|1998|p=290}}}}\n\nAround the time of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' in 1937, [[Walt Disney]] became interested in adapting the twelfth-century legend of [[Reynard]] the Fox.{{sfn|Grant|1998|p=290}} However, the project languished due to Disney's concern that Reynard was an unsuitable choice for a hero.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harty|first=Kevin|date=2012|chapter=Walt in Sherwood, or the Sheriff of Disneyland: Disney and the film legend of Robin Hood.|title=The Disney Middle Ages: A Fairy-Tale and Fantasy Past|series=The New Middle Ages|edition=2012|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|isbn=978-0230340077|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ljMmuV2VUXwC&q=%22robin%20hood%22%20disney&pg=PA133 |editor1=Push, Tison |editor2=Aronstein, Susan}}</ref> In a meeting held on February 12, 1938, Disney commented: \"I see swell possibilities in 'Reynard', but is it smart to make it?

In the next decade, the studio decided to make Reynard the villain of a musical feature film based on [[Edmond Rostand]]'s ''[[Chantecler (play)|Chanticleer]]'', but the production was scrapped in favor of ''[[The Sword in the Stone (1963 film)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' (1963).{{sfn|Grant|1998|p=290}}\n\nIn October 1968, during a fishing trip with [[Ken Anderson (animator)|Ken Anderson]], studio executive [[Card Walker]] suggested that a \"classic\" tale should be the subject for the next animated film after ''[[The Aristocats]]'' (1970).
