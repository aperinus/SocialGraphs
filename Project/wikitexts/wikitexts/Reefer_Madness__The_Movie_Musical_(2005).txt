The ominous Lecturer informs the parents that he has come to warn them about the evils of [[marijuana]] on their youth ''(\"Reefer Madness\")'' through the tragic tale of one boy's struggles with the demon weed in a film titled [[Reefer Madness|''\"Tell Your Children\"'']]. Throughout the film, the Lecturer stops to detail a political point or to condescend any audience member questioning his credibility.\n\nJimmy Harper and Mary Lane, a joyful teen couple, blissfully enjoy each other's company ''(\"Romeo & Juliet\")'', unaware of the seedy goings-on in The Reefer Den across town. This is the residence of Mae, who is abused by her boyfriend, Jack, a street tough who supplies her and others with dope ''(\"The Stuff\")''. Mary, Jimmy and their school friends head to Miss Poppy's [[Five and Dime]], ''(\"Down at the Ol' Five and Dime\").'' Jack appears at the hangout, offering Jimmy swing lessons to impress Mary.\n\nJimmy is taken to the Reefer Den, where Jack, Mae, college dropout Ralph and neighborhood slut Sally pressure him into smoking his first joint, leading him to a hallucination of an insidious bacchanal. ''(\"Jimmy Takes a Hit/ The Orgy\")''. Jimmy turns into a crazed addict and neglects Mary, leading her to pray for him ''(\"Lonely Pew\").'' While breaking into a church to steal collection money, Jimmy has a vision of [[Jesus Christ]] in a Vegas-esque Heaven, telling him to change his ways or be sent to [[damnation|eternal damnation]] ''(\"Listen to Jesus, Jimmy\")''. Jimmy refuses to heed the word of God and continues to spiral into sin.\n\nOne night, Jimmy and Sally take a joy ride in Mary's stolen car while buzzed, running over an old man. Jimmy runs to Mary, debating whether to continue being under the influence or repent his ways ''(\"Mary Jane/ Mary Lane\").'' Jimmy returns to Mary romantically, but he realizes that he is putting her in danger and tells her that he must leave town without her. Jack brings him back to the Reefer Den with a [[Cannabis foods|pot-brownie]], putting him in a [[Golden Age of American animation|cartoonized]] trip ''(\"The Brownie Song\").'' Mary follows Jimmy to the Den where Ralph seduces her by convincing her that Jimmy has joined his \"[[Phi|frat]][[Beta|ern]][[Cannabis|ity]]\". He suggests that they celebrate with a smoke, which turns out to be a toke. This intro to reefer immediately turns Mary into a sadistic [[dominatrix]] who terrorizes Ralph for pleasure ''(\"Little Mary Sunshine)''. Jimmy enters and a fight ensues. Jack stops the fight, knocks out Jimmy and accidentally shoots Mary. He frames an unconscious Jimmy for the crime. Jimmy gives Mary his class ring, and comforts her as she dies in his arms ''(\"Mary's Death\")''.\n\nJimmy is taken away by police. Racked with guilt, Ralph has pot-induced hallucinations of Jimmy as a ghost, Mary as Satan's sodomy pal and the children who got hooked on the Reefer Gang's dope as the living dead. Ralph gets an extreme case of the munchies and cannibalizes Sally. Jack shoots Ralph to stop him ''(\"Murder!\")''. Seeing similar visions, Mae realizes the error of her ways and tells Jack to do the same. He rejects her pleas and she bludgeons him to death with a garden hoe, gaining her much-needed empowerment ''(\"The Stuff (Reprise)\").\n\nMae pleads to the visiting [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President]] about Jimmy's case, earning the boy a presidential [[pardon]]. Jimmy, Mae, the President and Jimmy's fellow prisoners, Ralph, Jack, and Sally (reincarnated as [[Uncle Sam]], [[George Washington]], and [[Statue of Liberty|Lady Liberty]] respectively) raise the American justice system and patriotism ''(\"Tell 'Em the Truth\")''. Jimmy burns down the Reefer Den's weed garden, freeing Mary from both Hell and [[Satan]] before everyone's eyes. The Lecturer's film ends with Mary entering Heaven, greeted by Jesus and other Holy souls.\n\nThe entire audience joins the suddenly real film cast to hold a huge anti-reefer [[bonfire|book burning]] pledging to join the fight against marijuana, sex, racial and ethnic minorities and other things harmful to their dear country ''(\"Finale\")''. The Lecturer drives off, pleased that he has succeeded in exploiting everyone's biases.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n\n===Principal cast===\n* [[Alan Cumming]] as The Lecturer, [[Moloch|The Goat Man]], [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], and other minor characters\n* [[Christian Campbell]] as James Fenimore \"Jimmy\" Harper\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as Mary Lane\n* [[Steven Weber]] as Jack Stone and [[George Washington]] in \"Tell 'Em the Truth\"\n* [[Ana Gasteyer]] as Mae Coleman\n* [[John Kassir]] as Ralph Wiley and [[Uncle Sam]] in \"Tell 'Em the Truth\"\n* [[Amy Spanger]] as Sally DeBanis and [[Statue of Liberty]] in \"Tell 'Em the Truth\"\n* [[Robert Torti]] as [[Jesus]]\n* [[Neve Campbell]] as Miss Poppy\n\n===Supporting cast===\n* Abraham Jedidiah as Dead Old Man\n* [[Christine Lakin]] as [[Joan of Arc]]\n* [[John Mann (musician)|John Mann]] as [[Satan]]\n* Harry S.

I turned to Kevin and said 'What about doing ''Reefer Madness'' as a musical?'\" By the time duo reached L.A., they had already written the first song.\n\nThe high school is named after [[Harry J. Anslinger]], the first Commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics, known as the Father of the Drug War.\n\n==Release==\n''Reefer Madness'' [[premiere]]d at the 2005 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It also screened in competition at the 2005 [[Deauville Film Festival]] and won the Premiere Audience Award. On April 20, four days following the film's television premiere, Showtime aired the musical back-to-back with the [[Reefer Madness|1936 exploitation film]] that inspired it.\n\nA limited theatrical release occurred internationally in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]]. The film made $8,972 in its short run.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0404364/|title = Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nShowtime released the [[DVD]] on November 9, 2005. The DVD includes the [[Reefer Madness|original film]] and an [[audio commentary]] by director Fickman with several cast members. The DVD case itself also smelled of brownies.\n\n===Accolades===\nThe film won the 2005 [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics|Music and Lyrics]] (for \"Mary Jane/Mary Lane\", which was written specially for the film). It also received Emmy nominations for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography|Choreography]] and Make-Up Effects.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nA soundtrack CD was first released by Showtime in their \"stash box\" press package.  Mixed from the 5.1 audio masters, this version has several anomalies including a few sound effects.\n\nOn October 28, 2008, [[Ghostlight Records]] released a double CD of the soundtrack from the film and original Los Angeles cast recording. The night before, [[The Public Theater]]'s [[Joe's Pub]] hosted a release party concert featuring a four-person ensemble and leads [[Alan Cumming]], [[Ana Gasteyer]], [[Christian Campbell]], [[John Kassir]], [[Robert Torti]], [[Amy Spanger]], and [[Jenna Leigh Green]] doing an abbreviated concert version with introductions to each song by Kevin Murphy.\n\nThe two versions of the soundtrack differ in quite a few places, both from each other and from the film, but it is most noticeable during the song ''Murder''. The Showtime CD features a longer version of the song, sans all spoken dialogue. The Ghostlight CD features a truncated version of the track littered with dialogue from the film.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0404364|Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|reefer_madness_2005|Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical}}\n\n{{Andy Fickman}}\n{{Satellite Award Best Television Film}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reefer Madness}}\n[[Category:2005 films]]\n[[Category:2005 television films]]\n[[Category:2000s musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy television films]]\n[[Category:American musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:Canadian comedy television films]]\n[[Category:Canadian musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about cannibalism]]\n[[Category:German television films]]\n[[Category:German musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:English-language Canadian films]]\n[[Category:English-language German films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Andy Fickman]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Nathan Wang]]\n[[Category:Films based on musicals based on films]]\n[[Category:Musical film remakes]]\n[[Category:Portrayals of Jesus in film]]\n[[Category:Showtime (TV network) original programming]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Franklin D.
