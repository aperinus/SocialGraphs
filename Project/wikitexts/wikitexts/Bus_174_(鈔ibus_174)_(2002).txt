It is the directorial debut of director [[Jos\u00e9 Padilha]] and co-director Felipe Lacerda.\n\n==Overview==\nIn 2000, [[Sandro Rosa do Nascimento|Sandro do Nascimento]], a young man from a poor background, held passengers on a bus [[hostage]] for four hours. The event was caught live on [[television]]. The movie examines the incident and what life is like in the slums and [[favelas]] of Rio de Janeiro and how the criminal justice system in [[Brazil]] treats the lower classes.  Within the film, Padilha interviews former and current street children, members of the Rio police force, the Rio [[Batalh\u00e3o de Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Policiais Especiais|BOPE]] police team, family members, and sociologists in order to gain insight into what led Nascimento to carry out the hijacking.\n\n==People involved==\n*Sandro\n*Julieta (aunt)\n*Dona Elza (adopted mother)\n*Janaina (hostage)\n*Willians (hostage)\n*Lucianna (hostage)\n*Luciana (hostage)\n*Daviana (hostage)\n*Geisa (hostage)\n*Soares (sociologist)\n*Yvonne (social worker)\n\n==Distribution==\n''Bus 174''{{'}}s distribution was supported mainly by U.S. distributor Cinemax Reel Life (HBO), and ThinkFilm. With the rise of U.S. distribution companies in Brazil, some say that domestic success of the film hinged on their support or that of Gob Filmes, a film production company founded in 1990 by Globo Television Networks.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tauris|first=I.B|title='Revisiting the \"realism\" of the cosmetics of hunger: Cidade de Deus and \u00d4nibus 174'}}</ref>\n\nAfter its release in 2002 at the S\u00e3o Paulo Film Festival, ''Bus 174'' was shown around the world, in many films festivals from Rio de Janeiro to Netherlands, and the Philippines. It received critical acclaim, and was presented with awards such as the 2004 Peabody Award and the Amnesty Award, in the Netherlands.\n\nThe film has also been featured as an Official Selection at the multiple [[film festival]]s including:\n\n* [[Palm Springs Film Festival|Palm Springs]] (2004)\n* [[Vancouver International Film Festival|Vancouver]] (2003)\n* [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] (2003)\n* [[Denver Film Festival|Starz Denver]] (2003)\n* [[Sydney Film Festival|Sydney]] (2003)\n* [[San Francisco International Film Festival|San Francisco]] (2003)\n\n==Reception==\n''Bus 174'' was voted \"one of the ten best films of the year\" by ''[[The New York Times]]''.
