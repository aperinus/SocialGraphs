After being arrested for organizing an underground [[rave]], she calls upon her godmother Judy Lindendorf to bail her out. In order for Mary to repay the loan, Judy employs her as a clerk at the library where she works. Mary reluctantly begins her new job while striking up a romance with Lebanese [[Street food|street vendor]] and aspiring teacher, Mustafa. Despite initial misgivings about work, Mary is inspired to learn how to use the [[Dewey Decimal System]] after smoking a [[Joint (cannabis)|joint]]. Gradually, she becomes very good at her job, but is later fired after having sex with Mustafa in the library. With no money to pay the accumulating rent, she and her roommate Leo, a club DJ, face eviction from their apartment. In desperation, Mary sells her vintage [[Haute couture|couture]] in order to pay the bills.\n\nDuring one of her parties, Mary takes drugs to forget a fight with Mustafa. The next day, she decides to get her life in order and become a librarian, and her fellow workers discuss a path of [[Master of Library and Information Science|graduate study]]. She invites Judy over to talk, but when they arrive, Mary discovers to her horror that her friends have thrown her a surprise birthday party, complete with a [[male stripper]]. Mary tells a skeptical Judy that she has finally found her calling in life, and Mustafa and Leo tell Judy that Mary used her [[library science]] skills to help them with their careers. Impressed, Judy gives Mary her job back, and joins the party.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Parker Posey]] as Mary\n* [[Anthony DeSando]] as Derrick\n* [[Guillermo D\u00edaz (actor)|Guillermo D\u00edaz]] as Leo\n* Donna Mitchell as Rene\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as Nigel\n* Omar Townsend as Mustafa\n* Sasha von Scherler as Judy Lindendorf\n* [[Becky Mode]] as Ann\n* [[Simon Verhoeven]] as Kurt\n\n==Production==\nThe film had a budget of $150,000<ref name=\"WSJ\">{{cite web |last=Saperstein |first=Ari |title=How the First Popular Movie Ever to Stream Online Was Made |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/party-girl-oral-history-parker-posey-11591621366 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=June 8, 2020 |access-date=June 9, 2020 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200608135245/https://www.wsj.com/articles/party-girl-oral-history-parker-posey-11591621366 |archive-date=June 8, 2020}}</ref> and was shot in 19 days.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Kyle|url=https://www.avclub.com/guillermo-diaz-1798219220|title=Guillermo Diaz|website=[[The A.V.

In an interview with ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Posey recalls that in the early 1990s she \"would go out rollerblading at [[The Roxy (New York City)|The Roxy]] on Sundays and to [the party] Love Machine, where I first saw [[RuPaul]]\", and that, much like in ''Party Girl''{{'s}} club scenes, Posey \"would dance with the queens, and they would just annihilate me on the dance floor with their moves.\"<ref name=\"WSJ\"/>\n\nAccording to director Daisy von Scherler Meyer, \"the fashion was really invented for the film. [Michael Clancy] created an aesthetic for the character and for the movie and combined that with Parker Posey's own fashion obsession.\"<ref name=\"WSJ\"/> Posey says that they relied on favors to assemble the outfits: \"The wardrobe designer, Michael Clancy, and his assistant Vicky Farrell ... pulled a lot of things from their friends\", such as designer [[Todd Oldham]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Sellitti |first=Renata |title=Parker Posey on Her Eccentric Look in Party Girl |url=https://www.thecut.com/2015/04/parker-posey-on-her-eccentric-look-in-party-girl.html |website=[[The Cut (website)|The Cut]] |date=April 15, 2015 |access-date=June 9, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200609202141/https://www.thecut.com/2015/04/parker-posey-on-her-eccentric-look-in-party-girl.html |archive-date=June 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Internet debut===\n''Party Girl'' premiered on the Internet on June 3, 1995,<ref name=\"dazed\"/> transmitted from Glenn Fleishman's Point of Presence Company (POPCO). Appearing live in the POPCO offices, Posey welcomed Internet viewers and then introduced the film. Fleishman recalled the event:\n:I helped launch the first official full-length [Internet] movie premiere in 1995 in my offices in Seattle. The film was broadcast to several hundred people worldwide over a [[CU-SeeMe]] reflector at Point of Presence Company's offices in downtown and then a few minutes, it was projected at The Egyptian in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. Parker Posey was in our offices to hit the start button on the broadcast. I was one cog in a larger set of wheels that involved the [[Seattle International Film Festival]], Film.com (now part of [[RealNetworks]]), First Look Releasing, and the film's producers, as well as another online development company and a [[CUSeeMe]] engineering consultant, Joseph Kahan who also worked at NASA down in Texas. The launch was shown on ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' in a five-minute segment at the bottom of the Sunday broadcast that week.<ref>{{cite web |last=Fleishman |first=Glenn |url=https://glog.glennf.com/blog/2003/09/06/first_film_premiered_on_internet |title=First Film Premiered on Internet? |website=Glenn Fleishman Writes Words About Things |date=September 6, 2003 |access-date=November 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nMuch of the film takes place in clubs and at parties, and a supporting character is a DJ. There are many scenes directly discussing or playing music appropriate to the mid-1990s club scene, several local performers, and most music is [[Diegesis|diegetic]], being clearly played in the scene.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Posey says she often gets approached by librarians who are fans of the film: \"Librarians and people who work in bookstores are like 'Oh my God, thank you so much. ''Party Girl'' made me want to become a librarian.'\"<ref name=\"WSJ\"/> Von Scherler Meyer believes ''Party Girl'' resonates with audiences because of the film's authentic depiction of underrepresented communities: \"When people say 'Oh, the world [in ''Party Girl''] is so diverse,' it's like 'No. That's the world. You don't represent the world in your stuff. Why is your world so segregated?' I think the world is messed up, and ''Party Girl'' is normal.\"<ref name=\"WSJ\"/> On the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 79% based on 34 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10.<ref>{{cite web |title=Party Girl |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1066050_party_girl |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=September 12, 2022}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural influence===\nThe film often is noted for its influence on fashion, particularly in the case of Mary's wardrobe.<ref name=\"Nahman2017\">{{cite web | last=Nahman | first=Haley | title='Party Girl' is the Ultimate Fashion Movie | website=Man Repeller | date=2017-06-09 | url=https://www.manrepeller.com/2017/06/parker-posey-party-girl-fashion.html | access-date=2020-06-14}}</ref><ref name=\"Hess\">{{cite web | last=Hess | first=Liam | title=25 Years Later, the Makers of ''Party Girl'' Reflect on the Film's Enduring Fashion Legacy | work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] | url=https://www.vogue.com/article/party-girl-25th-anniversary-parker-posey | date=June 10, 2020 | access-date=2020-06-14}}</ref>\n\n==Television spin-off==\n{{Main|Party Girl (1996 TV series)}}\nA television series based on the film was produced in 1996, starring [[Christine Taylor]] as Mary and [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as Judy.
