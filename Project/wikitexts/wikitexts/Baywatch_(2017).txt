Mitch Buchannon and his team of lifeguards, including second-in-command Stephanie Holden and veteran C.J. Parker, protect the beaches and the bay as part of an elite division known as Baywatch.\n\nWith over 500 rescues in his career, Mitch is beloved by the community, annoying beat cop Garner Ellerbee and his superior, Captain Thorpe. On morning patrol, Mitch finds a small pouch of [[Alpha-Pyrrolidinopentiophenone|flakka]] by the Huntley Club, now owned by businesswoman Victoria Leeds, who has been bribing city councilman Rodriguez and others to control the bay.\n\nMitch later meets Matt Brody, who thinks being an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medal-winning swimmer entitles him to be on the team without trying out. He and Holden tease him, Mitch later makes Brody try to beat him on the \"big boys'\" course. As the course is ending, a mom and her kids start drowning, so the lifeguards and Brody rush in to save them, although Brody isn't a lifeguard yet. Finally, those who made the tryouts are Ronnie Greenbaum, Summer Quinn, and Brody.\n\nWhen a private yacht catches fire, the occupants are evacuated, except for deceased councilman Rodriguez. Ellerbee disapproves of Mitch's further investigative actions. After Mitch and the gang attend Leeds' party without finding out about the flakka, Mitch, Brody, and Summer later infiltrate the hospital morgue. Videoing Leeds' henchmen planting an autopsy report to cover up Rodriguez's murder, they are unfortunately discovered, the recording is destroyed and Ellerbee releases their suspect on a lack of evidence. Angered, Thorpe threatens to fire Mitch if he oversteps again.\n\nConvinced Leeds is running drugs through the Huntley, Mitch and Brody go undercover. In the kitchen, they witness the drugs being retrieved from barrels of fish. Contacting Ellerbee, they learn another dead body has been found on the beach. Thorpe, enraged that Mitch essentially deserted his post, fires him, naming Brody the new lieutenant. Brody doesn't want the job but is forced to take it and Mitch takes a phone store job.\n\nBrody later sees \"sand grifters (beach thieves)\" steal bags using a cooler. He orders them off the beach, and keeps the cooler. After finding another pouch of flakka on the beach, Brody takes the second victim's report from Ellerbee using the cooler and brings it to Summer, who confirms the man was killed by knife instead of a shark attack. Ronnie, recognizing the victim as his friend Dave, realizes that Ronnie had told Brody that Dave was working the Leeds for the Huntley. Brody realizes that Mitch was right about the Huntley, before Ronnie helps Brody hack into Leeds' servers, and finds her plan to privatize the entire beach by eliminating the competition.\n\nThe team, infiltrating a private party on Leeds' personal yacht, discover that she's been using the hull to smuggle the drugs. Captured, Brody is tied up and put in a bait cage, and a gloating Leeds reveals she bribed Thorpe to replace Mitch with Brody before pushing the cage into the water. Before Brody can drown, Summer swims to him to give him the [[mouth-to-mouth resuscitation|kiss of life]]. However, he's hallucinating and realizes it is actually Mitch.\n\nThey catch up to Leeds, while Ronnie and C. J. launch fireworks at her escape helicopter. As they run out, a wounded Mitch, having intentionally stung himself with a [[sea urchin]] to boost his adrenaline, uses a [[Roman candle (firework)|Roman candle]] to blow Leeds up. Ellerbee arrives, takes her henchmen into custody, and apologizes to Mitch for doubting him. Thorpe arrives, berating Mitch for returning to the beach despite being fired. In response, Brody punches him in the face and Thorpe is subsequently arrested for his role in Leeds' plan.\n\nSometime later, Ronnie and Brody begin relationships with C.J. and Summer respectively. Mitch, reinstated, announces that Summer, Ronnie, and Brody are no longer trainees and introduces them to their new captain, [[Pamela Anderson|Casey Jean]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- opening title card order at start of film, role names per closing credits -->\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as Lieutenant [[Mitch Buchannon]]\n* [[Zac Efron]] as Matt Brody\n* [[Priyanka Chopra]] as Victoria Leeds\n* [[Alexandra Daddario]] as Summer Quinn\n* [[Jon Bass (actor)|Jon Bass]] as Ronnie Greenbaum\n* [[Kelly Rohrbach]] as [[C.
