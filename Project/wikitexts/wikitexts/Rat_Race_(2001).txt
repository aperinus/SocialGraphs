Inspired by [[Stanley Kramer]]'s 1963 film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'',{{not verified in body|date=September 2022}} the film features an [[ensemble cast]] consisting of [[Rowan Atkinson]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]], [[Wayne Knight]], [[Jon Lovitz]], [[Kathy Najimy]], [[Lanei Chapman]], [[Breckin Meyer]], [[Amy Smart]], [[Seth Green]], [[Vince Vieluf]], [[John Cleese]] and [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]].\n\nThe film centers on six teams of people who are given the task of racing {{convert|563|mi}} from a [[Las Vegas]] casino to a [[Silver City, New Mexico]] train station where a storage locker contains a [[duffel bag]] filled with $2 million. Each team is given a key to the locker and the first person to reach the locker gets the money.\n\nProduced by [[Fireworks Entertainment|Fireworks Pictures]], [[Sean Daniel|Alphaville Films]] and Zucker's [[Jerry Zucker (film director)|Zucker Productions]], the film was released theatrically by [[Paramount Pictures]] on August 17, 2001, in the United States and Canada.

He arranges for six competitors to race the {{convert| 563 |miles|km|abbr=out}} to [[Silver City, New Mexico]], where $2 million is in a train station locker. Sinclair's guests place bets on who will win.\n\nThe racers consist of con-artist brothers Duane and Blaine Cody, businesswoman Merrill Jennings and her mother Vera, football [[referee]] Owen Templeton, Randy Pear and his family, [[narcoleptic]] Italian tourist Enrico Pollini, and no-nonsense [[lawyer|attorney]] Nick Schaffer. Having initially agreed not to play, greed takes over and they start to race.\n\nDuane and Blaine destroy the airport [[radar]], grounding everybody else but wrecking their vehicle so they steal another. They split up to better their chances. They have a [[locksmithing|locksmith]] create a duplicate locker key but he overhears their plan and makes off with the key in a [[hot air balloon]]. The brothers catch him and leave him and a stray cow hanging from the balloon's anchor rope. Their car is crushed by a monster truck which they then steal.\n\nMerrill and Vera are given malicious directions and crash. They steal a [[rocket car]] until it runs out of fuel, then stumble onto a busload of mental patients headed for Silver City.\n\nOwen is kicked out of a taxi for his [[bad call]] at a football game that caused the driver to lose his bet. He impersonates the driver of a busload of [[Lucille Ball]] [[cosplay]]ers. He hits the cow dangling from the balloon and crashes. He reveals that he is not the real driver and the enraged women chase him. He escapes and steals a horse to ride to Silver City.\n\nRandy and his family, at the insistence of their daughter, visit a museum to Nazi [[Klaus Barbie]], believing it to be about [[Barbie|Barbie the doll]]. They steal [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[staff car]] after Duane and Blaine [[sabotage]] their vehicle. When his family insist they end the trip, Randy drugs them with [[hypnotic|sleeping pills]] and bundles them into a [[Semi-trailer truck|semi-truck]].\n\nNick chooses not to participate but changes his mind when he meets Tracy Faucet, who gives him a lift in her [[helicopter]]. She uses it to attack her cheating boyfriend, then having damaged the helicopter she and Nick steal the boyfriend's truck and form a romantic relationship while driving to Silver City.\n\nEnrico is more excited by the race than the money but falls asleep at the start, only waking hours later. He gets a ride from Zack, an [[ambulance]] driver delivering a [[Organ transplantation|transplant heart]]. Enrico inadvertently drops the heart out of the window, whereupon it is stolen by a dog, which is then [[Electrocution|electrocuted]] on an [[electric fence]]. Zack decides to kill Enrico to replace the missing heart. Enrico escapes by boarding a passing train where he drops his key in a baby's [[diaper]] and, retrieving it, is mistaken for a [[Pedophilia|pedophile]]. He is thrown out at Silver City station and is the first to reach the locker, only to fall asleep upon unlocking it.\n\nThe racers reunite in Silver City and fight to open the locker only to find it empty. Outside, Sinclair's assistant Grisham and [[call girl]] Vicki are making off with the money. The locksmith maneuvers the balloon to drop the cow on Grisham and ties the money bag to the balloon. The racers chase the balloon to a [[Smash Mouth]] [[benefit concert|charity concert]]. The band and crowd mistake the money for a donation. Once the racers see the charitable good spirit engendered they are persuaded to donate. Nick horrifies Sinclair and his patrons by announcing that Sinclair and the gamblers will match the money raised. Sinclair is distraught as the donations total shoots past $19 million while the racers dance to \"[[All Star (song)|All Star]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n;Main\n{{div col}}\n* [[John Cleese]] as Donald P.
