It stars [[Felissa Rose]], [[Katherine Kamhi]], Paul DeAngelo, [[Mike Kellin]] (in his last screen appearance), and [[Christopher Collet]] (in his first).\n\nReleased during the heyday of slasher movies, the film is known for its infamous [[twist ending]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thecinemaholic.com/best-horror-movie-plot-twists-time/|last=Kumar|first=Sharath|title=25 Best Horror Movie Twist Endings - Best Twist Endings in Horror Movies|publisher=The Cinemaholic|date=July 28, 2017|accessdate=July 12, 2021}}</ref> considered to be one of the genre's most shocking. Since its release, the film received a positive critical response and a cult following. It was followed by four sequels, ''[[Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers]]'' (1988), ''[[Sleepaway Camp III: Teenage Wasteland]]'' (1989), ''[[Return to Sleepaway Camp]]'' (2008), and ''[[Sleepaway Camp IV: The Survivor]]'' (2012).\n\n==Plot==\nOver the opening credits, the camera pans over a deserted campsite in autumn, as sounds of camp activities during the summer are heard. Eventually, it comes to a stop on a sign outside the campsite: \"CAMP ARAWAK\u2014FOR SALE\".\n\nIn summer 1975, John Baker and his partner Lenny take John's children Angela and Peter on a boating trip near Camp Arawak, where the two siblings prank their father by capsizing their boat. They attempt to swim ashore where Lenny is waiting for them, but camp counselor Mary Ann, driving a speedboat and not paying attention, runs into them. John is killed, and only one of the children survives.\n\nEight years later, in 1983, the now 14 year old Angela lives with her eccentric aunt, Dr. Martha Thomas, and Martha's son Ricky. Aunt Martha sends Angela to Camp Arawak for the first time, along with Ricky, who had attended the camp before. Upon arriving at Camp Arawak, the shy, meek and introverted Angela quickly becomes a target for ridicule and [[bullying]], mostly from her bunkmate Judy and their counselor Meg, while Angela's other counselor Susie and the camp's head counselor Ronnie do what they can to help her fit in. The [[pedophile]] head cook Artie takes Angela into the kitchen pantry, where he attempts to molest her, but is caught by Ricky, who runs out with Angela. Later, an unseen figure causes Artie to tip a pot of boiling water onto himself, leaving him with severe burns and in extreme agony. Camp owner Mel Kostic decides to cover up the event, in order not to frighten the campers.\n\nWhen campers Kenny and Mike mock Angela, Ricky and his best friend Paul fight them until their counselor Gene intervenes. After the brawl, Paul stops to befriend Angela and, when he tells her goodnight, she tells him goodnight as well, speaking for the first time. That night, after pranking a girl named Leslie by tipping her boat, Kenny is drowned by an unseen assailant. When lifeguard Hal finds his corpse the next day, Mel insists his death was accidental, but Ronnie and police officer Frank are skeptical. Meanwhile, Paul continues bonding with Angela and asks her to attend the mandatory movie night with him, which she accepts. After the movie, Paul walks Angela to her cabin and gives her two goodnight kisses, taking her by surprise.\n\nAfter campers Billy and Mike throw water balloons at Angela, Billy is stung to death when a mysterious figure traps him in a bathroom stall and drops a [[Beehive|hive]] of [[bee]]s into it. Mel suspects a killer is in the camp.\n\nThat night, Paul and Angela playfully run around the lakeshore, but when Paul begins making out with Angela, she has a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to when she and her sibling witnessed their father in bed with Lenny; she rejects his advances and runs off, leaving him confused. The next day, during a flag game, Judy takes her chance to seduce Paul and Angela finds the two of them kissing. Paul attempts to explain himself to Angela after a swimming session, but Judy and Meg shoo him away and throw Angela into the water. After Ricky rescues her, children fling sand at them. Ricky comforts Angela and swears revenge on her aggressors.\n\nMeg is stabbed to death in the shower while getting ready to meet Mel. At that night\u2019s social, Paul apologizes to Angela for what happened earlier with Judy, and she tells him to meet her at the waterfront later. Meanwhile, the children who threw sand at Angela and Ricky are camping in the woods with their counselor Eddie when two of them ask him to take them back to the main camp. When he returns, he discovers the four remaining children have been hacked to death with his hatchet. Back at the camp, the killer enters Judy's cabin and murders her, [[rape|raping]] her with a hot curling iron while smothering her with a pillow. Meanwhile, Mel finds Meg's dead body and, convinced that the killer is Ricky after hearing him swear vengeance against Angela's tormentors, severely beats him before escaping into the woods. However, he is confronted by the killer, whom he is shocked to recognize, and is killed with an arrow through the throat.\n\nFrank, having been informed of the situation, searches the campsite with the counselors for other victims and the killer; they discover Ricky unconscious and injured, but alive. Meanwhile, Paul is at the waterfront with Angela, who suggests they go skinny dipping, so they undress. Ronnie and Susie, while perlustrating the campsite, find Angela sitting on the lakeshore with Paul, who appears to be resting in her lap as she tenderly strokes his hair, humming quietly.\n\nAnother flashback shows Aunt Martha welcoming the survivor of the boat accident into her home, who is revealed to be Peter, not Angela; the real Angela was killed in the accident, and Aunt Martha, after taking custody of Peter, chose to raise him as his dead sister, since she did not want to raise another boy. Back in the present, \"Angela\" (who is actually Peter) drops Paul's severed head on the ground and stands up fully nude, holding a knife, covered in blood and with a [[Human penis|penis]] in plain view before the horrified Susie and Ronnie, growling with a frozen and deranged expression as the film ends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Felissa Rose]] as Angela / Peter Baker\n** Frank Sorrentino as young Peter\n** Colette Lee Corcoran as young Angela\n* [[Jonathan Tiersten]] as Ricky Thomas\n* Karen Fields as Judy\n* [[Christopher Collet]] as Paul\n* [[Mike Kellin]] as Mel Kostic\n* [[Katherine Kamhi]] as Meg\n* Paul DeAngelo as Ronnie Angelo\n* Susan Glaze as Susie\n* Amy Baio as Brooke Warner\n* Tom Van Dell as Mike\n* Loris Sallahian as Billy\n* John E.

If Peter had not been forced to live his life as 'Angela', the events of ''Sleepaway Camp'' would have been avoided\".<ref name=\"Colangelo 2019\" /> Colangelo clarifies that she is not arguing that [[gender dysphoria]] causes those experiencing it to become murderers, but rather that \"children experiencing gender dysphoria and living in non-affirming homes are prone to depression, thoughts of suicide, and yes, sometimes violent outbursts\".<ref name=\"Colangelo 2019\" />\n\nTransgender writer Alice Collins of ''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' stated that ''Sleepaway Camp'' \"is steeped in [[queerness]], especially when compared to its contemporaries. In its day it took a deeper look into the subject matter than that of other films. Angela and Peter's dad is a [[closeted]] gay man, there's forced [[gender bending]] (which is abuse rather than queer but people will see it as such), and the majority of the scantily clad people in the film are men with all those very short shorts that leave little to the imagination while there is little skin shown of the feminine variety\".<ref name=\"Collins 2020\">{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3625816/sleepaway-camp-elephant-room-trapped-gender/|title='Sleepaway Camp': The Elephant in the Room [Trapped By Gender]|last=Collins|first=Alice|date=August 21, 2020|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|access-date=August 31, 2021}}</ref> Collins argues that Angela is a [[transgender girl]], noting that, in the film's sequels, Angela is presented as a woman who uses feminine [[gender pronoun|pronouns]]: \"So despite Aunt Martha being insane, she just happened to stumble upon a person who was already a girl; and it was an accident that her brainwashing worked\".<ref name=\"Collins 2020\" />\n\n==Production==\nThe filming of ''Sleepaway Camp'' took place in [[Argyle, New York]] near Summit Lake at a camp formerly known as Camp Algonquin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fast-rewind.com/locations_sleepawaycamp.htm|title=Sleepaway Camp Locations|accessdate=July 12, 2021}}</ref> In interviews, screenwriter and director, Robert Hiltzik, has said that he attended that camp as a child.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://denofgeek.com/us/movies/sleepaway-camp/235963/robert-hiltzik-talks-the-making-of-slasher-classic-sleepaway-camp|title= Robert Hiltzik Talks the Making of Slasher Classic Sleepaway Camp|last=Kaye|first=Don|date=June 3, 2014|accessdate=July 12, 2021}}</ref> The movie was filmed in five weeks starting in September 1982 and ending in October of that year on a budget of $350,000.

The Jeff Hayes-directed film was included in the collector's edition Blu-ray release of the original ''Sleepaway Camp''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rowsdowr.com/2014/03/12/sleepaway-camp-collectors-edition-bluray-art-special-features/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210818101011/https://www.rowsdowr.com/2014/03/12/sleepaway-camp-collectors-edition-bluray-art-special-features/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2021-08-18|title=Sleepaway Camp Collector's Edition Blu-ray Art & Special Features|work=Rowsdowr|date=March 12, 2014|access-date=August 18, 2021}}</ref>\n\nAccording to horror-movie fansite Bloody Disgusting, a reboot of ''Sleepaway Camp'' is in the works, starring Felissa Rose.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-12-03|title=New 'Sleepaway Camp' Movie Is in the Works Says Original Star Felissa Rose|url=https://movieweb.com/sleepaway-camp-reboot-plans-felissa-rose/|access-date=2021-10-11|website=Movieweb|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Documentaries===\nA documentary film on the series, titled ''Angela: The Official Sleepaway Camp Documentary'', is currently in pre-production, with [[Felissa Rose]] as executive producer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.darkness.com/sleepaway-camp-documentary/|title=Sleepaway Camp Documentary|date=November 22, 2018 |publisher=Darkness|accessdate=July 12, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Works cited==\n* {{cite book|first=Jim|last=Harper|title=Legacy of Blood: A Comprehensive Guide to Slasher Movies|year=2004|location=Manchester|publisher=Critical Vision|isbn=978-1-900-48639-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kAxPsnCDPWgC|oclc=475680187}}\n* {{cite book|last=Paszylk|first=Bart\u0142omiej|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SWCx_jpxkdwC|title=The Pleasure and Pain of Cult Horror Films: An Historical Survey|isbn=978-0-786-43695-8|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|oclc=956654338}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipos|first=Thomas M.|title=Horror Film Aesthetics: Creating the Visual Language of Fear|year=2010|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-786-45834-9|oclc=607320273}}\n* {{cite book|last=Stine|first=Scott Aaron|title=The Gorehound's Guide to Splatter Films of the 1980s|year=2003|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-1-476-61132-7|oclc=606990002}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sumner|first=Don|year=2010|title=Horror Movie Freak|url=https://archive.org/details/horrormoviefreak00sumn|url-access=registration|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|oclc=775361341|isbn=978-1-440-21563-6}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.sleepawaycampmovies.com}}\n* {{IMDb title|0086320}}\n* {{Amg movie|45145}}\n\n{{Sleepaway Camp}}\n\n[[Category:1983 horror films]]\n[[Category:1983 independent films]]\n[[Category:1983 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1980s horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:1980s mystery films]]\n[[Category:1980s serial killer films]]\n[[Category:1980s slasher films]]\n[[Category:1980s teen horror films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American slasher films]]\n[[Category:American teen LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:American teen horror films]]\n[[Category:Backwoods slasher films]]\n[[Category:Films about bullying]]\n[[Category:Films about cousins]]\n[[Category:Films about dysfunctional families]]\n[[Category:Films about pranks]]\n[[Category:Films about sexual repression]]\n[[Category:Films about siblings]]\n[[Category:Films about summer camps]]\n[[Category:American films about revenge]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1975]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1983]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related horror films]]\n[[Category:Sleepaway Camp (film series)]]\n[[Category:Transgender-related films]]\n[[Category:1983 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related controversies in film]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
