The film premiered at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] in May 2012.

One of her few friends is Rick, a slightly simple young man living with his parents in a nearby house.\n\nSkunk is shocked when Rick gets beaten up by single-father Mr. Oswald, another neighbour: one of three of his daughters has falsely accused Rick of rape. He is released when she is proven a liar, but he closes himself off. From then on Skunk's life goes downhill.\n\nKasia splits up with her boyfriend Mike, who is also Skunk's favourite teacher. Rick is put into a mental ward as he isolates himself more and more. Archie and Kasia are beginning a relationship, a shock to both Mike and Skunk. Oswald's daughters start bullying Skunk when the new term starts. Her first boyfriend suddenly has to move away, and does not tell her until the day before he leaves.\n\nOne of Oswald's daughters gets pregnant by one of her many sexual partners, panics, and falsely accuses Mike. Oswald barges into Skunk's classroom and beats Mike. While Oswald is in jail, Archie provides legal services to Mike, and the three daughters throw a drunken party. The pregnant daughter miscarries, then dies, leading to Oswald's release.\n\nSkunk secretly visits Rick when he has his first weekend at home. When she enters the house, she finds that Rick has accidentally broken his mother's neck, pushing her down the stairs, then panicked and knocked out his father. He won't let Skunk leave and does not realise Skunk's diabetes takes her into a [[hypoglycemia|hypoglycemic coma]]. Oswald finds Skunk, and a dead Rick (suicide), and gets her to hospital.\n\nIn a dream sequence, Skunk bids farewell to people from her childhood, including the recently dead, then sees her grown self, holding her baby. She wakes up in the hospital, with her father at her side.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n*[[Tim Roth]] as Archie\n*[[Cillian Murphy]] as Mike Kiernan\n*[[Rory Kinnear]] as Bob Oswald\n*[[Robert Emms]] as Rick\n*[[Zana Marjanovi\u0107]] as Kasia\n*[[Clare Burt]] as Mrs Buckley\n*[[Bill Milner]] as Jed\n*[[Denis Lawson]] as Mr Buckley\n*Eloise Laurence as Skunk\n*[[Michael Shaeffer]] as Desk Sergeant\n*Martha Bryant as Sunrise\n*[[Faye Daveney]], as Saskia\n*Rosalie Kosky-Hensman as Susan\n*[[Lily James]] as older Skunk\n\n==Reception==\n===Accolades===\n''Broken'' premiered at the Cannes Film Festival 2012.
