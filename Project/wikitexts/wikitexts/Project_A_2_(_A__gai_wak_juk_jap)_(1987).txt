It is the sequel to the 1983 film ''[[Project A (film)|Project A]]''. Jackie Chan plays Sergeant Dragon Ma once again, but his co-stars from the previous film, [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]], are absent. The film was released on 19 August 1987.\n\n==Plot==\nContinuing from where the first film left off, the pirates vow that they must kill Dragon Ma for revenge. On recommendation of the Chief of Marine Force, Dragon Ma is transferred to be in charge of the district of Sai Wan after the Superintendent, Chun, is thought to be staging his arrests. Though Chun has an excellent record, the \"criminals\" he has been engaging are shot and killed, so there is no evidence against him.\n\nDragon Ma and his subordinates meet Yesan and her cousin, Carina, at a teahouse. He learns that Carina is a member of the Chinese revolutionaries headed by Dr Sun Yat-sen. Dragon identifies himself as the new superintendent of Sai Wan Police Station, after realizing that all of his policemen except one has been taking bribes. Ho, the only upright policeman around, tells them that a gangster named Tiger Ow with gambling dens and other illegal businesses is the kingpin of the town.\n\nAs his men at the police station are too cowardly, Dragon is forced to confront Tiger with only Ho and the three friends he brought with him from the Marine Police. Following a big fight where the policemen are badly outnumbered, the Marine Police show up with guns and force the gangsters to surrender. After one last fight with Ow, all the gangsters are sent to prison, inspiring the police at the station to do a better job.\n\nDragon is put in charge of the Governor's security for a birthday ball he is throwing for his adopted daughter. Chun collaborates with a group of revolutionaries to implicate Dragon in a theft of the Governor's diamond pendant, and Dragon is arrested. After the ball, Carina is kidnapped by agents of the Empress Dowager, who are working with Chun; they trap her in a wardrobe at Yesan's house. Yesan, Li, Ma, and Ho arrive. Li hides but ends up threatened by one of the imperial agents. Ma and Ho, who are handcuffed together, enter the bathroom. While they are in the bathroom, the commissioner arrives.\n\nAs Yesan hangs up his uniform, Ma and Ho see the keys to the handcuffs. They break free and hide under the bed, losing the key to the handcuffs. They see the Imperial Agents with Carina in the wardrobe. Yesan and the commissioner sit down to talk. The Commissioner demonstrates how to handcuff two people by handcuffing himself to the armchair but can not break free. Chun arrives to visit Yesan, and the commissioner hides under the bed, where he sees Ma and Ho. Yesan finally gets Chun to get out of her house, when Ma, Ho, Tung and Yesan defeat the Imperial agents. Eventually the Imperial Agents are arrested, the revolutionary chief escapes, and Dragon is handcuffed by Chun so that he can be brought to the main prison. Carina flees town with the help of the revolutionaries. Chun arranges for Dragon to be killed by a prison warden.\n\nThe pirates attack both Dragon and Chun with axes, but they are eventually driven off after the police show up. Dragon is handed over to the prison warden, tied up in a sack, and thrown into the sea. The revolutionaries save Dragon and take him back to their hideout above a medicine store, where they try to enlist him. Dragon refuses to actively help them, saying that he is just a Hong Kong cop. The head of the pirates falls sick and the pirates enter the medicine store to ask for some herbs. Dragon intervenes and offers to pay for their medicine, causing the pirates to think much better of him.\n\nThe Imperial agents arrive and apprehend most of the revolutionaries, to gain possession of the black book. Dragon helps Yessan and Miss Pak escape while safeguarding the book.  After a frantic run and fight, he defeats them with the help of the pirates.  The Police Commissioner arrives with a huge police cohort and orders the arrest of Superintendent Chun, now fully aware Chun is trying to murder Dragon. Chun tries to run, but a large bamboo-and-wood stage facade falls on Chun while he attempts to retrieve his moneybag. Dragon, on order of the Commissioner, takes charge of the police.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jackie Chan]] \u2013 Sergeant Dragon Ma\n*[[Maggie Cheung]] \u2013 Yesan / Maggie\n*[[Bill Tung]] \u2013 Chief Inspector / Chief Tung\n*[[Rosamund Kwan]] \u2013 Miss Pak\n*{{Interlanguage link multi|David Lam Wai|lt=David Lam|zh|\u6797\u5a01}} \u2013 Superintentant/Inspector Chun\n*[[Carina Lau]] \u2013 Carina / Beattie\n*[[Ray Lui]] \u2013 Mr. Man Tin-ching\n*[[Regina Kent]] \u2013 Regina, Governor\u2019s daughter\n*[[Mars (actor)|Mars]] \u2013 Mars / Jaws\n*[[Kenny Ho]] \u2013 Shi King Ho\n*[[Bo\u017eidar Smiljani\u0107]] - Governor\n*Yao Lin Chen \u2013 Awesome Wolf\n*Chris Li \u2013 Mr. D (Ma's sidekick)\n*Fan Mei-sheng \u2013 Black Bear\n*[[Hoi Sang Lee]] \u2013 Choy\n*Tai Bo \u2013 Mr. B\n*John Cheung \u2013 Bodyguard\n*Chen Ti-ko \u2013 Python\n*Benny Lai \u2013 Pirate No.1\n*Rocky Lai \u2013 Pirate No.2\n*Johnny Cheung \u2013 Pirate No.3\n*Lai Sing-kong \u2013 Pirate No.4\n*Frankie Poon \u2013 Pirate No.5\n*Sun Wong \u2013 Sgt.

[[Ben Lam]], [[Kenny Ho]] and [[Chris Li]] appeared in both films.\n*The scene in Maggie's house is an homage to the scene in the 1935 Marx Brothers film ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'' in which several characters were crammed into a small cabin on a ship. The scene in which the wall falls on Jackie but he escapes injury because he is standing exactly where the window of the wall lands is taken from [[Buster Keaton's]] ''[[Steamboat Bill, Jr.]]''. The handcuff sequence was inspired by a segment Jackie saw on the news magazine ''[[60 Minutes]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n==Box office==\nAt the Hong Kong box office, the film grossed {{HK$}}31,459,916<ref>{{cite web |title=Project A II (1987) |url=http://hkmdb.com/db/movies/view.mhtml?id=6939 |website=[[Hong Kong Movie Database]] |access-date=23 June 2020}}</ref> ({{US$|{{#expr:31459916/7.798 round 0}}|link=yes}}).<ref name=\"worldbank\">{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?end=1987&locations=HK-JP&start=1986 |website=[[World Bank]] |year=1987 |access-date=23 June 2020}}</ref> In Taiwan, it was the fourth highest-grossing film of 1987, earning {{TWD|19,936,980}}<ref>{{cite web |title=1987 Taiwan Box Office |url=http://cinema.nccu.edu.tw/box/3a/3a87.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010219163200/http://cinema.nccu.edu.tw/box/3a/3a87.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 February 2001 |website=[[National Chengchi University]] |year=1987 |language=zh |access-date=30 November 2018}}</ref> (US$697,097).<ref>{{cite web |title=Historical currency converter (TWD) |url=https://fxtop.com/en/historical-currency-converter.php?A=19936980&C1=TWD&C2=USD&DD=31&MM=12&YYYY=1987 |website=fxtop.com |date=31 December 1987 |access-date=23 June 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn Japan, it was the sixth highest-grossing foreign film of 1987,<ref>{{cite web |title=1987\u5e74\uff081\u6708\uff5e12\u6708\uff09 |url=http://www.eiren.org/toukei/1987.html |website=Eiren |publisher=Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan |access-date=20 November 2018}}</ref> earning {{JPY|1.91 billion|link=yes}}<ref>{{cite web |title=\u3010\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u8208\u884c\u6210\u7e3e\u3011 \u7b2c12\u56de\uff1a\u65e5\u672c\u3067\u306e\u8208\u884c\u53ce\u5165 |trans-title=(Jackie Chan Box Office Results) The 12th: Box Office Income in Japan |url=http://kungfutube.info/3672 |website=KungFu Tube |date=2010-09-07 |access-date=23 June 2020 |language=ja}}</ref> ({{US$|{{#expr:1910/144.638 round 1}} million}}).<ref name=\"worldbank\"/> In South Korea, it was the second highest-grossing film of 1984,<ref name=\"korea2\">{{cite web |title=\u3010\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u8208\u884c\u6210\u7e3e\u3011 \u7b2c10\u56de\uff1a\u97d3\u56fd\u3067\u306e\u8208\u884c\u53ce\u5165 |url=http://kungfutube.info/3156 |website=KungFu Tube |date=5 September 2010 |access-date=7 December 2018 |language=ja}}</ref> with 176,273 ticket sales in [[Seoul City]],<ref>{{cite web |title=\uc601\ud654\uc815\ubcf4 |trans-title=Movie Information |url=http://www.kobis.or.kr/kobis/business/mast/mvie/searchMovieList.do |website=KOFIC |publisher=[[Korean Film Council]] |language=ko |access-date=26 August 2019 }}</ref> equivalent to an estimated {{Currency|{{#expr:176273*3500 round -3}}|KRW}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Park |first=Seung Hyun |title=A Cultural Interpretation of Korean Cinema, 1988-1997 |date=2000 |publisher=[[Indiana University]] |page=119 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ilEeAQAAMAAJ |quote=Average Ticket Prices in Korea, 1974-1997 [...] * Source: Korea Cinema Yearbook (1997-1998) * Currency: won [...] Foreign [...] 1987 [...] 3,500}}</ref> ({{US$|{{#expr:616956000/822.568 round 0}}|long=yes}}).<ref>{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) - Korea, Rep. |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?end=1987&locations=KR&start=1986 |website=[[World Bank]] |year=1987 |access-date=7 December 2018}}</ref> This adds up to an estimated total gross of approximately {{US$|{{#expr:4034357+697097+13200000+750036}}|link=no}} in [[East Asia]].\n\nThe film was released in the Philippines by Asia Films Exchange as ''Super Fighter'' on 3 December 1987.<ref>{{cite news|title=Opens Today|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=8cBNEdFwSQkC&dat=19871203&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|access-date=2 May 2019|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Standard Publications, Inc.|date=3 December 1987|page=11}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 71% of seven surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 6.5/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a-gai-waak-juk-jaap-project-a-part-ii/|title=Jackie Chan's Project A2 ('A' gai wak juk jap) (Project A, Part II) (1987)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=2014-07-15}}</ref>  David Beamish of DVDactive rated it 6/10 stars and recommended it to fans of the first film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdactive.com/reviews/dvd/project-a-part-2.html|title=Project A Part 2 (UK - DVD R2)|last=Beamish|first=David|work=DVDactive.com|access-date=2014-07-15}}</ref>  J.
