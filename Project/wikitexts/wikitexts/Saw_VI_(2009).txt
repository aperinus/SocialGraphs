It is the sixth installment in the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' film series]]. The film stars [[Tobin Bell]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Betsy Russell]], [[Mark Rolston]], [[Peter Outerbridge]], and [[Shawnee Smith]]. Similar to its [[Saw V|predecessor]], ''Saw VI'' maintains the focus on the posthumous effects of the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]] and the progression of his successor, Detective [[Mark Hoffman]]. The plot follows an insurance executive who must complete a series of deadly \"games\" set up by Hoffman in order to rescue his employees. Meanwhile, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] comes to suspect that Agent Peter Strahm, who was framed by Hoffman as being Jigsaw's successor, was not actually Jigsaw's accomplice and re-opens the investigation, drawing Hoffman into motion to protect his secret identity.\n\nGreutert served as editor for all the previous ''Saw'' films before making his directorial debut with ''Saw VI''. Melton and Dunstan, the writers for both ''[[Saw IV]]'' and ''[[Saw V]]'', returned to write the screenplay and [[Charlie Clouser]], who provided the score for all previous ''Saw'' films, composed the [[Saw VI: Original Motion Picture Score|score]]. Filming took place in [[Toronto]] from March to May 2009 with a budget of $11 million.\n\nThe film was released by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] in the United States on October 23, 2009. In Spain, it was the first film to receive a [[Motion picture content rating system#Spain|Pel\u00edcula X]] rating for violence (a rating usually reserved for [[pornographic film]]s); the rating restricted screenings to eight select theaters in that country. It was released almost a year later on October 8, 2010, in Spain with an \"18\" rating, after the producers had the offensive content edited out, according to the rating board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2010/08/04/spain_drops_xrating_on_saw_vi|title=Spain Drops X-Rating On 'Saw VI'|date=August 4, 2010|access-date= May 18, 2015}}</ref> With gross receipts of $14 million in its opening weekend, ''Saw VI'' placed second to ''[[Paranormal Activity]]''{{'s}} $21 million. ''Saw VI'' went on to gross over $68 million worldwide, the lowest-grossing ''Saw'' film at the time, but still a financial success compared to its small budget. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with some criticizing the acting and others praising Greutert's directing, but it was generally considered to be an improvement over the last few installments, with the film's contribution to the [[Healthcare reform debate in the United States|debate on healthcare reform in the United States]] also being well received. A sequel, ''[[Saw 3D]]'', was released in 2010.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plots should be between 400 and 700 words -->\n[[Predatory lender]]s [[List of Saw characters#Eddie|Eddie]] and [[List of Saw characters#Simone|Simone]] are locked in head harnesses with screws aimed at their temples, and have one minute to each cut flesh from their bodies and weigh the scale in their favor to survive. Eddie, who is overweight, slices several chunks of fat from his stomach, but is killed after Simone chops off her arm and tips the scale before the timer expires. The game is observed by Detective [[Mark Hoffman]], who has just escaped from the trap that killed [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]]. He then uses Strahm's severed hand to [[False evidence|plant]] his fingerprints at the scene. The police and FBI agent [[List of Saw characters#Dan Erickson|Dan Erickson]] investigate alongside FBI agent [[List of Saw characters#Lindsey Perez|Lindsey Perez]], whose survival was concealed by Erickson for her protection. During Eddie's autopsy, [[List of Saw characters#Adam Heffner|Dr. Adam Heffner]] reveals that the blade used to cut the puzzle piece from his remains is the same blade used years earlier on [[List of Saw characters#Seth Baxter|Seth Baxter]]. Perez and Erickson reopen the investigation, and analyze the videotape found at the scene.\n\nHoffman arrives at [[List of Saw characters#Jill Tuck|Jill Tuck]]'s clinic and demands five envelopes containing photographs of the following game's test subjects from the box left to her in [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]]'s last request. The game involves health insurance executive [[List of Saw characters#William Easton|William Easton]] and his associates, whose company's dubious business policy turned down their clients' coverage for medical treatment, including John. After Hoffman abducts them to an abandoned [[zoo]], William and his janitor [[List of Saw characters#Hank|Hank]], a heavy smoker, are suspended in chains with large metal [[vise]]s that will crush their bodies each time they breathe in their [[oxygen mask]]s. The vise kills Hank, and William proceeds to his other three tests to unlock the remaining bomb shackles from his limbs. The second test at an aquarium forces William to save his elderly secretary [[List of Saw characters#Addy and Allen|Addy]] over his file clerk Allen, who [[Hanging|hangs]] to death from a [[barbed-wire]] noose. At the [[Mechanical room|boiler room]], William unwittingly releases his lawyer [[List of Saw characters#Debbie|Debbie]], who attacks him to retrieve a key inside his body and unlock a [[speargun]] attached to her harness. He fights her off until the device kills her. William's final test involves [[List of Saw characters#Carousel Room Victims|his six subordinates]] chained to a rotating [[Roundabout (play)|roundabout]] where he is only able to save two of them from a mounted shotgun. The game is viewed by mother [[List of Saw characters#Brent and Tara Abbott|Tara]] with her teenage son Brent, and news journalist [[List of Saw characters#Pamela Jenkins|Pamela Jenkins]] from two opposite animal enclosures below the observation room.\n\nDuring the game, Hoffman is called away by Erickson to the audio lab after obtaining the videotape. Erickson, now aware of Strahm's demise, confronts Hoffman after discovering the abnormalities found in Strahm's fingerprints at the time of his death. When Hoffman's voice is unscrambled from the tape, he immediately kills Erickson, Perez, and a technician. Hoffman returns to the observation room and finds the letter he wrote to [[Amanda Young]], who indirectly instigated [[List of Saw characters#Cecil Adams|Cecil Adams]]' robbery at Jill's clinic that resulted in her miscarriage; Hoffman used this knowledge to blackmail Amanda into killing [[List of Saw characters#Lynn Denlon|Dr. Lynn Denlon]]. The letter was found by Pamela and given to Jill, who then uses it to ambush Hoffman. Jill, who had the remaining contents from her box including a sixth envelope containing Hoffman's photo, restrains him and locks a modified reverse bear trap to his head, posthumously fulfilling John's will to test Hoffman after his death.\n\nWilliam reaches the end of his path and enters the cages where he reunites with Pamela, who is his sister. He is confronted by Tara and Brent, the widow and son of [[List of Saw characters#Harold Abbott|Harold Abbott]], a former client who succumbed to his heart disease after William denied his medical request. John's videotape informs Tara to decide William's fate by using the lever in her cell connecting to tanks of [[hydrofluoric acid]] from each cage. As William and Pamela try to persuade the family, an enraged Brent pulls the lever, releasing a platform of needles that kills William by injecting acid into his body. Jill exits the room as Hoffman escapes his wrist restraints. He escapes from the trap just as it activates, sustaining an injury to his right cheek in the process.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw (franchise) cast members|List of Saw characters|label1=List of Saw cast members}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer / Jigsaw]]\n* [[Costas Mandylor]] as [[Mark Hoffman|Detective Mark Hoffman]]\n* [[Mark Rolston]] as Agent Dan Erickson\n* [[Betsy Russell]] as Jill Tuck\n* [[Shawnee Smith]] as [[Amanda Young]]\n* [[Peter Outerbridge]] as William Easton\n* [[Athena Karkanis]] as Agent Lindsey Perez\n* Samantha Lemole as Pamela Jenkins\n* [[Tanedra Howard]] as Simone\n* Marty Moreau as Eddie\n* Shawn Ahmed as Allen\n* Janelle Hutchison as Addy\n* [[Gerry Mendicino]] as Hank\n* [[Caroline Cave]] as Debbie\n* [[George Newbern]] as Harold Abbott\n* [[Shauna MacDonald (Canadian actress)|Shauna MacDonald]] as Tara Abbott\n* [[Devon Bostick]] as Brent Abbott\n* [[Darius McCrary]] as Dave\n* Shawn Mathieson as Josh\n* [[Melanie Scrofano]] as Gena\n* [[Karen Cliche]] as Shelby\n* James Gilbert as Aaron\n* Larissa Gomes as Emily\n* Billy Otis as Cecil Adams\n* James Van Patten as Dr. Adam Heffner\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Sagat]] as Male Addict\n* Karl Campbell as Security Guard\n* Ginger Busch as Sachi\n* [[Mpho Koaho]] as Timothy Young\n}}\nArchival footage of [[Angus Macfadyen]], [[Bahar Soomekh]], and [[Joris Jarsky]], as Jeff Denlon, Lynn Denlon, and Seth Baxter respectively are seen in the film as well.\n\n[[Niamh Wilson]] reprises her role of Corbett Denlon in a [[post-credits scene]] included in the [[director's cut]].\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\nOn {{nowrap|May 14, 2008}}, [[Bloody Disgusting]] reported that [[Kevin Greutert]], the editor of the first five films in the [[Saw (franchise)|franchise]], would make his directorial debut with ''Saw VI''.<ref name=\"Kevin Greutert To Direct Saw VI\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/12258 |title='Saw VI' To Be Directed By Kevin Greutert |work=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |publisher=The Collective |date=May 14, 2008 |access-date=May 20, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210154347/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/12258 |archive-date=December 10, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> Greutert found the process of transitioning from [[film editor|editor]] to [[film director|director]] easy due to his experiences in developing short films and his knowledge about the discussions between the producers and filmmakers.<ref name=\"STYD/Greutert Interview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/interviewsnews.php?id=12404 |title=Exclusive Interview: ''Saw VI'' Director Kevin Greutert |work=[[Mandatory (company)|Mandatory]] |publisher=ShockTillYouDrop.com |date=October 22, 2009 |access-date=November 26, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027002821/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/interviewsnews.php?id=12404 |archive-date=October 27, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> Newcomer to the series, Andrew Coutts replaced him as editor for the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17580 |title='Saw VI' Director Having a 'Mind-Numbingly Complex' Experience |work=Bloody Disgusting |publisher=The Collective |date=June 8, 2009 |access-date=September 4, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404043610/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17580 |archive-date=April 4, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''Saw VI'' marked [[David A.

In his words, Greutert wanted to bring \"a lot of the same insane energy [[Darren Lynn Bousman|Darren Bousman]] brought\" to the series, but making the film feel not only like a horror film but also a [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]], in addition to create the feeling of the audience being in a \"rollecoaster ride which breaks down, it's slow and dark until something jumps out and the audience is back on the rollercoaster\".<ref name=\"STYD/Greutert Interview\" /> He said that the victims in traps would be more one-on-one with the trap and would be more personal to them. This was compared to ''Saw IV'' and ''Saw V'', which most of the traps were set in big rooms and involved several people at one time.<ref name=\"B-D Chats With the Cast and Crew\"/> To conceive the traps, once the storyline was assembled without any specific details for the traps, the writers, Greutert, the producer and the production designer brainstormed ideas for traps in the production office, with some improvised there and others coming from the script.<ref name=\"STYD/Greutert Interview\" />\n\nArmstrong told Bloody Disgusting reviewer Mike Pereira that he thinks \"visually\" ''Saw VI'' might be his favorite, saying \"We're kind of pulling back a little bit in the color palette. It's going to be more suggestive and not so vibrant, in your face like ''III'' and ''IV''. It's more neutral and shows natural flesh tones. On ''Saw V'', I pulled back a little bit and on this one, I pulled back even more.\"<ref name=\"B-D Chats With the Cast and Crew\"/> He commented that the \"steam room\" trap was the \"best looking\" of them all.  He went on to say, \"It's big and expensive. It's got furnaces, fires and steam. It's multi-leveled. The most complex ''Saw''. We had techno cranes flying through. It was pretty amazing.\"<ref name=\"B-D Chats With the Cast and Crew\"/> Commenting on the \"carousel room\" trap Armstrong said: \"It's very carnival, playground-like. It's just nasty. [There are] spinning red lights in there. It's really overwhelming to walk in and look at because everything is spinning.\" Greutert said in an issue of the horror magazine ''[[Fangoria]]'' that the \"carousel room\" was, to date, the \"longest trap scene ever\". He admitted that originally they had ten actors riding the carousel, but it was ultimately scaled down to six, to \"tie in to the [film's] title\".<ref>{{harv|Alexander|2009|p=41}}</ref> [[Post-production]] services were provided by [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lionsgatepublicity.com/epk/saw6/docs/pro_notes.doc|title=Saw VI Production Notes|publisher=[[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]]|format=[[DOC (computing)|.DOC]] file 3.23MB download|access-date=September 18, 2011|archive-date=April 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425051840/http://lionsgatepublicity.com/epk/saw6/docs/pro_notes.doc|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{See also|Saw VI: Original Motion Picture Score}}\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Saw VI: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = various artists\n| cover      =\n|caption     =\n| alt        =\n| released   = October 20, 2009\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]], [[metalcore]]\n| length     = 75:38\n| label      = [[Trustkill Records|Trustkill]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title = [[Saw V Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]\n| prev_year  = 2008\n| next_title = [[Saw 3D#Music|Saw 3D Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]\n| next_year  = 2010\n}}\n''Saw VI: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack'' includes music by the bands [[Every Time I Die]], [[Chimaira]], [[Suicide Silence]], [[Nitzer Ebb]], [[Mushroomhead]], and [[Lacuna Coil]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=48267 |title=Saw VI Soundtrack Final Lineup and Tracklisting Revealed |publisher=Metalundergrounds.com |date=September 14, 2009 |access-date=September 15, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606111156/http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=48267 |archive-date=June 6, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> The soundtrack includes 18 tracks separated by three parts, each with six songs and includes three bonus tracks.
