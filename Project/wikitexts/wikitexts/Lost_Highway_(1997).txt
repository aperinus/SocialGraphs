It stars [[Bill Pullman]], [[Patricia Arquette]], [[Balthazar Getty]], and [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]]. The film follows a musician (Pullman) who begins receiving mysterious messages and [[VHS]] tapes of him and his wife (Arquette) in their home. He is suddenly convicted of murder, after which he inexplicably disappears and is replaced by a young mechanic (Getty) leading a different life.\n\n''Lost Highway'' was financed by the French production company [[Ciby 2000]] and was largely shot in [[Los Angeles]], where Lynch collaborated with frequent producer [[Mary Sweeney]] and cinematographer [[Peter Deming]]. The film's surreal [[narrative structure]] has been likened to a [[M\u00f6bius strip]], while Lynch has described it as a \"[[fugue state|psychogenic fugue]]\" rather than a conventionally logical story. The [[Lost Highway (soundtrack)|film's soundtrack]], which was produced by [[Trent Reznor]], features an original score by [[Angelo Badalamenti]] and [[Barry Adamson]], as well as contributions from artists including [[David Bowie]], [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], [[Rammstein]], [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[The Smashing Pumpkins]].\n\nUpon release, ''Lost Highway'' received mixed reviews and grossed $3.7 million in North America after a modest three-week run. Most critics initially dismissed the film as incoherent, but it has since attracted a [[cult following]] and critical praise, as well as scholarly interest. ''Lost Highway'' is the first of three Lynch films set in Los Angeles, followed by ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' in 2001 and ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' in 2006. In 2003, the film was adapted as an [[Lost Highway (opera)|opera]] by the Austrian composer [[Olga Neuwirth]].\n\n==Plot==\nFred Madison, a [[Los Angeles]] saxophonist, receives a message on his house intercom: \"Dick Laurent is dead.\" The next morning, his wife Renee finds a [[VHS]] tape on their porch containing a video of their house. After having sex, Fred tells her he had a dream about someone resembling her being attacked. He then sees Renee's face as that of a pale old man. Another tape arrives, showing shots of them asleep in their bed. Fred and Renee call the police but the detectives offer no assistance. Fred and Renee attend a party being thrown by her friend Andy. The Mystery Man that Fred dreamed about approaches Fred, claiming to have met him before. The man then says he is at Fred's house at that very moment and answers the house phone when Fred calls him. Fred learns from Andy that the man is a friend of Dick Laurent. Terrified, Fred leaves the party with Renee. The next morning, another tape arrives and Fred watches it alone. To his horror, it shows him hovering over Renee's dismembered body. He is sentenced to death for her murder.\n\nWhile on death row, Fred is plagued by headaches and visions of the Mystery Man and a burning cabin in the desert. During a cell check, the prison guard finds that the man in Fred's cell is now Pete Dayton, a young auto mechanic. Although Pete is released into the care of his parents, he is followed by two detectives who are trying to find out more about him. The next day, Pete returns to work at the garage where gangster Mr. Eddy asks him to fix his car. Mr. Eddy takes Pete for a drive, during which Pete witnesses Mr. Eddy beat down a [[tailgater]]. The next day, Mr. Eddy returns to the garage with his mistress, Alice Wakefield, and his [[Cadillac]] for Pete to repair. Later, Alice returns to the garage alone and invites Pete out for dinner. When Pete and Alice begin an affair, she fears that Mr. Eddy suspects them, and concocts a scheme to rob her friend Andy and leave town. Alice also reveals to Pete that Mr. Eddy is actually an amateur porn producer named Dick Laurent. Pete gets a phone call from Mr. Eddy and the Mystery Man, which frightens Pete so much that he decides to go along with Alice's plan. Pete ambushes Andy and accidentally kills him, before he notices a photograph showing Alice and Renee together. Later, when the police are at the house investigating Andy's death, Alice is inexplicably missing from the photo.\n\nPete and Alice arrive at an empty cabin in the desert and start having sex outside on the sand. Alice taunts Pete and walks into the cabin as Pete turns back into Fred. Fred searches the cabin and finds only the Mystery Man, who tells him that there is no Alice, only Renee, and starts chasing him with a video camera. Fred escapes and drives to the Lost Highway Hotel, where he finds Mr. Eddy and Renee having sex. After Renee leaves, Fred kidnaps Mr. Eddy and slits his throat. The Mystery Man shoots Mr. Eddy dead and then whispers something to Fred before he disappears. Fred drives to his old house, buzzes the intercom and says, \"Dick Laurent is dead.\" When the two detectives drive up to the house, Fred runs back to his car and drives off with the detectives in pursuit. He leads the police on a high-speed chase through the desert, begins screaming helplessly amid flashes of light, and then falls silent as headlights trace the darkened highway.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Fred Madison\n* [[Patricia Arquette]] as Renee Madison/Alice Wakefield\n* [[Balthazar Getty]] as Pete Dayton\n* [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] as The Mystery Man\n* [[Robert Loggia]] as Mr. Eddy/Dick Laurent\n* [[Natasha Gregson Wagner]] as Sheila\n* [[Richard Pryor]] as Arnie\n* [[Lisa Boyle]] as Marian\n* [[Mink Stole]] as Forewoman \n* [[Michael Massee]] as Andy\n* [[Jack Nance]] as Phil\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Jack Kehler]] as Guard Johnny Mack\n* [[Henry Rollins]] as Guard Henry\n* Gene Ross as Warden Clements\n* [[Giovanni Ribisi]] as Steve 'V'\n* [[Scott Coffey]] as Teddy\n* [[Gary Busey]] as Bill Dayton\n* [[John Roselius]] as Al\n* [[Lou Eppolito]] as Ed\n* [[Jennifer Syme]] as Junkie Girl\n* [[Marilyn Manson]] as Porn actor\n* [[Twiggy Ramirez]] as Porn actor\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Barry Gifford.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Author [[Barry Gifford]] co-wrote the screenplay with Lynch.]]\n''Lost Highway'' was directed by [[David Lynch]] as his first feature film since ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'' (1992), a prequel to his television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' (1990-1991).<ref name=\"Lynch and Reznor\"/> He came across the phrase \"lost highway\" in the book ''Night People'' (1992) by [[Barry Gifford]].<ref name=\"Regain the Peak\"/> Because Lynch knew the writer very well and had previously adapted his novel ''[[Wild at Heart (novel)|Wild at Heart]]'' (1990) into [[Wild at Heart (film)|a film by the same name]],<ref name=\"Cinefantastique article\"/> he told him that he loved the phrase as a title for a movie. The two agreed to write a [[screenplay]] together,<ref name=\"Positif interview\"/> having their own different ideas of what ''Lost Highway'' should be. They ended up rejecting all of them.<ref name=\"Positif interview\"/> Lynch then told Gifford that, during the last night of shooting ''Fire Walk with Me'', he had a thought about videotapes and a couple in crisis.<ref name=\"Positif interview\"/> This idea would develop into the first part of the film until Fred Madison is put on death row. Lynch and Gifford then realized that a transformation had to occur and another story, which would have several links to the first one but also differ, developed.<ref name=\"Positif interview\"/> It took them one month to finish the script.<ref name=\"Positif interview\"/>\n\n''Lost Highway'' was partially inspired by the [[O. J. Simpson murder case]] and Simpson's ability to lead his life afterward.<ref name=\"AV Club cult\"/> The film's opening scene, where Fred Madison hears the words \"Dick Laurent is dead\" over his intercom, was inspired by an analogous incident that happened to Lynch at his own house.<ref name=\"Positif interview\"/> Because his house was next to actor [[David Lander]]'s house and both men have the same first name, Lynch thought the stranger must have been wrong about the address.<ref name=\"Positif interview\"/> The idea of The Mystery Man \"came out of a feeling of a man who, whether real or not, gave the impression that he was supernatural\", Lynch explained.<ref name=\"Cinefantastique article\"/> The film was financed by the French production company [[Ciby 2000]].<ref name=\"Premiere article\"/> Lynch's Asymmetrical Productions, whose offices are near his house in the [[Hollywood Hills]], was also involved in the film's production.<ref name=\"Premiere article\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nLynch cast [[Bill Pullman]], a friend and neighbor of his, as the film's central character.<ref name=\"Toronto Sun\"/> Actress [[Patricia Arquette]] agreed to be cast as Renee and Alice because she was interested in portraying a sexually desirable and dangerous woman,<ref name=\"W interview\"/> a role she had never done before.<ref name=\"Baker scene\"/> She had also been a fan of Lynch for a long time and felt that it would be an honor to work with him.<ref name=\"W interview\"/><ref name=\"Baker scene\"/> Actor [[Balthazar Getty]] was chosen for the role of Pete Dayton after Lynch saw a picture of him in a magazine and said that he was \"the guy for the job\".<ref name=\"Room to Dream\"/> Because the script was so open to interpretation, Getty and Arquette did not know what kind of film ''Lost Highway'' was supposed to be. According to Getty, \"Part of David's technique is to keep his actors guessing, because it creates a certain atmosphere on set.\"<ref name=\"Room to Dream\"/>\n\nActor [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] was cast as The Mystery Man because Lynch liked his previous work and was always interested in working with him.<ref name=\"Cinefantastique article\"/> Although Blake did not understand the script at all, he was responsible for the look and style of his character. When Lynch told him to use his imagination, Blake decided to cut his hair short, part it in the middle, and apply white [[Kabuki]] make-up on his face. He then put on a black outfit and approached Lynch, who loved what he had done.<ref name=\"Cinefantastique article\"/> Actor [[Robert Loggia]], who had previously expressed interest in playing the role of [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]] in Lynch's 1986 mystery film ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'', was cast as Mr. Eddy and Dick Laurent. Lynch recalled that, upon learning of [[Dennis Hopper]]'s casting as Booth, Loggia launched a profanity-laden rant at him, which would eventually become Mr. Eddy's road rage scene.<ref name=\"Guardian Loggia\"/> ''Lost Highway'' also features the final motion picture performance of [[Richard Pryor]].<ref name=\"AV Club cult\"/>\n\n===Filming and editing===\n[[File:David lynch.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Lynch originally intended to shoot ''Lost Highway'' in [[black and white]].]]\n''Lost Highway'' was shot in Los Angeles, California, in about 54 days,<ref name=\"Sight Sound article\"/> from November 29, 1995, to February 22, 1996.<ref name=\"Premiere article\"/> Some of the film's exterior and driving scenes were shot in [[Griffith Park]],<ref name=\"Premiere article\"/> while the scenes of the Lost Highway Hotel were filmed at the [[Amargosa Opera House and Hotel]] in [[Death Valley]].<ref name=\"Lost Highway Hotel\"/> Lynch owns the property that was used for Fred and Renee's mansion, which is located on the same street as his own house in the Hollywood Hills.<ref name=\"Lynch and Reznor\"/> The house was configured in a particular way to meet the requirements of the film. A corridor that leads to the bedroom was added and the fa\u00e7ade was remodeled with slot windows to make Fred's point of view very limited.<ref name=\"Positif interview\"/> The paintings that are on the wall above the couch were done by Lynch's ex-wife and producer [[Mary Sweeney]].<ref name=\"Premiere article\"/>\n\nThe scenes that involved nudity and sexual contact proved to be very difficult for Arquette because she considers herself a very modest and shy person. Nevertheless, she felt very protected by Lynch and the film crew, who would always give her robes at any time.<ref name=\"W interview\"/> The love scene between her and Getty in the desert, which was shot on a dry lake bed 20 miles outside [[Baker, California|Baker]],<ref name=\"Baker scene\"/> was a closed set and only key crew were allowed on it.<ref name=\"W interview\"/> The sequence where Fred transforms into Pete was not [[Computer graphics|computer-generated]], but rather accomplished with in-camera techniques: a makeup expert constructed a fake head that was covered with artificial brain matter, which was then intercut with shots of Pullman.<ref name=\"Cinematographer article\"/> The final car chase was shot with two different cameras running at different [[frame rate]]s. The footage was then sped up to make the scene more aggressive.<ref name=\"Cinematographer article\"/>\n\nLynch worked with cinematographer [[Peter Deming]] to give the film a [[Surrealism|surreal]] look.<ref name=\"Cinefantastique article\"/> Because the script did not include many descriptions, the film's visual approach evolved as filming progressed.<ref name=\"Positif interview\"/> Deming would occasionally pull out the lenses of his camera to defocus a particular scene,<ref name=\"Filmmaker interview\"/> while Lynch would often listen to music in his headset and to a scene at the same time to visualize the screenplay.<ref name=\"W interview\"/> According to him, \"Sound and picture working together is what films are [...] So every single sound has to be supporting that scene and enlarging it. A room is, say, nine by twelve, but when you're introducing sound to it, you can create a space that's giant\".<ref name=\"Cinefantastique article\"/> The notion of a [[psychogenic fugue]] was incorporated into the film after the unit publicist read it up on a book about [[mental illness]]es. Lynch felt it was a musical term, stating that \"a fugue starts off one way, takes up on another direction, and then comes back to the original, so it [relates] to the form of the film.\"<ref name=\"Filmmaker interview\"/>\n\nOriginally, Lynch wanted to shoot ''Lost Highway'' in [[black and white]], but the idea was discarded due to the financial risks it could cause. Nevertheless, the film was shot in varying levels of darkness and features few daylight scenes.<ref name=\"Cinefantastique article\"/> Some sequences became so dark that it was difficult for viewers to see what was happening. According to Deming, \"The thing I wanted to achieve was giving the feeling that anything could come out of the background, and to leave a certain question about what you're looking at. The film is working under the surface while you're watching it.\"<ref name=\"Cinefantastique article\"/> The film's darkness was intentionally not adjusted during post-production.<ref name=\"Cinefantastique article\"/> The first cut of the film ran two and a half hours, and a [[test audience]] of 50 people was given a preview to give Lynch an idea of what needed to be cut.<ref name=\"Cinefantastique article\"/> The film was ultimately cut down to two hours and ten minutes. Most of the deleted scenes were about Pete's life, including a scene where Pete would go out with his friends to a [[drive-in]] before going to the [[bowling]] alley.<ref name=\"Cinefantastique article\"/>\n\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Main|Lost Highway (soundtrack)}}\nThe film's original score was composed by [[Angelo Badalamenti]] with additional music by [[Barry Adamson]].<ref name=\"CoS soundtrack\"/> Badalamenti had previously worked with Lynch on ''Blue Velvet'' and ''Twin Peaks''.<ref name=\"Cinefantastique article\"/> Although most of the score was recorded in [[Prague]], additional compositions were done in [[London]].<ref name=\"Cinefantastique article\"/> In [[New Orleans]], Lynch collaborated with musician [[Trent Reznor]] of [[Nine Inch Nails]] to provide additional music. Together, they created music that accompanied the scenes in which Fred and Renee watch the mysterious VHS tapes.<ref name=\"Reznor interview\"/> Two songs by Reznor and Nine Inch Nails, \"[[The Perfect Drug]]\" and \"Driver Down\", were specifically composed for the film.<ref name=\"CoS soundtrack\"/> Reznor then produced a [[soundtrack]] album that includes the film's score and songs by artists such as [[David Bowie]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], and [[Rammstein]].<ref name=\"AV Club soundtrack\"/>\n\nMarilyn Manson's contributions include their cover of [[Screamin' Jay Hawkins]]' \"[[I Put a Spell on You]]\", which was previously released on their 1995 EP ''[[Smells Like Children]]'', and \"[[Apple of Sodom (song)|Apple of Sodom]]\", which was specifically written for the film.<ref name=\"AV Club soundtrack\"/> The Smashing Pumpkins' frontman [[Billy Corgan]] wrote \"[[Eye (song)|Eye]]\" after Lynch rejected an early version of \"Tear\" from the band's 1998 album ''[[Adore (The Smashing Pumpkins album)|Adore]]''.<ref name=\"AV Club soundtrack\"/> Two songs by Rammstein\u2014\"[[Rammstein (song)|Rammstein]]\" and \"Heirate Mich\"\u2014were included after Lynch listened to their 1995 debut album ''[[Herzeleid]]'' while exploring locations for the film.<ref name=\"AV Club soundtrack\"/> The track \"Insensatez\", an instrumental version of the [[bossa nova]] song \"[[How Insensitive]]\" by [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim]], was also included as part of the film's soundtrack.<ref name=\"AV Club soundtrack\"/> The album, which was released on November 26, 1996,<ref name=\"MTV soundtrack\"/> reached No. 7 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and was certified [[Recording Industry Association of America|Gold]] status in the US.<ref name=\"AV Club soundtrack\"/>\n\n==Themes==\nAlthough ''Lost Highway'' is generally classified as a [[neo-noir]] film,<ref name=\"FilmNoir\"/><ref name=\"Popmatters noir\"/><ref name=\"20th anniversary\"/> the film borrows elements from other genres, including [[German Expressionism]] and [[French New Wave]].<ref name=\"Cinefantastique article\"/> The terms [[psychological thriller]] and [[horror film]] have also been used to describe its narrative elements.<ref name=\"The Five Best Films\"/><ref name=\"Metroactive\"/><ref name=\"Lost Highway at 20\"/> Writing for the Australian ''Metro Magazine'', Thomas Caldwell described Fred Madison as \"a typical [[film noir]] hero, inhabiting a doomed and desolate world characterised by an excess of sexuality, darkness and violence.\"<ref name=\"Lost in Darkness\"/> Another film noir feature that is present in the film is the [[femme fatale]] (Alice Wakefield), who misleads Pete Dayton into dangerous situations.<ref name=\"Variety review\"/> The film was also noted for its graphic violence and sexual themes. Lynch defended these images, stating that he was simply being honest with his own ideas for the film.<ref name=\"Lynch and Reznor\"/>\n\nSome of the film's themes and ideas had been explored before: the 1945 film ''[[Detour (1945 film)|Detour]]'' also focuses on a disturbed male nightclub musician.<ref name=\"20th anniversary\"/> The film's setting and mysterious recorded messages were seen as a reference to the 1955 film ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'', while its nightmarish atmosphere has been compared to [[Maya Deren]]'s 1943 short film ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]]''.<ref name=\"20th anniversary\"/> Like [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1958 film ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', the film examines male obsessions with women, who merely represent emotions that relate to them.<ref name=\"20th anniversary\"/> Lynch has described the film as a \"psychogenic fugue\"<ref name=\"Slate DVD\"/> and insisted that, while ''Lost Highway'' is about \"identity\",<ref name=\"Cinefantastique article\"/> the film is very abstract and can be interpreted in different ways.<ref name=\"Positif interview\"/> He does not favor advancing a specific interpretation and said that the film leaves viewers to interpret events as they choose.<ref name=\"Cinefantastique article\"/> Gifford, however, thinks that the film offers a rational explanation to its surreal events. According to him, Fred Madison is experiencing a psychogenic fugue, which is manifested when he transforms into Pete.<ref name=\"Cinefantastique article\"/> Some viewers think that the film is a homage to [[Ambrose Bierce]]'s 1890 short story \"[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]\".<ref name=\"Lynch Dilemma\"/>\n\nThe film's circular narrative has been likened to a [[M\u00f6bius strip]].<ref name=\"Slate DVD\"/><ref name=\"AV Club cult\"/> Cultural critic [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] felt that this circularity is analogous to a [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] process. According to him, \"there is a symptomatic key phrase (as in all of Lynch's films) that always returns as an insistent, traumatic, and indecipherable message ([[the Real]]), and there is a temporal loop, as with analysis, where the protagonist at first fails to encounter the self, but in the end is able to pronounce the [[symptom]] consciously as his own.\"<ref name=\"Slavoj Zizek\"/> This implies that Fred's madness is so powerful that even the fantasy where he sees himself as Pete ultimately dissolves and ends in a nightmare.<ref name=\"Slavoj Zizek\"/> He also interprets the film's bipartite structure as exploiting \"the opposition of two horrors: the phantasmatic horror of the nightmarish noir universe of perverse sex, betrayal, and murder, and the (perhaps much more unsettling) despair of our drab, alienated daily life of impotence and distrust.\"<ref name=\"Emma Wilson\"/>\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n[[File:Sundance Film Festival.jpg|right|thumb|''Lost Highway'' [[premiere]]d at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].]]\n''Lost Highway'' was released in France on January 15, 1997.<ref name=\"Bifi\" /> In North America, the film [[premiere]]d at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in [[Park City, Utah]], in January 1997.<ref name=\"Sundance Film Festival\"/> The film was then given a [[limited release]] on February 21, 1997 in 12 theaters, grossing nearly $213,000 at the US box office weekend.<ref name=\"Box Office Mojo\"/> The film [[Wide release|expanded]] a week later in 212 theaters and, after a modest three-week run, it went on to make $3.7 million in North America.<ref name=\"Box Office Mojo\"/> On May 19, 2017, ''Lost Highway'' was released in Russia and grossed $28,347.<ref name=\"The Numbers\"/> Overall, the film grossed nearly $3.8 million worldwide.<ref name=\"The Numbers\"/>\n\n===Critical reception===\nUpon release, ''Lost Highway'' received mixed reviews from critics.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/> Both [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film \"two thumbs down\", a rating Lynch would later tout as \"two more great reasons to see\" ''Lost Highway''.<ref name=\"DV review\"/> Ebert argued that, while Lynch effectively puts images on the screen and uses a strong soundtrack to create mood, the film does not make sense, concluding that ''Lost Highway'' \"is about design, not cinema\".<ref name=\"Ebert review\"/> Similarly, [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that ''Lost Highway'' is a \"beautifully made but emotionally empty\" film that \"exists only for the sensation of its provocative moments\".<ref name=\"LAT review\"/> Both [[Stephanie Zacharek]] of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' and [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' felt that the film was very superficial, especially when compared to ''Blue Velvet''.<ref name=\"Salon review\"/><ref name=\"EW review\"/> Zacharek said that Lynch \"traded some of his disturbing originality for noir formula and schticky weirdness\",<ref name=\"Salon review\"/> while Gleiberman compared the film's sex scenes to those of \"mediocre Hollywood thrillers\".<ref name=\"EW review\"/>\n\nIn a more positive review, ''[[The New York Times]]'' journalist [[Janet Maslin]] felt that, while the film's perversity is unoriginal and resembles that of ''Blue Velvet'', ''Lost Highway'' still \"holds sinister interest of its own\" and \"invites its audience to ponder\".<ref name=\"NYT review\"/> ''[[Metro Silicon Valley|Metro]]'' editor [[Richard von Busack]] praised ''Lost Highway'' as a \"true horror\" film due to its confusing and unpleasant screenplay.<ref name=\"Metroactive\"/> He explained that horror \"ought to transcend logic and ordinary reality\" and, unlike with popular horror films like ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996), where the difference between screen violence and real violence is obvious, Lynch \"present[s] horror as horror, willing to baffle us, willing to wound us\".<ref name=\"Metroactive\"/> In another positive review, Andy Klein of the ''[[Dallas Observer]]'' felt that ''Lost Highway'' was a return to form for Lynch and considered it his best work since ''Blue Velvet''.<ref name=\"DO review\"/> Klein compared the film's unanswerable concerns to the \"Star Gate\" sequence from ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), stating that ''Lost Highway'' is \"better absorbed and experienced than analyzed\".<ref name=\"DO review\"/>\n\nWriting for the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', critic [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] felt that ''Lost Highway'' was \"an audacious move away from conventional narrative and back toward the formal beauty of ''[[Eraserhead]]''\".<ref name=\"CR review\"/> He credited Lynch's \"masterful and often powerful fusions of sound and image\" for giving the film a very [[Expressionism|expressionist]] style.<ref name=\"CR review\"/> However, he criticized the noir [[iconography]] for its lack of historical context. For example, he explained that, while Arquette's clothes fit in a noir setting, The Mystery Man's video camera is very contemporary and feels out of place.<ref name=\"CR review\"/> [[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' concluded that, although ''Lost Highway'' is \"uneven and too deliberately obscure in meaning to be entirely satisfying\", the result \"remains sufficiently intriguing and startling to bring many of Lynch's old fans back on board\".<ref name=\"Variety review\"/>\n\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\nAt the 1997 [[Stinkers Bad Movie Awards]], ''Lost Highway'' was nominated for Worst Picture and Worst Director, but lost to ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' in both categories.<ref name=\"Stinkers Awards\"/> At the 1998 [[Belgian Film Critics Association]], the film was nominated for the [[Grand Prix (Belgian Film Critics Association)|Grand Prix]] award, but lost to ''[[Lone Star (1996 film)|Lone Star]]''.<ref name=\"Grand Prix nom\"/>\n\n===Home media===\n''Lost Highway'' was released on [[DVD]] on March 25, 2008, by [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]]. The DVD is presented in [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]] [[widescreen]] in the 2.35:1 ratio with [[Dolby Digital]] 5.1 audio.<ref name=\"Slant DVD\"/> The film was then released on [[Blu-ray]] format in France in 2010, and in Japan and the United Kingdom in 2012.<ref name=\"Blu-ray JP\"/><ref name=\"Blu-ray UK\"/> The British edition includes a collection of short, experimental films that Lynch had previously sold on his website.
