The film received mixed reviews from critics, but Bynes' performance was praised.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Viola (Twelfth Night)|Viola Hastings]] is a teen girl who plays for Cornwall's soccer team until the team gets cut. Her dream is to play for the [[North Carolina Tar Heels]]. Meanwhile, her twin brother, [[Sebastian (Twelfth Night)|Sebastian]] is supposed to enroll in Illyria, an elite boarding school, but he secretly goes to [[London]] with his fledgling band instead. Viola agrees to cover for him and decides to pass herself off as Sebastian, in hopes of joining their boys' team and beating Cornwall to prove their coach and her cocky ex-boyfriend, Justin, wrong for suggesting cancellation of the ladies' soccer team. With the help of her stylist friend, Paul, she is transformed into \"Sebastian\" and attends Illyria in his place.\n\nWhile moving in, she meets her roommate, [[Duke Orsino]], an attractive soccer player and Illyria's team captain. During tryouts, Viola fails to impress Coach Dinklage and is assigned to second string, much to her dismay. Her teammates, including Duke, initially dislike \"Sebastian\" due to his awkward and strange behavior. However, with help from Paul once again, they begin to accept him into their social circle. \"Sebastian\" then gets the popular and beautiful [[Olivia (Twelfth Night)|Olivia Lennox]] as his lab partner, which frustrates Duke, as he has feelings for her. \"Sebastian\" agrees to put in a good word for Duke if he promises to train him to be a better soccer player. Coach Dinklage eventually notices \"Sebastian's\" effort and improvement, thus promoting him to first string.\n\nAt the Junior League carnival, where her mother has made her volunteer, Viola works a shift at the kissing booth and kisses Duke. Duke expresses to \"Sebastian\" that he might move on from Olivia as he is starting to like Viola now. Viola is delighted as she secretly feels the same way.\n\nOlivia who now has a crush on \"Sebastian\", asks Duke out on a date in hopes that it will make \"Sebastian\" jealous. Viola, who is unaware of Olivia's true intentions, is enraged instead because Duke has now abandoned his interest in Viola. When Viola finds out the truth, she encourages Olivia to tell \"Sebastian\" directly about her feelings.\n\nThe situation becomes even more complicated when the real Sebastian returns from London a day early, unbeknownst to Viola. As soon as he arrives at Illyria, Olivia confesses her feelings and kisses him. Duke, seeing this, believes his roommate has betrayed him. When \"Sebastian\" returns to their room, the two have an argument and Duke kicks him out. Viola oversleeps and misses the first half of the game, while the real Sebastian is mistaken for \"Sebastian\" and winds up poorly playing his sister's game instead. At [[half-time]], Viola explains the situation to Sebastian and they switch places again.\n\nDuke, still furious at \"Sebastian\", refuses to cooperate with him on the field. Determined to makes amends with Duke, \"Sebastian\" explains that he is actually Viola. Illyria wins the game when Viola scores a goal, finally humiliating Justin and the rest of the Cornwall boys.\n\nEveryone at Illyria celebrates their victory over Cornwall, except for Duke who is hurt about Viola's deception. Viola introduces Sebastian and Olivia officially, and they begin dating. Viola and Sebastian's divorced parents also make up, exchanging contact information so as to be better parents towards their children. She invites Duke to her [[debutante]] ball, with an invitation delivered by Sebastian, now Duke's actual roommate. Still hurt, Duke doesn't respond to Viola's invitation, which devastates her. At the ball, Viola is skeptical that Duke will show up; she distracts herself by assisting Olivia, who is being escorted by Sebastian to the ball, and is touched when Paul asks to be her date. Her mother shows up with a dress that will suit Viola's \"no ruffles\" policy, but Viola decides to go for a walk instead. She runs into Duke outside, who tells her that he has feelings for her, but that he doesn't want there to be any more deception on her part; Viola promises to be honest with him. Later, Monique is escorted by Justin, Olivia is escorted by Sebastian, and Viola and Duke enter the stage late, but together, with Viola in her new dress, much to the joy of her mother. Viola and Duke share a kiss before joining the crowd. At the end of the film, Viola and Duke are shown happily playing on Illyria's soccer team together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Amanda Bynes]] as [[Viola (Twelfth Night)|Viola Hastings]], a talented soccer player underestimated for being a girl, who dresses up as her twin brother Sebastian to play soccer at Illyria\n* [[Channing Tatum]] as [[Orsino (Twelfth Night)|Duke Orsino]], the soccer team captain, who is in love with Olivia and, later, with Viola\n* [[Laura Ramsey]] as [[Olivia (Twelfth Night)|Olivia Lennox]], a smart girl who falls in love with Sebastian (Viola)\n* [[James Snyder (actor)|James Snyder]] as Malcolm Festes, the school nerd and Sebastian's (Viola's) rival\n* [[Emily Perkins]] as Eunice Bates, the nerdy and eccentric classmate with weird sexual fantasies\n* [[Alexandra Breckenridge|Alex Breckenridge]] as Monique Valentine, Sebastian's superficial girlfriend\n* James Kirk as [[Sebastian (Twelfth Night)|Sebastian Hastings]], Viola's twin brother, who is in Europe with his band.\n* [[Robert Hoffman (actor)|Robert Hoffman]] as Justin Drayton, Viola's ex-boyfriend and Duke's rival\n* [[Vinnie Jones]] as Coach Dinklage\n* [[David Cross]] as Principal Horatio Gold\n* [[Julie Hagerty]] as Daphne Hastings, the mother of Viola and Sebastian\n* [[John Pyper-Ferguson]] as Roger Hastings, the father of Viola and Sebastian\n* [[Brandon Jay McLaren]] as Toby, one of Duke's best friends, who is attracted to Eunice\n* Clifton Murray as Andrew, one of Duke's best friends\n* [[Jonathan Sadowski]] as Paul Antonio, Viola's best friend and hair stylist\n* [[Amanda Crew]] as Kia, one of Viola's friends\n* [[Jessica Lucas]] as Yvonne, one of Viola's friends\n* [[Lynda Boyd]] as Cheryl, the debutante ball's hostess\n* [[Katie Stuart]] as Maria, Olivia's friend\n* [[Robert Torti]] as Coach Pistonek\n* [[Mark Acheson]] as Groundskeeper\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Channing Tatum TIFF, 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Channing Tatum]] was cast in the film at the insistence of Bynes, who felt that he would be perfect in the role.]]\nAn adaptation of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', the film was directed by [[Andy Fickman]], produced by [[Lauren Shuler Donner]], [[Tom Rosenberg]], and [[Gary Lucchesi]], and was written by [[Karen McCullah Lutz]] and [[Kirsten Smith (writer)|Kirsten Smith]].\n\n[[Amanda Bynes]] and [[Channing Tatum]] were cast respectively in the lead roles of [[Viola (Twelfth Night)|Viola Hastings]] and [[Orsino (Twelfth Night)|Duke Orsino]]; Tatum had been chosen at Bynes' insistence, as she felt that he would be received well by audiences.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|first=Sarah|last=El-Mahmoud|date=November 27, 2018|title=Amanda Bynes Fought For Channing Tatum's She's The Man Role|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2462190/amanda-bynes-fought-for-channing-tatums-shes-the-man-role|access-date=January 9, 2021|website=CINEMABLEND}}</ref> She told [[Paper (magazine)|''Paper'']] in 2018 that \"I totally fought for Channing [to get cast in] that movie because he wasn't famous yet,\" she said. \"He'd just done a [[Mountain Dew]] commercial and I was like, 'This guy's a star\u2014every girl will love him!'
