Rather than attending his high school French class, he spends all of his time drinking and partying, until graduation arrives, when all of his debauchery catches up to him and he learns that he cannot graduate without a French [[Course credit|credit]]. He has only one more chance to obtain the credit: the French teacher, Mrs. Grober ([[Robin Bartlett]]), and the French Club are headed to [[France]] for [[summer school]], and Michael must accompany them and participate if he wants to graduate that year.\n\nHowever, at the airport, a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent ''also'' named Michael Corben ([[David McIlwraith]]), who is on his way to France as well, is killed by the assassin Ilsa Grunt ([[Linda Hunt]]), henchwoman and surrogate mother of the villainous Augustus Steranko ([[Roger Rees]]) who seeks to steal all of the [[gold]] in Europe and use it to mint his own coins under the guise of a [[Economic and monetary union|common currency]]. Because important details about the agent's identity (including his actual age) have been kept meticulously secret, Michael is mistaken for the CIA agent. He is inexplicably boarded [[first class (aviation)|first class]] on his flight to [[Paris]], and upon arrival is whisked away by [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Intelligence]].\n\nThe late Agent Corben's mission had been to protect Augustus Steranko, who (being not suspected to be evil) has been murdering European [[finance minister]]s as part of his plan. After some efforts to explain that he is not the Corben they think he is, Michael agrees to play along once it becomes apparent that he will be allowed to utilize high-tech gadgets, including [[X-ray]] glasses, exploding chewing gum and [[L.A. Gear]] sneakers with suction cups, as well as a [[Lotus Esprit]]. At first, he enjoys the perks of being a spy, but begins to rethink his decision once his life gets endangered by Steranko's deadly assassins, including Zigesfeld ([[Tom Rack]]), a henchman with a prosthetic gold hand, and Areola Canasta ([[Carole Davis]]), who kills her victims using her poisonous pet [[scorpion]].\n\nIn the meantime, Steranko captures Michael's teacher and classmates and holds them all hostage at his remote castle stronghold. Michael teams up with a girl his own age named Mariska ([[Gabrielle Anwar]]), the daughter of Agent Blade ([[Roger Daltrey]]) who was murdered by Steranko and his gang, to bring the villains down and save his friends as well as all of Europe's gold. Despite being briefly captured and imprisoned by Steranko's men, Michael escapes, rescues Mrs. Grober and his friends, and battles and defeats Zigesfeld.\n\nSteranko, his duplicitous nature exposed by Michael, kidnaps Mariska and attempts to escape with his gold in his [[Eurocopter AS355|Eurocopter Ecureuil]] [[helicopter]]. Michael manages to rescue Mariska, and Steranko is subsequently killed when he falls out of the helicopter, and it and the onboard gold supply both drop on him. Afterwards, Mrs. Grober agrees to give Michael the French credit that he needs.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Grieco]] as Michael Corben\n* [[Linda Hunt]] as Ilsa Grunt\n* [[Roger Rees]] as Augustus Steranko, a leader of [[European Economic Community]].\n* [[Robin Bartlett]] as Patricia Grober\n* [[Gabrielle Anwar]] as Mariska Blade\n* [[Geraldine James]] as Vendetta Galante\n* [[Michael Siberry]] as Derek Richardson\n* [[Tom Rack]] as Zigesfeld\n* [[Carole Davis]] as Areola Canasta\n* [[Frederick Coffin]] as Lieutenant Colonel Larabee\n* [[Roger Daltrey]] as Blade\n* Oliver Dear as Kent\n* [[Cynthia Preston]] as Melissa Tyler\n* [[Michael Sinelnikoff]] as Haywood\n* Travis Swords as Kelly\n* [[Gerry Mendicino]] as Herb Corben\n* [[Fiona Reid]] as Marge Corben\n* Michael Vinokur as Brad Corben\n* [[David McIlwraith]] as Agent Michael Corben\n* Gene Mack as Agent Kramer\n* Jacques Tourangeau as Jacques Lefevre\n\n==Production==\nOriginally written by Fred Dekker as an original script, titled ''Teen Agent'', which was to blend  [[Anthony Michael Hall]] from [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]\u2019 films with a [[James Bond]] adventure.<ref name=\"FakeShemp\">{{cite web |url=https://www.fakeshemp.net/interviews/fred-dekker|title=Fred Dekker interview |work=fakeshemp.net}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = If Looks Could Kill\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = March 15, 1991\n| recorded   = 1990\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     =\n| label      = [[MCA Records]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\n#\"If Looks Could Kill (No Turning Back)\" - [[Glenn Medeiros]]\n#\"One Hot Country\" - [[The Outfield]]\n#\"Loud Guitars, Fast Cars and Wild, Wild Livin'\" - [[Contraband (band)|Contraband]]\n#\"One Mo' Time\" - [[Trixter]]\n#\"[[Better the Devil You Know]]\" - [[Kylie Minogue]]\n#\"Teach Me How to Dream\" - [[Robin McAuley]]\n#\"All Is Fair\" - [[The Fixx]]\n#\"Maybe This Time\" - [[The Stabilizers]]\n#\"My Saltine\" - [[Bang Tango]]\n#\"Michael Corben's Adventure\" - [[David Foster]] and [[William Ross (composer)|Bill Ross]]\n\n==Box office and reception==\n''If Looks Could Kill'' opened in 11th place for $2.2 million in the US.<ref>{{cite news|title= THREE-DAY WEEKEND BOX OFFICE : 'Lambs' Is Still Roaring  |work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1991-03-19|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1991-03-19/entertainment/ca-744_1_la-femme-nikita|access-date=2012-06-03|first=Pat H.|last=Broeske}}</ref>  It grossed $7.8 million at the end of its US theatrical run.<ref name=mojo/> [[Roger Ebert]] of ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, saying that he initially thought it a bad film.
