It is set in 1999 against the backdrop of Mexico's political and economic realities, specifically at the end of the uninterrupted [[List of Presidents of Mexico|seven decades of presidents]] from the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] and the rise of the opposition led by [[Vicente Fox]].\n\nThe film's explicit depiction of sex, nudity, and drug use caused complications in the film's rating. However, in Mexico, the film earned $2.2 million its first weekend in June 2001, setting a new record for the highest [[box office]] opening in Mexican cinema.<ref name=\"shaw,2013\" /> In 2002, the film was released in English-speaking markets under its Spanish title, with a limited release in the United States. The film received critical acclaim and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] at the [[Academy Awards]] and as [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[Golden Globe Awards]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film opens with \"two teenage best friends\", working-class Julio and upper-class Tenoch\u2014each having sex with their respective girlfriends before the girls depart on a trip to Italy. Without their girlfriends around, the boys take the opportunity to live as bachelors.\n\nAt a wedding, they meet Luisa, the [[Spain|Spanish]] wife of Tenoch's cousin, Jano. Trying to impress Luisa, the boys talk about a fictitious, secluded beach called Boca del Cielo (\"Heaven's Mouth\"); however, she initially declines their invitation to accompany them there. Later, Luisa visits a doctor; after her appointment, she receives a phone call from a drunken Jano, who tearfully confesses that he cheated on her. The next day, Luisa calls Tenoch and asks if their offer to accompany them to the beach is still open.\n\nAlthough Julio and Tenoch have little idea where they will actually go, the three set off, driving through rural Mexico. They talk about their relationships and sexual experiences to pass the time: the boys boast about their exploits, while Luisa speaks of Jano and recalls her first love, who died in a motorcycle accident.\n\nDuring an overnight stop, Luisa leaves a tearful message on Jano's answering machine explaining that she has left him. Tenoch enters her motel room in search of shampoo but finds her crying. Luisa seduces him, and the two have sex. Julio sees them through the open door and walks away, upset. Afterward, Julio tells Tenoch he had sex with Tenoch's girlfriend. The next day, Luisa notices the tension between the boys, so she has sex with Julio to equalize their perceived status. An upset Tenoch then reveals that he has had sex with Julio's girlfriend. Julio and Tenoch begin fighting, but stop when Luisa threatens to leave them.\n\nDriving along the coastal road that evening, they chance upon an isolated beach that is actually called Boca del Cielo. Making camp there, they begin to relax and enjoy the ocean, along with the company of a local family. After their campsite is ransacked by a herd of pigs, they spend the night in the nearby village, where Luisa makes another phone call to Jano, bidding him an affectionate but final farewell.\n\nThat evening, Luisa, Julio, and Tenoch get drunk and joke about their sexual transgressions. Julio and Tenoch reveal that they each have frequently had sex with the other's girlfriend. Julio adds that he had sex with Tenoch's mother, but it is unclear whether he is serious. The three dance together sensually and then retire to their room. As Luisa kneels between the boys and stimulates them both, the boys embrace and kiss each other passionately.\n\nThe next morning, the boys wake up together, naked. Tenoch goes outside to vomit, and the boys are eager to return home. The narrator explains that their journey back was quiet and uneventful, and that Luisa stayed behind to explore the nearby coves. The narrator further discloses that the boys' girlfriends broke up with them, and Tenoch and Julio also stopped hanging out.\n\nA year later, in a chance encounter in Mexico City, Tenoch and Julio have a cup of coffee. They awkwardly catch up on each other's lives and news of their mutual friends. Tenoch informs Julio that Luisa died of cancer a month after their trip, and that she had been aware of her prognosis during the time they had spent together. Tenoch excuses himself because his current girlfriend is waiting for him. Before leaving, Tenoch tells Julio he will see him later; however, the narrator reveals that they will never see each other again.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Maribel Verd\u00fa]] as Luisa Cort\u00e9s\n* [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]] as Julio Zapata\n* [[Diego Luna]] as Tenoch Iturbide\n* [[Diana Bracho]] as Silvia Allende de Iturbide\n* Andr\u00e9s Almeida as Diego \"Saba\" Madero\n* Ana L\u00f3pez Mercado as Ana Morelos\n* Nathan Grinberg as Manuel Huerta\n* Ver\u00f3nica Langer as Mar\u00eda Eugenia Calles de Huerta\n* [[Mar\u00eda Aura]] as Cecilia Huerta\n* Juan Carlos Remolina as Alejandro \"Jano\" Montes de Oca\n* [[Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho]] as Narrator\n\nCuar\u00f3n did not want to cast Luna for the role of Tenoch because he was a teen idol and [[telenovela]] star in Mexico. Garc\u00eda Bernal convinced Cuar\u00f3n to hire Luna because their friendship would make the performance of their characters' friendship much easier.  Cuar\u00f3n ultimately hired Luna because he became convinced that their bond would produce a natural and honest performance.<ref name=criterion>{{cite web| title=Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal and Diego Luna on Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n| url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/3263-gael-garcia-bernal-and-diego-luna-on-y-tu-mama-tambien| website=[[The Criterion Collection]]| date=13 August 2014| access-date=14 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nAfter working on ''[[Great Expectations (1998 film)|Great Expectations]]'' and ''[[A Little Princess (1995 film)|A Little Princess]]'', Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n envisioned a film that was not influenced by production techniques used in Hollywood cinema. Cuar\u00f3n wanted to reject commercial production techniques he had used in his previous films, like dollies, close-ups, and dissolves.

Overlaps include a road trip featuring a love triangle, wide shots of a car curving down a road, an omniscient narrator, and a character dancing while staring into the camera.\n\n=== Road movie ===\nIn ''Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n'', Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n reimagined the American [[road movie]] genre to depict Mexico's geography, politics, people, and culture.<ref name=shaw,2013 /> Cuar\u00f3n wanted to use the road-film genre to challenge mid-20th century Latin-American Cinema movements that rejected the pleasure and entertainment typical of Hollywood commercial cinema created by using fictional characters and story.<ref name=smith,2014 /> Cuar\u00f3n aimed to only borrow the pleasure and entertainment of Hollywood cinema to synthesize with political and cultural exploration of Mexico.<ref name=smith,2014 /> Using fictional characters and a story within the documentary-realist style, Cuar\u00f3n was able to explore Mexico's geographical, cultural, and political landscapes.<ref name=smith,2014 />\n\n=== Filming and production ===\nThe director and screenwriter were not afraid of developing ''Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n'' during the production process.<ref name=wood,2006 /> Cuar\u00f3n's script was minimal and unelaborate so the actors could contribute to its development during the rehearsal process.<ref name=wood,2006 /> Throughout the film the actors improvised.<ref name=smith,2014>{{cite book| first=Paul Julian| last=Smith| title=Mexican Screen Fiction: Between Cinema and Television| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BMbDAgAAQBAJ&q=ripstein| location=Cambridge, UK| publisher=Polity Press| date=27 January 2014| isbn=978-0745681252}}</ref> Instead of using high-tech equipment, the entire film was shot with a handheld camera to create a documentary-realist look that mimicked candid footage.

The 18+ rating was administered for strong sexual content, nudity involving teens, drug use, and explicit language, and prevented audiences under 18 from admittance.
