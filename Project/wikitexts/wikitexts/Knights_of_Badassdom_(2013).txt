Their friend Joe Revitt, a slacker, aspiring rockstar, and a fan of [[Heavy metal music|metal music]], is dumped by his girlfriend Beth. Joe's friends Eric and Hung bring him unwillingly to a fantasy [[Live action role-playing|LARP]] event to cheer him up. [[Gamemaster|Game master]] Ronnie Kwok, who was once humiliated by Joe as a result of an embarrassing ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' incident, demands that Eric cast an advanced regeneration spell to allow Joe into the game. Eric recites a random passage from a [[grimoire]] he ordered online to allow Joe into the game, and unknowingly summons a [[succubus]] which resembles Beth.\n\nHung teaches Joe the rules of LARP combat, and Joe begins bonding with a female LARPer named Gwen. She is accompanied by her brutish cousin Gunther, who believes that the LARP event is an actual fantasy world and that he is an actual warrior. After the LARP event begins, the succubus begins murdering LARPers, including Hung and their friend Lando, with Ronnie narrowly escaping. Joe, Eric, Gwen, and Gunther discover the aftermath of the killings, and Ronnie informs Eric that the spell he recited was a genuine [[Enochian]] spell that can summon demons. They are confronted by the succubus, and Eric recites a different spell to mortally wound the succubus, but instead causes it to transform into a large monster.\n\nThe LARP battle of \"Nevermore\" is accidentally started early, and the LARPers begin fighting. Amidst the combat, the LARPers are ambushed by the paintballers from much earlier, who proceed to shoot them, scaring some of them away, while others take a stand against them. To make matters worse, the succubus monster suddenly appears and slaughters many of the LARPers, including Ronnie, and the aforementioned paintballers, with Johnny, one of the assistant game masters being the only survivor, due to Gunther's timely arrival. Joe, Eric, and Gwen arrive to confront the beast, and they manage to pin it in place with the paintballers' truck. Joe, brandishing a mystical gem taken from the spine of the grimoire, sings a spell in a metal style, causing a [[Ghost|spectral]] version of Hung to appear and defeat the monster. Six months later, Joe and Gwen are shown to have started a [[doom metal]] band, vowing to never LARP again, and that Joe has \"gotten over\" his breakup with Beth. In light of the monster's rampage, Gunther's belief that he is an actual warrior is reinforced. Ronnie was posthumously recognized as \"game master extraordinaire\", Eric is learning Enochian, having become a \"27 level sorcerer\", and Hung's fight against the monster is now immortalized as legendary.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ryan Kwanten]] as Joe Revitt<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ryan Kwanten Enlists With \"Knights\" |url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news/17455 |publisher=Darkhorizons.com |accessdate=2010-12-06}}</ref>\n**[[Brendan McCreary]] as Joe's Singing voice\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as Eric<ref>{{Cite web |date=2006-12-05 |title=Steve Zahn Is A Knight Of Badassdom |url=https://www.empireonline.com/news/feed.asp?NID=28089 |publisher=Empireonline.com |accessdate=2010-12-06}}</ref>\n* [[Peter Dinklage]] as Hung<ref>{{Cite web |date=2010-01-20 |title=Peter Dinklage in Talks For Knights of Badassdom |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/2010/01/20/peter-dinklage-in-talks-for-knights-of-badassdom-synopsis-revealed/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923184919/http://www.slashfilm.com/2010/01/20/peter-dinklage-in-talks-for-knights-of-badassdom-synopsis-revealed/ |archive-date=2010-09-23 |publisher=Slashfilm.com |accessdate=2010-12-06}}</ref>\n* [[Summer Glau]] as Gwen<ref>{{Cite web |last=Davis |first=Dave |date=2010-06-09 |title=Peter Dinklage, Steve Zahn and Ryan Kwanten fight a demon |url=https://www.joblo.com/index.php?id=32511 |publisher=Joblo.com |accessdate=2010-12-06}}</ref>\n* [[Margarita Levieva]] as Beth / [[Succubus]]\n* [[Jimmi Simpson]] as Ronnie Kwok<ref>{{Cite web |title=Joe Lynch Talks Knights of Badassdom |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/joe-lynch-talks-knights-of-badassdom |publisher=movieweb.com |accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref>\n* Brett Gipson/[[Tom Hopper]] as Gunther\n* [[Danny Pudi]] as Lando<ref>{{Cite web |title='True Blood' Star Becomes One of the 'Knights of Badassdom' |date=9 June 2010 |url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/20504 |publisher=Bloody-disgusting.com |accessdate=2010-12-06}}</ref>\n* [[Michael Gladis]] as King Diamond\n* [[Douglas Tait (actor)|Douglas Tait]] as Abominog<ref>{{Cite web |title=Knights of Badassdom - Peter Dinklage About to Bludgeon Ryan Kwanten |url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/42718 |publisher=dreadcentral.com |accessdate=2011-02-22}}</ref>\n* [[Brian Posehn]] as Gilberto<ref>{{Cite web |title=IMDB - Knights of Badassdom Full Credits |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1545660/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast |publisher=IMDB.com}}</ref>\n* [[Khanh Doan]] as Andie<ref>{{Cite web |title=IMDB - Knights of Badassdom Full Credits |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1545660/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast |publisher=IMDB.com}}</ref>\n* Basil Harris/Dan Anderson as Eddie\n* Dan Anderson as Johnny\n* [[Joshua Malina]] as Travis\n* Brandon Petty as Jake\n* Kim Stodel as Ira\n\n==Production==\nThe film is directed by [[Joe Lynch (director)|Joe Lynch]],<ref>{{Cite web |date=2010-06-11 |title=Summer Glau Joins Those 'Knights of Badassdom' |url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/b19320_summer_glau_joins_those_knights_of.html |publisher=Fearnet.com |accessdate=2010-12-06}}</ref> and stars [[Peter Dinklage]], [[Ryan Kwanten]],<ref>{{Cite web |date=2010-06-22 |title=Introducing the King of 'The Knights of Badassdom' |url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/20654 |publisher=Bloody-disgusting.com |accessdate=2010-12-06}}</ref> [[Steve Zahn]] and [[Summer Glau]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2010-06-14 |title=Summer Glau Will Kick Ass in The Knights Of Badassdom |url=http://www.beyondhollywood.com/summer-glau-will-kick-ass-in-the-knights-of-badassdom/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617044318/http://www.beyondhollywood.com/summer-glau-will-kick-ass-in-the-knights-of-badassdom/ |archive-date=2010-06-17 |publisher=Beyondhollywood.com |accessdate=2010-12-06}}</ref> Spectral Motion contributed the special effects in the film.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tinnin |first=Drew |date=2010-06-10 |title=Dinklage, Zahn, Kwanten and Pudi sworn in as Knights Of Badassdom |url=http://gordonandthewhale.com/dinklage-zahn-kwanten-and-pudi-sworn-in-as-knights-of-badassdom/ |url-status=dead |publisher=Gordonandthewhale.com |accessdate=2010-12-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212090456/http://gordonandthewhale.com/dinklage-zahn-kwanten-and-pudi-sworn-in-as-knights-of-badassdom/ |archivedate=2010-12-12}}</ref> The film was co-written by Kevin Dreyfuss and Matt Wall.<ref>{{Cite web |title=More Behind-the-Scenes Images: Joe Lynch's The Knights of Badassdom |url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/38472/more-behind-scenes-images-joe-lynchs-the-knights-badassdom |publisher=Dreadcentral.com |accessdate=2010-12-06}}</ref>\n\nFilming began in July 2010<ref>{{Cite web |date=2010-07-12 |title=Pictures Officially Up on 'The Knights of Badassdom'!
