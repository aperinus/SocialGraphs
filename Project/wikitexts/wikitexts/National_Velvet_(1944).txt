She wins a spirited [[gelding]] in a raffle and decides to train him for the [[Grand National]] [[steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase]]. Velvet is aided by a penniless young drifter named Mi Taylor, who discovered Mrs. Brown's name and address among his late father's effects, though he is unaware of why it was there. Hoping to profit from the association, Mi accepts an invitation to dinner and a night's lodging at the Browns' home, but Mrs. Brown is unwilling to allow Mi to trade on his father's good name and remains vague about their connection. Nevertheless, she convinces her husband to hire Mi over his better judgment, and Mi is brought into the home as a hired hand. It is revealed that Mi's career as a jockey ended in a collision which resulted in another jockey's death. Mi has not held a job since, and now hates horses because of the accident.\n\nVelvet names the horse she won \"The Pie\" because his previous owner, Mr. Ede, called the troublesome gelding a pirate. Seeing Pie's natural talent, Velvet pleads with Mi to train him for the Grand National. Mi believes it a fool's errand, not because the horse lacks ability, but because they have no way to finance the effort. He makes his case to Mrs. Brown, but she consents to Velvet's desire to train the horse. To cover the entrance fee and other costs, Mrs. Brown gives Velvet the prize money she won for swimming the English Channel. Velvet and Mi train the horse and enter him into the race.\n\nMi and Velvet travel to the Grand National. Mi hires a professional [[jockey]], but the night before the race, Velvet senses he lacks faith in the Pie and will lose. Velvet dismisses the jockey, leaving them without a rider. That night, Mi overcomes his fear of riding and intends to race Pie himself. He discovers that Velvet has donned the jockey silks and intends to ride. Knowing the dangers, Mi attempts to dissuade Velvet, who is determined to ride. As the race unfolds, Velvet and Pie clear all hurdles and win the race. Elated but exhausted, Velvet falls off her mount just after the finish. However, since rule 144 requires that the winning jockey not dismount before reaching the enclosure, Velvet and Pie are disqualified.  \n\nWhen it is discovered that the jockey is a girl, Velvet becomes a media sensation and is offered large amounts of money to travel to Hollywood and be filmed with Pie. To her father's disappointment, Velvet tearfully refuses the offers, claiming that Pie would dislike being stared at. Velvet says that she raced Pie at the Grand National because he deserved a chance for greatness. Velvet chooses a normal life for her and her horse. At the close of the film, Mi, ready to resume his old life, takes his leave without bidding Velvet goodbye. Before he gets too far, Mrs. Brown gives Velvet permission to reveal her relationship with his father. Velvet gallops off on Pie and finds Mi on the road. The movie ends with a long distance shot of Velvet stoping Mi at the top of a hill against a sunset sky presumably telling Mi about his father.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Mickey Rooney]] as Michael \"Mi\" Taylor\n* [[Elizabeth Taylor]] as Velvet Brown\n* [[Donald Crisp]] as Mr. Herbert Brown\n* [[Angela Lansbury]] as Edwina Brown\n* [[Anne Revere]] as Mrs Araminty Brown\n* [[Jackie 'Butch' Jenkins]] as Donald Brown\n* [[Juanita Quigley]] as Malvolia \"Mally\" Brown\n* [[Arthur Treacher]] as Race Patron\n* [[Reginald Owen]] as Farmer Ede\n* [[Norma Varden]] as Miss Sims\n* [[Terry Kilburn]] as Theodore \"Ted\"\n* [[Arthur Shields]] as Mr. Hallam\n* [[Aubrey Mather]] as Entry official\n* [[Alec Craig]] as Timothy \"Tim\"\n* [[Eugene Loring]] as Ivan Taski\n* [[Jane Isbell]] as Schoolgirl Jane\n* Matthew Boulton as Entry official\n* King Charles as the horse, The Pie <ref>{{cite book|last=Eagan|first=Daniel|title=America's film legacy : the authoritative guide to the landmark movies in the National Film Registry|year=2010|publisher=Continuum|location=New York|isbn=978-0826429773|page=[https://archive.org/details/americasfilmlega0000eaga/page/380 380]|url=https://archive.org/details/americasfilmlega0000eaga|url-access=registration|quote=national velvet movie.|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}</ref>\n* [[Gordon Richards (actor)|Gordon Richards]] as Doctor\n* Barry Macollum as a townsman (uncredited)\n* [[Gerald Oliver Smith]] as a cameraman (uncredited)\n* [[Harry Allen (actor)|Harry Allen]] as van driver (uncredited)\n* [[Mona Freeman]] as schoolgirl (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production notes==\nAn 18-year-old [[Gene Tierney]], who was then appearing on Broadway, was offered the role of Velvet Brown in 1939. Production was delayed, however, so Tierney returned to Broadway.<ref>Tierney and Herskowitz (1978) Wyden Books. \"Self-Portrait\". pg.23</ref> Much of the film was shot in [[Pebble Beach, California]], with the most-scenic views on the [[Pebble Beach Golf Links]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montereymovietours.com/media_sacbee.html |title=Monterey Movie Tours! |publisher=Monterey Movie Tours! |date=2003-08-10 |access-date=2016-10-26}}</ref> (with golf holes visible in the background). Elizabeth Taylor was given \"The Pie\" as a birthday gift after filming was over.\n\nThis was the first of two films casting Elizabeth Taylor and Anne Revere. The other film, ''[[A Place in the Sun (1951 film)|A Place in the Sun]]'', featured Revere as the mother of Taylor's love interest, played by [[Montgomery Clift]]. In that film, however, the two actresses never shared the screen with each other in any scene.\n\nMickey Rooney's scenes were shot first in one month allotted by the U.S. Army before Rooney was inducted in June 1944.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://army.togetherweserved.com/army/servlet/tws.webapp.WebApps?cmd=ShadowBoxProfile&type=Person&ID=336424|title=Rooney, Mickey, Pfc Deceased|work=army.togetherweserved.com|access-date=August 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\nMickey Rooney played a similar role in the film ''Black Stallion'' (1979).\n\n===Differences from the book===\nThe film differs from the book in a number of respects. For example, Velvet's horse in the book is a [[piebald]], and thus is given the name \"The Piebald\" or \"The Pie\" for short. In the movie, Pie is a [[Chestnut (coat)|chestnut]], and another explanation for his name was given. Velvet, in the book, is a sickly child who is given to great imagination and spirit; her father is stern and given to anger, but the mother is stronger still and stands up to him. Since her days as a swimmer, she has become a large woman and weighs 16 [[Stone (unit)|stone]]\u2014{{convert|224|lb|kg}} at the time of the story, and warns Velvet never to allow herself to be burdened by weight. In the book Mr. and Mrs. Brown also have a 15-year-old daughter named Meredith, in addition to Edwina, Malvolia, Velvet, and Donald. In the novel, the professional jockey hired by Mi to race at the Grand National is said to have finished in 4th place at the previous event, it is possible this character is a reference to 1932 Ascot Gold Cup disgraced competitor Arthur Pasquier.  The Meredith character does not appear in the movie.\n\n==Song==\n* \"Summertime\" - Elizabeth Taylor, Angela Lansbury, Juanita Quigley, MGM Studio and Orchestra Chorus Girls, and Norma Varden\n\n==Reception==\n''National Velvet'' holds a 100% 'Fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 8.09/10.
