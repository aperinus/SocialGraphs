A [[remake]] of [[Eiichi Kudo]]'s 1963 [[Jidaigeki|Japanese period drama]] film ''[[13 Assassins (1963 film)|13 Assassins]]'', it is set in 1844 toward the end of the [[Edo period]] in which a group of thirteen assassins\u2014comprising twelve samurai and a hunter\u2014secretly plot to assassinate Lord [[Matsudaira Naritsugu]], the murderous leader of the [[Akashi Domain|Akashi clan]], to thwart his appointment to the powerful Shogunate Council.\n\nThe film marks the third collaboration in which Yamada and Takaoka co-starred, the first two being ''[[Crows Zero]]'' and ''[[Crows Zero 2]]'', both directed by Miike. [[Principal photography]] took place over two months, from July to September 2009, in [[Tsuruoka, Yamagata]], in northern Japan. The film opened in Japan on 25{{nbsp}}September 2010 and in the United States on 29{{nbsp}}April 2011. It received critical acclaim from western critics, who compared it favourably to [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s oeuvre.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the year 1844 of the [[Edo Period]], as the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] is in decline, the sadistic Lord [[Matsudaira Naritsugu]] of [[Akashi Domain|Akashi]] rapes, tortures, mutilates and murders nobles and commoners at will. He is shielded because the [[Sh\u014dgun]] is his half-brother. Sir [[Doi Toshitsura]], the Sh\u014dgun's Justice Minister, realizes that when Naritsugu ascends to the Shogunate Council, civil war will break out between the Sh\u014dgun and the many [[Daimy\u014d|feudal lords]] Naritsugu has offended. Then, the feudal lord of the Mamiya clan publicly commits [[seppuku]] as a protest against the Sh\u014dgun's refusal to punish Lord Naritsugu, who has personally murdered the feudal lord's entire family. When the Sh\u014dgun still insists upon Naritsugu's promotion, Sir{{nbsp}}Doi seeks out a trusted older samurai, Shimada Shinzaemon, who served under the former sh\u014dgun, and secretly hires him to assassinate Naritsugu. However, Naritsugu's loyal retainers led by Hanbei, an old contemporary of Shinzaemon, learn of the plot by spying on Doi.\n\nShinzaemon gathers eleven trusted samurai including Shinzaemon's nephew, Shinrokur\u014d, who together plan to ambush Naritsugu on his [[Sankin-k\u014dtai|official journey]] from [[Edo]] to his lands in Akashi. Just before they leave, Hanbei arrives and warns his old colleague that he will suffer grave consequences if he tries to kill Naritsugu.\n\nThe group, with the legal authority and financial assistance of Doi, buy the help of the town of [[Ochiai-juku|Ochiai]] in order to create a trap. They also enlist the help of Makino, a feudal lord whose daughter-in-law was raped and son murdered by Naritsugu. With troops, Makino blocks the official highway, forcing Naritsugu to head into the trap; Makino then disembowels himself to conceal his own involvement in the conspiracy. During the assassins' journey to the town, they are attacked by [[r\u014dnin]] who have been paid off by Hanbei to kill the plotters. The group decides to head through the mountains but end up getting lost. In the process they encounter a hunter named Kiga Koyata who becomes their guide and later the thirteenth assassin.\n\nThe town is converted into an elaborate maze of booby traps and camouflaged fortifications. When Naritsugu and his retinue arrive, their numbers have been augmented by additional troops. The 13 assassins are no longer facing 70 men-at-arms; now they face at least 200. A lengthy battle follows, with Naritsugu and his guards trapped inside the village and attacked on all sides by arrows, explosives, knives, and swords - with the exception of Koyata, who fights with rocks in slings and with sticks. In the midst of the carnage, the sadistic Naritsugu is aroused by the bloodshed of the battle. He tells Hanbei that when he ascends to the Sh\u014dgun's council he will bring back the wars of the [[Sengoku Period]].\n\nThe assassins are killed one by one, but not before they kill nearly all of the Akashi forces. Eventually, Naritsugu and Hanbei, along with two retainers, are the last remaining of the Naritsugu's party, and are confronted by Shinzaemon and Shinrokur\u014d. After Shinzaemon kills Hanbei, Naritsugu kicks his loyal retainer's head away, insulting the samurai who has given his life for him. Contemptuously, he announces that the people and the samurai have only one purpose: to serve their lords. Shinzaemon counters by telling Naritsugu that lords cannot live without the support of the people and that, if a lord abuses his power, the people will always rise up against him. Naritsugu and Shinzaemon mortally wound each other. Crying, crawling in the mud, and experiencing fear and pain for the first time, the lord thanks Shinzaemon for showing him excitement. Shinzaemon then decapitates him.\n\nShinrokur\u014d wanders through the carnage and meets the hunter Koyata who, having suffered a fatal injury earlier, runs up to him with characteristic vigor, unharmed. They make their separate ways out of the town after they briefly discuss how they intend to live their lives from then onwards. An [[epilogue]] states that the Sh\u014dgun and his government covered up what really occurred, announcing that Naritsugu died of illness on the journey back to his lands. Twenty-three years later, the Tokugawa Shogunate would be overthrown during the [[Meiji Restoration]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n  | direction = vertical\n  | width   = 120\n  | footer  = ''Top to bottom'': K\u014dji Yakusho, Takayuki Yamada and Y\u016bsuke Iseya\n  | image1  = Yakusho Koji \"The World of Harada Masato\" at Opening Ceremony of the 28th Tokyo International Film Festival (22403788836) (cropped).jpg\n  | alt1   =\n  | caption1 =\n  | image2  = NYAFF 2011 Star Asia Awards - TAKAYUKI YAMADA - 18.jpg\n  | alt2   = \n  | caption2 =\n  | image3  = Toyota MARK X ZiO \u767a\u8868\u4f1a - \u4f0a\u52e2\u8c37\u53cb\u4ecb.jpg\n  | alt3   = \n  | caption3 =\n}}\n\n{{hatnote|Character names follow the pattern of [[Japanese name]]s, with the family [[surname]] placed first''.}}\n* [[Goro Inagaki|Gor\u014d Inagaki]] as Lord [[Matsudaira Naritsugu]]:<ref name=identitytheory>{{cite news|last1=Ryan |first1=David C. |title=Film Essay: The Natural Supernaturalism of the 13 Assassins |url=http://www.identitytheory.com/film-essay-the-natural-supernaturalism-of-the-13-assassins/ |access-date=31 March 2017 |work=[[Identity Theory (webzine)|Identity Theory]] |date=14 November 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401055507/http://www.identitytheory.com/film-essay-the-natural-supernaturalism-of-the-13-assassins/ |archive-date= 1 April 2017 }}</ref> The ruler of the [[Akashi Domain]].

Nakazawa had previously worked with director Takashi Miike on ''[[The Bird People in China]]'' and ''[[Andromedia]]'' (both in 1998), ''[[Yakuza Demon]]'' (2003), and ''[[Sukiyaki Western Django]]'' (2007).<ref name=thr/> At the start of production, Thomas said he was pleased to be working again with \"wonderful Japanese filmmakers like Toshiaki Nakazawa and Takashi Miike, whose work speaks for itself as being amongst the most successful and innovative coming from Japan\". Nakazawa replied that he would like Thomas \"to wear a sword also, and with one more assassin, together we will send out the fourteen assassins over there\".<ref name=thr/> Of his approach in directing the film, Miike said:\n\n{{blockquote|text=I felt that all of us working on our remake of ''13 Assassins'' had to honour the original director, Eiichi Kudo, and everyone else who created the original. It was important to avoid doing what most modern-day ''chanbara'' do, which is to insert a love story, or interpose modern-day mindsets. Over the years, people have remade Kurosawa movies, but failed every time because they have not been able to adapt the story into something young audiences can understand.<ref name=guardian2>{{cite news|last1=Miike |first1=Takashi |author-link=Takashi Miike |title=Takashi Miike: Why I am bringing Japanese classics back to life |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/05/takeshi-miike-japanese-samurai-classics |access-date=13 May 2017 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=5 May 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916163725/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/05/takeshi-miike-japanese-samurai-classics |archive-date=16 September 2016 }}</ref>}}\n\nHaving been a fan of [[K\u014dji Yakusho]]'s acting, Miike made it a priority that he be cast in the leading role.
