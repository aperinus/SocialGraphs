Armstrong]] in his [[list of directorial debuts|directorial debut]].\n\n==Plot==\nAn old gangster, with a hard drive containing records of who he paid off, is targeted by a competition between dirty cops, internal affairs, etc.   The dirty cops hire a thug to get into the safe (in the back of a diner) at midnight. But he brings his friends and goes too early for the time-release lock. Another crooked cop shows up (for uncertain reasons). The shooting ensues and during hostage negotiations the thug tries to put the blame onto an ex-con who just got out of jail, so that no one notices the real target is the hard drive.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Forest Whitaker]] as Will\n*[[Michael Chiklis]] as Derrick\n*[[Stephen Lang]] as Charlie\n*[[Ray Liotta]] as Man in the Suit\n*[[Nikki Reed]] as Amanda\n*[[Common (rapper)|Common]] as Jeff Porter\n*[[Marton Csokas]] as Lt Barnes\n*[[Max Beesley]] as Billy\n*[[Jonathan Bennett (actor)|Jonathan Bennett]] as Aaron\n*Cameron Denny as Nigel\n*[[Jessica Szohr]] as Bonnie\n*[[Sean Faris]] as Nick Davenport\n*[[Ronald Guttman]] as Yuri Mikelov\n*[[Jordan Belfi]] as Patrick\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|pawn_2013}}\n\n[[Category:2013 films]]\n[[Category:2013 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:American crime drama films]]\n[[Category:2013 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Connecticut]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]\n\n\n{{2010s-crime-drama-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
