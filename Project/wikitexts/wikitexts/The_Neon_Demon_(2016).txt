In the United States, the film was released theatrically on June 24, 2016 by [[Amazon Studios]] and [[Broad Green Pictures]]. It opened to polarized reviews, and ultimately grossed a little over $3 million against a $7 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing the death of her parents, sixteen<!-- DO NOT CHANGE TO 19. Sixteen is correct. She has to lie about her age to get jobs. One of the agents helps her get a fake ID -->-year-old aspiring model Jesse has just moved from small-town [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to [[Los Angeles]]. She meets photographer Dean, who does her first shoot, and makeup artist Ruby, who introduces fellow older models Sarah and Gigi, who are interested in her physical appearance and her sexual activities, which Jesse feigns to have.\n\nJesse is signed by Roberta Hoffman, the owner of a modeling agency, who tells her to pretend she is nineteen and refers her to a test shoot with notable photographer Jack McCarther. The shoot is successful, and Gigi and Sarah envy Jesse's youth. Jesse goes to a [[casting call]] for fashion designer Robert Sarno where Sarah is also present. Sarno pays no attention to Sarah but is entranced by Jesse. A distraught Sarah asks her how it feels to be the one everyone admires. Jesse admits, \"It's everything\" and Sarah lunges toward her, subsequently cutting Jesse's hand on glass. Sarah sucks the blood from Jesse's hand and Jesse rushes back to her motel and faints, hallucinating abstract imagery.\n\nAt Sarno's fashion show, Gigi tells Jesse about the [[cosmetic surgery]]. As Jesse is closing the show, she hallucinates abstract triangular shapes and reflections of herself. After the show, a visibly-changed Jesse goes out with Dean to a bar, where Sarno negatively compares Gigi to Jesse, saying Gigi is not truly beautiful because of her surgery while Jesse is naturally beautiful. Dean, who disputes Sarno's opinions, requests Jesse to leave, who refuses and now espouses a [[narcissism|narcissistic]] persona.\n\nJesse has a nightmare of being forced by Hank, the lecherous motel owner, to sexually swallow a knife. She wakes up to hear someone fidgeting with her door lock. She quickly turns the deadbolt, but is left to listen as the intruder breaks into the next room and assaults the thirteen-year-old female occupant inside. Terrified, she calls Ruby, who invites Jesse to her home. Ruby makes sexual advances towards Jesse but is rejected by Jesse, revealing herself to be a virgin. Ruby then leaves for her second job as a makeup artist at a [[morgue]], where she [[necrophilia|pleasures herself with a female corpse]].\n\nRuby returns home and finds Jesse now unabashed in her narcissism. Jesse encounters Sarah and Gigi, who attack her and chase her to Ruby, who pushes her into an empty swimming pool, breaking her leg and causing her blood to flow. The women then approach her with knives. After they butcher Jesse and [[Human cannibalism|consume parts of her body]], they all bathe in her blood. Ruby is revealed to have [[occult]] tattoos. She lies in Jesse's unmarked grave, and later, nude in her house as a torrent of blood gushes from her genitals as she urinates.\n\nThe next day, Sarah and Gigi attend one of Jack's shoots with another model named Annie. Jack is suddenly enthralled with Sarah and fires Annie. In the midst of the shoot, Gigi falls ill and leaves. Sarah watches Gigi vomit up one of Jesse's eyeballs. She screams with regret, \"I need to get her out of me\", and stabs herself with a pair of scissors. Sarah watches Gigi die and eats the regurgitated eyeball before returning to the shoot.\n\nThe end credits scene shows a woman, who does not show her face, walking alone in the [[Mojave Desert]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n*[[Elle Fanning]] as Jesse \n*[[Karl Glusman]] as Dean\n*[[Jena Malone]] as Ruby\n*[[Bella Heathcote]] as Gigi\n*[[Abbey Lee]] as Sarah\n*[[Desmond Harrington]] as Jack McCarther\n*[[Christina Hendricks]] as Roberta Hoffman\n*[[Keanu Reeves]] as Hank\n*[[Alessandro Nivola]] as Robert Sarno\n*[[Charles Baker (actor)|Charles Baker]] as Mikey\n*[[Jamie Clayton]] as Casting Director\n*Houda Shretah as Sarno's assistant\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Nicolas Winding Refn Cannes 2016.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Director [[Nicolas Winding Refn]] promoting the film at the [[2016 Cannes Film Festival]].]]\n\nOn October 22, 2013, it was announced that Refn's new film after ''[[Only God Forgives]]'' would be a Miami- or Tokyo-set \"all-female horror\" with \"lots of sex\" called ''I Walk with the Dead'', with [[Carey Mulligan]] attached to star and [[Polly Stenham]] writing the script.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/532180/nicolas-winding-refn-i-walk-with-the-dead/|title=Nicolas Winding Refn's Next Film Is 'I Walk With The Dead'|date=June 6, 2014 |access-date=June 6, 2014}}</ref> On November 3, 2014, Refn's production company [[Space Rocket Nation]] alongside its co-financiers [[Gaumont Film Company]] and [[Wild Bunch (film company)|Wild Bunch]] announced that Refn's next film would be titled ''The Neon Demon'', to be filmed in Los Angeles in early 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nordiskfilmogtvfond.com/index.php/news/stories/nicolas-winding-refn-readies-danishfrench-horror-tale/|title=Nordisk Film & TV Fond :: Nicolas Winding Refn Readies Danish/French Horror Tale|access-date=January 20, 2015}}</ref> Refn commented on the conception of the project: \"I woke up one morning a couple of years ago and was like, 'Well, I was never born beautiful, but my wife is,' and I wondered what it had been like going through life with that reality,\" he says. \"I came up with the idea to do a horror film about beauty, not to criticize it or to attack it, but because beauty is a very complex subject.

It\u2019s set in the Los Angeles fashion world, and it\u2019s the kind of movie in which models look like mannequins that look like slasher-film corpses, and corpses look like love objects. Beauty mingles with mangled flesh, and each fastidiously slick image seems to have come out of ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'' or ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' or a very sick version of a [[Calvin Klein]] commercial. Every scene, every shot, every line of dialogue, every pause is so hypnotically composed, so luxuriously overdeliberate, that the audience can't help but assume that Refn knows exactly what he's doing \u2013 that he's setting us up for the kill.
