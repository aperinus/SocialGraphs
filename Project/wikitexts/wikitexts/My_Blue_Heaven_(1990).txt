This is the third film in which Martin and Moranis starred together. It has been noted for its relationship to ''[[Goodfellas]]'', which was released one month later. Both films are based on the life of [[Henry Hill (mobster)|Henry Hill]], although the character is renamed \"Vincent 'Vinnie' Antonelli\" in ''My Blue Heaven''. ''Goodfellas'' was based on the book ''[[Wiseguy (book)|Wiseguy]]'' by [[Nicholas Pileggi]], while the screenplay for ''My Blue Heaven'' was written by Pileggi's wife Nora Ephron, and much of the research for both works was done in the same sessions with Hill.<ref name=\"Hill2007\">{{cite book |last=Hill |first=Henry |author-link=Henry Hill |title=Gangsters and Goodfellas: The Mob, Witness Protection, and Life on the Run |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Hdz6sdz0XwC&pg=PA270 |date=February 2007 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1-59077-129-7 |pages=225\u2013226}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nVinnie Antonelli is a former mobster recently inducted into the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|Witness Protection Program]] with his wife, Linda. The two are under the watchful eye of federal agent Barney Coopersmith. Vinnie and Barney soon find common ground when both of their wives leave them due to their lifestyles. While he succeeds in getting Vinnie to a suburb in California and a private home, Barney has one more problem: he must make sure the jovial and sometimes mischievous Vinnie conforms to Witness Protection protocol until he testifies against mob kingpins.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Vinnie Antonelli / Tod Wilkinson\n* [[Rick Moranis]] as Barney Coopersmith\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Hannah Stubbs\n* [[Melanie Mayron]] as Crystal Rybak\n* [[Bill Irwin]] as Kirby\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Shaldeen\n* [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]] as Billy Sparrow / Johnny Bird\n* [[Deborah Rush]] as Linda Antonelli\n* [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as Will Stubbs\n* [[Jesse Bradford]] as Jamie Stubbs\n* [[Corey Carrier]] as Tommie Stubbs\n* Seth Jaffe as Umberto Mello\n* Robert Miranda as Lilo Mello\n* [[Ed Lauter]] as Robert Underwood\n* [[Julie Bovasso]] as Vinnie's mother\n* [[Colleen Camp]] as Dr. Margaret Snow Coopersmith\n* [[Gordon Currie (actor)|Gordon Currie]] as Wally Bunting\n* [[Raymond O'Connor]] as Dino\n* [[Troy Evans (actor)|Troy Evans]] as Nicky\n* [[Carol Ann Susi]] as Filomena\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\nEphron first pitched the idea for the film to [[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Anthea Sylbert]] (who went on to produce the film) in 1987.<ref name=\"latimes.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-05-27-tm-441-story.html|title = THE MOVIES : The fine art of MAKING THE DEAL|website = [[Los Angeles Times]]|date = May 27, 1990}}</ref> After Hawn left the project in 1989, Steve Martin was cast to play Coopersmith, with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] playing the role of Antonelli. However, Schwarzenegger was offered the role of Det. John Kimble in ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'' and left the production. Failing to find another suitable \"Vinnie\" for Martin's Coopersmith ([[Danny DeVito]] turned down the role), Martin offered to take on the part of Vinnie himself. Producers agreed, and then cast [[Rick Moranis]] as Coopersmith, who had originally been considered for the role, but was unavailable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://redknotstudio.com/compleatsteve/actor/blueheaven_2.htm |title=The Compleat Steve :: About Steve :: Actor :: Movies :: My Blue Heaven Page 2 |publisher=Redknotstudio.com |date=1990-08-16 |access-date=2010-07-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715165343/http://redknotstudio.com/compleatsteve/actor/blueheaven_2.htm |archive-date=July 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"latimes.com\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began in October 1989.
