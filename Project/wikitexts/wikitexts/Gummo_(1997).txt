The film is set (but was not filmed) in [[Xenia, Ohio]], a [[Midwestern America]]n town that had been previously struck by [[Xenia Tornado|a devastating tornado]]. The loose narrative follows several main characters who find odd and destructive ways to pass time, interrupted by vignettes depicting other inhabitants of the town.\n\nKorine's [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]], the film was shot in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], on a budget of $1.3 million. ''Gummo'' was [[Limited release|not given a large theatrical release]] and failed to generate large box office revenues. The film generated substantial press for its graphic content and stylized, loosely woven narrative.\n\n==Plot==\nA young boy named Solomon narrates the events of [[1974 Super Outbreak|the tornado]] that devastated the small town of [[Xenia, Ohio]]. A [[Muteness|mute]] [[adolescence|adolescent]] boy, known as Bunny Boy, wears only pink bunny ears, shorts, and tennis shoes on an overpass in the rain.\n\nTummler, a friend of Solomon, carries a cat by the scruff of its neck and drowns it in a barrel of water. The film then cuts to a different scene with Tummler, in a wrecked car with a girl. They fondle each other, and Tummler realizes there is a lump in one of the girl's breasts. Tummler and Solomon then ride down a hill on bikes. In narration, Solomon describes Tummler as a boy with \"a marvelous persona,\u201d whom some people call \"downright evil.\u201d\n\nLater, Tummler aims an air rifle at a cat. Solomon stops him from killing the cat, protesting that it is a housecat. They leave and the camera follows the cat to its owners' house. The cat is owned by three sisters, two of whom are teenagers and one who is pre-[[Puberty|pubescent]]. The film cuts back to Tummler and Solomon hunting [[feral]] cats, which they deliver to a local grocer who intends to butcher and sell them to a local restaurant. The grocer tells them that they have a rival in the cat killing business. Tummler and Solomon buy glue from the grocer, which they use to get high via [[Inhalant abuse|huffing]].\n\nThe film then cuts to a scene in which two [[Profanity|foul-mouthed]] young boys dressed as cowboys destroy things in a junkyard. Bunny Boy arrives and the other boys shoot him \"dead\" with [[cap gun]]s. Bunny Boy plays dead and the boys curse at him, rifle through his pockets, then remove and throw one of his shoes. They grow bored with this and leave Bunny Boy sprawled on the ground.\n\nTummler and Solomon track down a local boy who is poaching \"their\" cats. The poacher, named Jarrod Wiggley, is poisoning the cats rather than shooting them. When Tummler and Solomon break into Jarrod's house with masks and weapons with intent to hurt him, they find photos of the young teen in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] and his elderly grandmother, who is [[Catatonia|catatonic]] and attached to [[life support]] machinery. Jarrod is forced to care for her, which he had earlier opined was \"disgusting.\u201d Seeing that Jarrod isn't home, Tummler and Solomon decide to leave. Tummler then discovers the grandmother lying in her bed, states that it is \"no way to live,\" and turns off the life support machine.\n\nA number of other scenes are interspersed throughout the film, including: an intoxicated man flirting with a [[Homosexuality|gay]] [[Dwarfism|dwarf]]; a man pimping his [[Down syndrome|disabled]] sister to Solomon and Tummler; the sisters encountering an elderly [[Child sexual abuse|child molester]]; a pair of twin boys selling candy door-to-door; a brief conversation with a tennis player who is treating his [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]]; a long scene of Solomon eating dinner while taking a bath in dirty water; a drunken party with [[Arm wrestling|arm-]] and chair-wrestling; and two [[skinhead]] brothers boxing each other in their kitchen. There are also a number of even smaller scenes depicting [[Satanism|Satanic rituals]], footage seemingly from home movies, and conversations containing racial bigotry.\n\nThe next scene in the movie is set to the song \"[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]\" by [[Roy Orbison]], which had been previously mentioned by Tummler as the song his older sibling, who was a [[transsexual]], would sing (the sibling eventually went to the \"Big City\" and abandoned him). The final scene involves Solomon and Tummler shooting the sisters' cat repeatedly with their air rifles in the rain with jump cuts to Bunny Boy kissing the teenage girls in a swimming pool. Bunny Boy runs towards the camera through a field holding the body of the dead cat, which he shows to the audience, breaking the [[fourth wall]].\n\nThe final scene shows a girl, who shaved her eyebrows earlier in the movie, singing \"[[Jesus Loves Me]]\" in bed next to her mom (or sister). The film finally cuts to black as the girl singing is told to \"dial it down\" and go to bed.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jacob Reynolds]] as Solomon\n* Nick Sutton as Tummler\n* [[Linda Manz]] as Solomon's mother\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] as Dot\n* Carisa Glucksman as Helen\n* Darby Dougherty as Darby\n* Jacob Sewell as Bunny Boy\n* [[Mark Gonzales]] as Chair wrestler\n* [[Max Perlich]] as Cole\n* Daniel Martin as Jarrod Wiggley\n* [[Harmony Korine]] as Boy on couch\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Pre-production===\nIn writing ''Gummo'', [[Harmony Korine]] abandoned traditional three-act plot structure and worked to avoid creating characters of a clear-cut moral dimension. In favor of a collage-like assembly, Korine focused on forming interesting moments and scenes, that when put in succession would become its own unique narrative. To justify such a chaotic assembly, Korine set his film in Xenia, Ohio which had been hit by a tornado in 1974.<ref name=\"forward\"/>\n\nTo help him achieve his vision, Korine sought out French cinematographer [[Jean-Yves Escoffier]]. His work on [[Leos Carax]]'s ''[[Les Amants du Pont-Neuf]]'' made a tremendous impression on Korine. Escoffier, who liked the script, worked on ''Gummo'' for a fraction of his usual rate.<ref name=\"forward\"/>\n\nDuring the months of pre-production, Korine scouted for locations in his hometown of [[Nashville, Tennessee]], finding unusual and distinctive homes to shoot in. Korine often approached people on the street, in bowling alleys and in fast food restaurants and asked them to play a part in his movie. Korine notes, \"This is where I grew up. These people are interesting to me, and I'd never seen them represented on screen in a true way.\"<ref name=\"forward\"/>\n\n[[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] designed the costumes for the film, mixing pieces that people already owned with items bought at local thrift stores.<ref name=\"forward\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nKorine cast the film almost entirely with local non-actors. Old friends were eager to help Korine, such as the two skinhead brothers, skateboarder [[Mark Gonzales]], and dwarf Bryant Krenshaw. Some exceptions include Korine's then-girlfriend [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]], [[Linda Manz]], and [[Max Perlich]].\n\nOn [[Linda Manz]], Korine stated, \"I had always admired her. There was this sense about her that I liked \u2013 it wasn't even acting. It was like the way I felt about [[Buster Keaton]] when I first saw him. There was a kind of poetry about her, a glow. They both burnt off the screen.\"<ref name=\"Walczak\">Walczak, Dantek. 1997. \"[http://www.harmony-korine.com/paper/int/hk/indexmag.html Harmony Korine Interview].\" ''Index Magazine''. Retrieved 2009-11-01.</ref> ''Gummo'' was her first screen appearance in 16 years.\n\nKorine spotted his two main characters while watching cable television. Korine noticed [[Jacob Reynolds]] in a short role in ''[[The Road to Wellville (film)|The Road to Wellville]]''. \"He was so visual... I never get tired of looking at his face.\"<ref name=\"forward\"/> The character of Solomon, played by Reynolds, is described in Korine's script as looking \"like no other kid in the world.\"<ref name=\"screenplay\">{{cite book | last = Korine | first = Harmony | author-link = Harmony Korine | title = Harmony Korine: Collected Screenplays, Volume 1 | publisher = [[Faber and Faber]] | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-571-21002-3}}</ref>\n\n[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0840371/ Nick Sutton] (Tummler) was spotted on a drug prevention episode of ''The Sally Jesse Raphael Show'' called \"My Child Died From Sniffing Paint\".

There was a beauty about him.\" Producer Scott Macaulay on Sutton stated, \"He's this person that Harmony sort of found and put in the middle of this movie, which is at times realistic and at times magical. I think of Nick as being Harmony's equivalent of [[Werner Herzog|Herzog's]] [[Bruno Schleinstein|Bruno S.]]\"<ref name=\"forward\"/> (See ''[[The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser]]'' and ''[[Stroszek]]'').\n\nKorine cast his actors not by how they read lines, but by the visual aura they put off.<ref name=\"cunha\">Cunha, Tom. 1997-10-06. \"[http://www.harmony-korine.com/paper/int/hk/conversation.html A Conversation with Harmony Korine]\". IndieWire. Retrieved 2009-11-06.</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot in some of Nashville's poorest neighborhoods. Producer [[Cary Woods]] comments, \"we're essentially seeing the kind of poverty that we're used to seeing in Third World countries when news crews are covering famines, [but] seeing that in the heart of America.\" One small home housed fifteen people and several thousand cockroaches. Bugs literally crawled up and down the walls.<ref name=\"forward\"/> Korine comments, \"we had to take out stuff to be able to put the camera in the room.\"<ref name=\"kelly\">Kelly, Mike. Fall 1997. \"[http://www.harmony-korine.com/paper/int/hk/kelley.html Mike Kelly Interviews Harmony Korine]\". FilmMaker. Retrieved 2009-11-06.</ref> At times, the crew rebelled against filming in such conditions and Korine was forced to purchase [[hazmat suits]] for them to wear. Korine and Escoffier, who thought this was offensive, \"wore Speedos and flip-flops just to piss them off.\"<ref name=\"whammo\"/>\n\nKorine encouraged improvisation and spontaneity. To achieve this, Korine had to establish a mode of trust. \"If an actor is a crack smoker, let him go out between takes, smoke crack, and then come back and throw his refrigerator out the window! Let people feel they can do whatever they want with no consequence.\"<ref name=\"kelly\"/> Producer Scott Macaulay commented the improvisational methods yielded deep results for everyone involved. \"For a lot of the non-actors, you sensed that it was a very emotional experience for them, and that they were tapping into something important.\"<ref name=\"forward\"/> Korine adds, \"I wanted to show what it was like to sniff glue. I didn't want to judge anybody. This is why I have very little interest in working with actors. [Non-actors] can give you what an actor can never give you: pieces of themselves.\"<ref name=\"kelly\"/>\n\nOn the last day of shooting, Escoffier shot the chair-wrestling kitchen scene alone with a rigged boom on his camera. Some people had just gotten out of prison and Korine felt the performance would be greater if he wasn't in the room. The crew shut all the doors and turned off all the monitors, so no one knew what was going on. In between takes, Korine would run in and get everyone hyped up. At the end of the scene there is a moment of silence where no one knows what to do next. Korine comments, \"When I saw that in the dailies, it amazed me, because Jean Yves really captured that awkwardness, that sad silence; it was beautiful.\"<ref name=\"whammo\"/>\n\nKorine shot ''Gummo'' in just four weeks during the summer of 1996, most of the film being shot on the final week of production. This was due to the crew waiting for rain. The last scene shot is the one with Korine starring as a heavily intoxicated boy on a couch with a dwarf.\n\nAny scenes appearing to show violence against animals were simulated, sometimes using prosthetic animals.<ref>Film, closing credits.</ref>\n\n===Editing===\nKorine worked with editor Chris Tellefsen to synthesize the pre-planned footage with the \"mistake-ist\" footage:\n<blockquote>\"When we switched forms, when the film went to video, Hi-8, or Polaroids \u2013 I wanted everything to feel like it was done for a reason. Like they shot it on video because they couldn\u2019t get it onto 35mm, or they shot it on Polaroids because that was the only camera that was there...There was a script, but as a screenwriter, I\u2019m so bored with the idea of following a script. I felt like I had the movie in the script, so we shot the script but then shot everything else and made sense of it all in the editing process.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/40404-from-the-archives-mike-kelley-interviews-harmony-korine/|title=From the Archives: Mike Kelley Interviews Harmony Korine|work=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]]|date=Fall 1997|access-date=January 1, 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\nKorine said that he used footage from any source he could find that fit the aesthetic: \"That cat tape was a tape that a friend of mine had given me, of him doing acid with his sister. They were in a garage band and there was a shot of their kitten. That [phasing] was an in-camera mistake.\"<ref name=\"kelly\"/>\n\nThe final film is about 75% scripted.<ref name=\"kelly\"/>\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Gummo (soundtrack)}}\n''Gummo''{{'}}s soundtrack paints a wide canvas of American pop-culture, ranging from [[Almeda Riddle]]'s field recording of the traditional children's song \"My Little Rooster\", to the [[stoner metal]] of the California band [[Sleep (band)|Sleep]]. Other popular songs include [[Buddy Holly]]'s \"Everyday\" and [[Roy Orbison]]'s \"Crying\", which closes the film and is directly referenced in the dialogue.\n\nMetal and [[powerviolence]] bands such as [[Bethlehem (band)|Bethlehem]], Mystifier, [[Absu (band)|Absu]], [[Burzum]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Brujeria (band)|Brujeria]], [[Eyehategod]] and [[Spazz (band)|Spazz]] are also featured.<ref name=\"AMG-Gummo OST\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r328668|pure_url=yes}} | title=''Gummo'' \u2013 Original Soundtrack | work=[[Allmusic]]| access-date=2008-02-18}}</ref> Korine later showed interest in [[black metal]] subculture in his 2000 visual series ''The Sigil of the Cloven Hoof Marks Thy Path''.\n\n==Themes==\nThe film explores a broad range of issues including drug abuse, violence, homicide, vandalism, mental illness, poverty, profanity, homophobia, sexual abuse, sexism, racism, suicide, grief, prostitution, and animal cruelty. Korine avoided any romantic notions regarding America, including its poor and mentally disabled.<ref name=\"cunha\"/><ref>Deussing, Ryan. Oct 1997. \"[http://www.harmony-korine.com/paper/int/hk/hkamerica.html Harmony Korine's America]\". Link. Retrieved 2009-11-09.</ref>\n\nKorine comments on the film's pop-aesthetic, saying: \"America is all about this recycling, this interpretation of pop. I want you to see these kids wearing [[Bone Thugs-n-Harmony|Bone Thugs & Harmony]] t-shirts and [[Metallica]] hats \u2013 this almost schizophrenic identification with popular imagery. If you think about, that's how people relate to each other these days, through these images.\"<ref name=\"kelly\"/> Dot and Helen are modeled after [[Cherie Currie]]. \"I wanted them to seem like homeschool kids... sort of guessing and coming up with these hipster things. They almost make a homeschool hip language. I wanted this inbred vernacular.\"<ref name=\"kelly\"/>\n\nThe film has a strong [[Vaudeville|vaudevillian]] influence. The name of the character Tummler is taken directly from the [[Tummler|vaudevillian term]] given to lower-level comics of the day. \"The guys that would check you into a hotel room, take your coat, and at the same time throw a few one-liners out. They're like the warm-up, the lowest level comedian. The tummler.\"<ref name=\"Walczak\"/> (See [[Borscht Belt]])\n\nRobin O'Hara argues that while people naturally look for points of reference to describe ''Gummo'' (such as [[Werner Herzog|Herzog]], [[John Cassavetes|Cassavetes]], [[Diane Arbus|Arbus]], [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]], [[Jean-Luc Godard|Godard]], [[Albert and David Maysles|Maysles]] and [[Derek Jarman|Jarman]]) that Korine's art really is his own. \"He is an original, in every sense of the word.\"<ref name=\"forward\"/> Korine comments on the film's aesthetic: \"We tried very hard not to reference other films. We wanted ''Gummo'' to set its own standard.\"<ref name=\"forward\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Gummo'' premiered at the 24th [[Telluride Film Festival]] on August 29, 1997.
