The film co-stars [[Diane Lane]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Fran Drescher]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Brian Kerwin]]. Williams plays the role of Jack Powell, a boy who ages four times faster than normal as a result of [[Werner syndrome]], a form of [[progeria]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins as Karen Powell goes into [[Childbirth|labor]] during a costume party and is rushed to the hospital by her husband, Brian, and their friends. Although the delivery is successful, the baby is extremely [[Premature birth|premature]], born after only ten weeks of pregnancy. Strangely, the infant seems to be a normal, healthy, full-term baby. After examinations and tests, the infant, now named Jack, is found to have an exaggerated form of [[Werner syndrome]]. Dr. Benfante and Dr. Lin diagnose a very rare autosomal recessive disorder. Their prognosis is that Jack will develop and age at a rate four times as fast as an average child, rendering him \"sick as frick\" as Dr. Lin explains colloquially.\n\nJack is next seen ten years later as a ten-year-old boy in the body of a forty-year-old man. Four boys lurk outside his house, swapping rumors of a \"monstrosity\" of a boy their age who cannot go to [[State school|school]]. He scares them away by dipping a [[Madballs|fake eye]] into slime and throwing it at them from his window. He is extremely childish due to his secluded life. He has only socialized with his parents and his [[tutor]], Lawrence Woodruff, who introduces the idea that he should go to public school. His parents initially balk, for fear Jack could be emotionally traumatized.\n\nWhen he first attends school, he is cast away by several kids since he looks like a 40-year-old man. His dad later gives him some encouragement by installing a basketball hoop to help him learn to fit in. At school the following days, Louis picks him for his team to play [[basketball]] with some bullies and they win the game. After school, Louis asks Jack to help him by pretending to be the school principal to help him avoid reprimand from his mom Dolores. Afterwards, they become friends and Louis invites him to a clubhouse with other kids, eventually enlisting him to get [[pornography|adult magazines]] and other such adult items for his group of friends. Jack attempts to be a normal kid, but when he deals with his first crush, and the heartbreak of confessing it to his teacher, Miss Marquez, he falls down a flight of stairs while attempting to leave, and is rushed to the hospital. His doctor explains that he suffered a shocking severe strain (which could've been a rare form of [[angina]]), and that, because of his Werner syndrome, his internal clock is starting to run out. Realizing the dangers it might entail for his health, his parents decide to withdraw him from school, which upsets him.\n\nHe sneaks out of the house and goes to a bar, where he gets drunk and befriends a man named Paulie, and tries to hit on Dolores. However, he gets into a fight with a bully and both are arrested. Dolores bails Jack out, and comforts Jack after dropping him off home. Upon returning home, he locks himself in his room and doesn't go out for weeks. Karen speculates that perhaps he realized the fragility of his life and is now scared of facing the outside world again. He also doubts the need to study as he realizes that he wouldn't have the time to use any of the knowledge.\n\nMeanwhile, his friends continue coming to his house, hoping that he will come out and play, but he refuses. Finally, Louis has an idea: he brings the entire class over as they take turns yelling \"Can Jack come out and play?\" and participate in various games and fun activities right in front of the yard. The next day he decides to go back to school.\n\nSeven years later, an elderly-looking Jack and his four best friends are at their [[high school]] graduation. He delivers the valedictory speech, in which he reminds his classmates that life is short, and urges them to \"make your life spectacular,\" as the five of them drive off into the future.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Jack Powell\n* [[Diane Lane]] as Karen Powell\n* [[Brian Kerwin]] as Brian Powell\n* [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Miss Marquez\n* [[Bill Cosby]] as Lawrence Woodruff\n* [[Fran Drescher]] as Dolores Durante\n* [[Adam Zolotin]] as Louis Durante\n* [[Todd Bosley]] as Eddie\n* Seth Smith as John-John\n* Mario Yedidia as George\n* [[Michael McKean]] as Paulie\n* [[Allan Rich]] as Dr. Benfante\n* [[Keone Young]] as Dr. Lin\n* [[Jurnee Smollett]] as Phoebe\n* Allison Whitbeck as Lucy\n* [[Dwight Hicks]] as High School Principal\n* [[Marc Coppola (actor)|Mark Coppola]] as Radio Personality (voice)\n* Al Nalbandian as Principal McGee\n\n==Production==\n[[John Travolta]] was interested in playing the lead role of Jack but due to an \"apology\" deal with Robin Williams over royalties from ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', Williams was guaranteed the role.<ref name=\"TravoltaTime\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1995/more/news/travolta-time-99124422/|title=Travolta Time|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=July 19, 2021|archive-date=July 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210720050129/https://variety.com/1995/more/news/travolta-time-99124422/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Jack'' debuted at #1 and grossed roughly $58.6 million on a budget of $45 million.<ref name=mojo/>\n\n==Reception==\n''Jack'' received negative reviews.
