The film, written by William Osborne and [[Michael McCullers]], was released on 20 July 2004 in the United Kingdom and 30 July 2004 in the United States.\n\nThe film's plot concerns the [[Hood (Thunderbirds)|Hood]], who traps International Rescue (IR) leader [[Jeff Tracy]] and four of his sons on board the damaged ''[[Thunderbird 5]]'' to steal the other ''Thunderbirds'' vehicles and commit heists that IR will be blamed for, prompting Jeff's youngest son [[Alan Tracy|Alan]] and his friends [[Tin-Tin Kyrano|Tin-Tin]] and Fermat to stop him. In contrast with the original TV series, which used a combination of puppetry and scale-model special effects dubbed \"[[Supermarionation]]\", this film was made in [[live action]] with [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects.\n\nThe film received negative reviews from critics, who disparaged its wooden characters and thin plot, and was a [[box office bomb]]. Gerry Anderson was also negative about the film, describing it as \"the biggest load of crap I have ever seen in my entire life\",<ref name=Gerry /> although Sylvia Anderson praised it as a \"great tribute\" to the series.<ref name=Sylvia /> The film's soundtrack includes the song \"[[Thunderbirds / 3AM|Thunderbirds Are Go]]\" by pop-rock band [[Busted (band)|Busted]], which peaked at number one in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK charts]] and later won the 2004 UK [[The Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] award.\n\n==Plot==\nThe Tracy family, led by former [[astronaut]] [[Jeff Tracy]], operate International Rescue (IR), a secret organization that aids those in need during [[disasters]] using technologically advanced machines called [[Thunderbirds machines|Thunderbirds]], operating out of [[Tracy Island]] in the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]]. Youngest son [[Alan Tracy|Alan]] lives at a [[boarding school]] in [[Massachusetts]] and dreams of being a Thunderbird pilot. He and his best friend Fermat Hackenbacker, son of the Thunderbirds\u2019 engineer [[Brains (Thunderbirds)|Brains]], are extracted by [[Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward]], an IR agent, and her butler [[Aloysius Parker]], using her limo [[FAB 1]], as the Thunderbirds return from an [[oil platform|oil rig]] fire off the [[Russia]]n coast. Unbeknownst to them, the [[Hood (Thunderbirds)|Hood]], a [[psychokinesis|psychic]] criminal mastermind who has a vendetta against Jeff for abandoning him in a collapsing illegal diamond mine when his brother [[Kyrano]] was rescued, has planted a tracking beacon on the hull of ''[[Thunderbird 1]]''.\n\nThe Hood's [[submarine]] locates Tracy Island and fires a missile at the orbiting ''[[Thunderbird 5]]'', sending Jeff and older sons Scott, Virgil and Gordon in ''Thunderbird 3'' to rescue [[John Tracy (Thunderbirds)|John Tracy]]. The Hood and his minions, led by Mullion and Transom, take over the island's command centre, imprisoning the Tracys in ''Thunderbird 5'' as their oxygen runs out. The Hood reveals that he plans to use the ''Thunderbirds'' to rob ten of the major banks of the world, thus plunging the world's monetary system into chaos. The IR organization will be blamed and disgraced for it. Alan, Fermat and their friend [[Tin-Tin Kyrano|Tin-Tin]], Kyrano's daughter and Alan's crush, use a ventilation shaft to reach the Thunderbird silos. Fermat removes ''[[Thunderbird 2]]''{{-'}}s guidance chip, delaying the Hood's plan, and the teenagers flee into the island's [[jungle]].\n\nWhile traversing the jungle to find the island's remote transmitter, Tin-Tin displays psychic powers like her uncle. Alan insists on confronting the villains, but Jeff tells them to wait for Lady Penelope's arrival. The trio flees from Mullion and his men, but Fermat and Tin-Tin are captured when Alan tries to tow them to safety on hovercraft, after their riding compartment falls off. Lady Penelope and Parker arrive, engaging the Hood's minions in combat, but the Hood defeats them with his powers. When Alan appears, the Hood forces him to give up the guidance chip and locks him and the others in the compound's walk-in freezer. The Hood, Mullion, and Transom pilot ''Thunderbird 2'' to [[London]] and use the [[Thunderbird 2 pod vehicles#The Mole|Mole]] to sink a [[monorail]] line into the [[Thames]] and drill into the [[Bank of England]]\u2019s vaults. Alan and company escape and contact Jeff and his older sons, who regain control ''Thunderbird 5''. While the adults set out to stop the Hood, the teenagers and Lady Penelope fly to London in ''Thunderbird 1''.\n\nArriving in London, Alan and Tin-Tin rescue a submerged monorail car using the aquatic ''[[Thunderbird 4]]'' before pursuing the Hood. Together, Fermat, Tin-Tin, and Parker defeat the Hood's henchmen. The Hood locks Jeff and Lady Penelope in a vault and challenges Alan to defeat him. Alan dangles from a catwalk over the Mole, but Tin-Tin appears, using her own powers to defeat the Hood. The Hood taunts Alan to let him die as his father did, but Alan, knowing that his father had in fact tried unsuccessfully to save the Hood, rescues him despite what he had done to them. The Hood and his minions are arrested, and International Rescue return to their island. Alan, Fermat, and Tin-Tin are inducted as official members of IR, and depart for their first mission.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Brady Corbet]] as [[Alan Tracy]], the 14-year-old main protagonist\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as [[Jeff Tracy]], the widowed father of Alan and his brothers\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as the [[Hood (Thunderbirds)|Hood]], Kyrano's half-brother, Tin-Tin's uncle, the movie's main antagonist\n* [[Vanessa Hudgens]] as [[Tin-Tin Kyrano|Tin-Tin]] Belagant, Alan's crush\n* Soren Fulton as Fermat Hackenbacker, Alan's best friend\n* [[Sophia Myles]] as [[Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward]], International Rescue's London agent\n* [[Ron Cook]] as [[Aloysius Parker]], Lady Penelope's butler/chauffeur\n* [[Anthony Edwards (actor)|Anthony Edwards]] as [[Brains (Thunderbirds)|Ray \"Brains\" Hackenbacker]], the engineer who created the Thunderbirds, Fermat's father\n* [[Philip Winchester]] as [[Scott Tracy]], Alan's oldest brother, aged 24, pilot of Thunderbird 1\n* [[Lex Shrapnel]] as [[John Tracy (Thunderbirds)|John Tracy]], Alan's kind-hearted second oldest brother, aged 22, space monitor of Thunderbird 5\n* [[Dominic Colenso]] as [[Virgil Tracy]], Alan's third oldest brother, aged 20, pilot of Thunderbird 2\n* Ben Torgersen as [[Gordon Tracy]], Alan's fourth oldest brother, aged 18, astronaut of Thunderbird 3\n* Bhasker Patel as [[Kyrano]] Belagant, Jeff's retainer and Tin-Tin's father\n* [[Harvey Virdi]] as Onaha, Tin-Tin's mother\n* [[Deobia Oparei]] as Mullion, one of the Hood's goons, a martial arts expert\n* [[Rose Keegan]] as Transom, one of the Hood's goons, who has a crush on Brains\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''Thunderbirds'' was the third theatrical release based upon the series created by [[Gerry Anderson|Gerry]] and [[Sylvia Anderson]]. It was preceded by ''[[Thunderbirds Are Go]]'' in 1966 and ''[[Thunderbird 6]]'' in 1968, both films using the Supermarionation production techniques of the series.\n\nProduction of the film started in the mid-1990s when [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]] purchased the rights to the entire ITC Entertainment library, which included the original Thunderbirds series. Seeing the big-screen potential of the series, [[Peter Hewitt (director)|Peter Hewitt]] was signed on to direct, while [[Karey Kirkpatrick]] was signed on to write. While Hewitt was a lifelong fan of the series, Kirkpatrick was not, but watched all 32 episodes of the original series to immerse himself within the lore of the series.<ref name=arentGo>{{cite web |url=http://groovyfokker.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/thunderbirds-arent-go-unfilmed-versions.html |title=Thunderbirds Aren't Go!|access-date=29 March 2015}}</ref> Hewitt and Kirkpatrick wrote a draft of the screenplay which was faithful to the series, but which they hoped would not alienate audiences who were unfamiliar with the franchise. Their script featured The Hood trying to steal Tracy Island's power core to power a device controlled by arch villain Thaddeus Stone, which would transfer all of Earth's gravity to the moon. After four drafts, Kirkpatrick left the project due to [[Working Title]]'s concerns that the film would not play well in the US market. (Working Title was the unit of PolyGram, and later [[Universal Studios]] when that company in 1999 bought out PolyGram's assets, that produced films in Britain.) Hewitt also left the production shortly afterwards due to his dislike for the new direction the film was taking.<ref name=arentGo/>\n\nHewitt was replaced by [[Jonathan Frakes]], whose credentials included another film in the science fiction family film genres, ''[[Clockstoppers]]''. [[Ben Kingsley]] accepted the part of the Hood because his children were ''Thunderbirds'' fans and, having just finished with ''[[House of Sand and Fog (film)|House of Sand and Fog]]'', he was ready for a more lighthearted role.<ref>{{cite web |last=Morales |first=Wilson |title=Thunderbirds Press Conference: An Interview with Jonathan Frakes, Brady Corbet, Vanessa Anne Hudgens, and Soren Fulton |url=http://www.blackfilm.com/20040723/features/thunderbirdspress.shtml |website=Black Film.com |access-date=28 May 2021 |date=July 2004}}</ref>\n\nFilming began in March 2003 in Seychelles, before moving to [[Pinewood Studios]] and on-location shooting in London.\n\n''Thunderbirds'' is dedicated to the memory of Stephen Lowen, a rigger on the film, who died in a fall whilst dismantling one of the sets.<ref>{{cite web |first=Agnes |last=McPhilemy |url=http://www.borehamwoodtimes.co.uk/news/383366.0/|title=Ex-Para Dies After 16ft Fall |work=Borehamwood Times |date=18 June 2003 |access-date=5 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Theatrical release and home media==\n\n''Thunderbirds'' was theatrically released on 24 July 2004 in the United Kingdom and 30 July 2004 in the United States by [[Universal Studios]], and was released on VHS & DVD on 21 December 2004 by [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]].\n\n''Thunderbirds'' was re-released on Blu-Ray in the United Kingdom by [[Universal Studios]], and by [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] on 7 October 2019.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:FAB 1 Thunderbirds car 2004.jpg|thumb|The FAB 1 car designed by [[Ford of Europe]] for the film]]\n\n===Box office===\n''Thunderbirds'' grossed $28,283,637 worldwide, and with an estimated $57 million budget,<ref>{{cite web |title=Thunderbirds (2004) |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0167456/?ref_=bo_se_r_1 |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=26 May 2021}}</ref> the film was a [[box office bomb]]. Frakes attributed the film's box office failure to a combination of stiff competition from its contemporaries ''[[Shrek 2]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' and its poor critical reception.<ref>{{cite web |last=Marsh |first=Calum |title=Star Trek Legend Jonathan Frakes on Discovery, Movie Jail, and Life as an Actor's Director |url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/star-trek-jonathan-frakes-director-interview.html |website=[[Vulture (web site)|Vulture]] |access-date=26 May 2021 |date=24 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\n''Thunderbirds'' received negative reviews. Those familiar with the series tended to be more negative. Sukhdev Sandhu of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' called it \"a quite cretinous travesty of the original series\", saying that the film lacks the TV series's romantic approach to technology (particularly mentioning its rushed version of the countdown to the Thunderbirds takeoff) and suffers from thin plotting and dialogue. He also regarded the entire trend of making films based on decades-old TV series as good-intentioned but misguided, arguing, \"Those programmes can be seen on terrestrial and cable TV. They're available on DVD. They don't need reviving and updating.\"<ref name=TelegRev>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3621169/Thunderbirds-are-no-go.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Thunderbirds are no-go | first=Sukhdev | last=Sandhu | date=23 July 2004 | access-date=25 May 2010}}</ref> The ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''{{'}}s Amy Biancolli similarly called the film a \"rather breathtakingly misconceived attempt to revisit a vintage TV show that did not under any circumstances need to be revisited\". She found the central character Alan \"whiny and uninteresting\", the script poor, the plot contrived and unsatisfying, and the acting wooden, though she noted that her three children enjoyed it much more than she did. She gave it a C\u2212.<ref name=HoustonCRev>{{cite news |last=Biancolli |first=Amy |title=Thunderbirds |url=https://www.chron.com/entertainment/movies/article/Thunderbirds-1627981.php |access-date=25 May 2021 |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |date=30 July 2004}}</ref> [[Ian Freer]], writing for ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', assessed that the film fails to either evoke nostalgia in the generation which watched ''Thunderbirds'' as children or provide snappy entertainment for the current generation of children. Like Sandhu, he felt the countdown sequence was so rushed that there is no sense of occasion to a Thunderbird taking to the sky. He also said that the child leads lack spirit and chemistry, and the adult characters suffer from excessive exposition and flat characterization. While he did praise Sophia Myles's performance and the vehicle designs, he considered the film an overall failure and gave it two out of five stars.<ref name=EmpireRev>{{cite web |last=Freer |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Freer|title=Thunderbirds Review |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/thunderbirds-review/ |website=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |access-date=25 May 2021}}</ref> On the [[review aggregation]] site [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a 19% \"rotten\" rating based on 106 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"Live-action cartoon for kids.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Thunderbirds (2004) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/thunderbirds |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=25 May 2021}}</ref> Critics widely described the film as a second-rate ''[[Spy Kids]]'' imitator.<ref name=TelegRev/><ref name=HoustonCRev/><ref name=EmpireRev/>\n\nDuring development, creator [[Gerry Anderson]] was invited to act as [[creative consultant]], but was left out when the studio felt there were enough employees on the payroll acting as part of the creative team. The studio offered him $750,000 (\u00a3432,000) to attend the premiere but Anderson could not accept money from people he had not worked for. He eventually saw the film on DVD and was disappointed, declaring \"It was disgraceful that such a huge amount of money was spent with people who had no idea what ''Thunderbirds'' was about and what made it tick.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Talking Shop: Gerry Anderson|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=7 October 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7655589.stm|access-date=7 October 2008}}</ref> He also said that it was \"the biggest load of crap I have ever seen in my entire life\".<ref name=Gerry>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/07/gerry-anderson-thunderbirds-auction | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Gerry Anderson auctions Thunderbirds treasures | first=Caitlin | last=Fitzsimmons | date=7 February 2009 | access-date=25 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nCo-creator [[Sylvia Anderson]], and the one responsible for character development, was given a private screening of the film and attended the London premiere. She expressed a far different opinion to that of her former husband, stating \"I felt that I'd been on a wonderful ''Thunderbirds'' adventure. You, the fans, will I'm sure, appreciate the sensitive adaptation and I'm personally thrilled that the production team have paid us the great compliment of bringing to life our original concept for the big screen. If we had made it ourselves (and we have had over 30 years to do it!) we could not have improved on this new version.

The DVD versions of all three films include a number of extra features, including historical and production information.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}\n\n==Differences from the original==\n{{More citations needed|date=June 2013}}{{Original research section|date=May 2021}}\n\nChanges from the [[Thunderbirds (TV series)|original series]] include new designs for the Thunderbird craft, a new layout of Tracy Island, redesigned International Rescue uniforms, and the Hood and Tracy Island being referred to by name in dialogue (rather than just on merchandise). The organisation is also referred to as \"Thunderbirds\" in everyday use, although the official name is still International Rescue.\n\nIn the original series, Alan and Tin-Tin are much closer to the age of the rest of the Tracy brothers. Fermat Hackenbacker and Onaha are new characters not from the TV series, while Grandma Tracy has been omitted from the film.\n\nThe TV series has \"Kyrano\" as the family name, with Kyrano's first name never being revealed. Tin-Tin and Kyrano change nationality in the film; they are Malaysian in the TV series but are depicted as being from India in the film.\n\nIn the feature film, the Hood said that he was left for dead in one of International Rescue's earlier missions, but in \"Trapped in the Sky\"\u2014which was stated as International Rescue's first mission\u2014he was ''already'' trying to get their technology, the existence of which he knew via Kyrano.<ref group=\"e\">{{cite episode|title=[[Trapped in the Sky]] |series=Thunderbirds|credits=Written by [[Gerry Anderson|Gerry]] and [[Sylvia Anderson]].

One of the recurring \"rules\" in the original TV series was that under no circumstances was anything related to International Rescue\u2014be it the pilots or the craft themselves\u2014permitted to be photographed.
