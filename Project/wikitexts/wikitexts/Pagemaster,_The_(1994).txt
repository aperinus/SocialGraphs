The film was produced by [[Turner Pictures]] and [[Hanna-Barbera]] and released by [[20th Century Fox]] on November 23, 1994.<ref name=\"AFI\">{{cite web|title=The Pagemaster|url=https://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=60420|publisher=American Filme Institute|access-date=10 January 2017}}</ref> Culkin stars as a timid boy who uses statistics as an excuse to avoid anything he finds uncomfortable in life. But after reluctantly undertaking an errand for his father, he gets caught in a storm, which forces him to seek refuge in a library. He then finds himself trapped inside the library, where he must battle his way through literary classics come to life if he is to find his way home.\n\nThe film was written for the screen by David Casci,<ref>{{cite news|title= MOVIE REVIEW : 'Pagemaster' a Live-Action Adventure in World of Books\n|work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1994-11-23|url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-11-23-ca-538-story.html\n|access-date=2011-12-16|first=Peter|last=Rainer}}</ref> based on a six-page pitch by writer Charles Pogue entitled \"Library Days\", presented to Casci by producer [[David Kirschner]]. The film was directed by [[Joe Johnston]] (live-action) and [[Pixote Hunt]] and Glenn Chaika (animation), and produced by David Kirschner and Paul Gertz. The film received generally negative reviews from critics and grossed $13.7 million from a budget of $34 million.  The film's poor box office performance, along with ''[[Cats Don't Dance]]'' (1997), set back other animated films for the animation studio, [[Turner Feature Animation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2012/08/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-brad-birds-the-iron-giant-107519/|title=5 Things You Might Not Know About Brad Bird's 'The Iron Giant'|last=Lyttelton|first=Oliver|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=2012-08-06|access-date=2019-10-05}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nPessimistic 10-year-old Richard Tyler lives life based on statistics and fears everything. His exasperated parents have tried multiple ways to build up his courage to little success. Richard is sent to buy a bag of nails for building a [[treehouse]]. However, Richard gets caught in a harsh thunderstorm and takes shelter in a library. He meets Mr. Dewey, an eccentric librarian/custodian who insists that he is in need of a special book and gives him a library card, despite Richard's protests. Searching for a phone, Richard finds a large [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] painted with many famous literary characters. He slips on water dripping from his coat and falls over, knocking himself out. Richard awakens to find the rotunda art melting, which washes over him and the library, turning them into illustrations.\n\nHe is met by the Pagemaster, the mythical Keeper of Books and Guardian of the Written Word. Richard asks for directions to the exit, so the Pagemaster sends him through the fiction section toward the green neon exit sign. Along the way, Richard befriends three [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] books: Adventure, a swashbuckling pirate-like book; Fantasy, a sassy but caring fairy-tale book; and Horror, a fearful \"Hunchbook\" with a misshapen spine. The three agree to help Richard if he checks them out using his new library card. Together, the quartet encounters classic-fictional characters. They meet [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll]] who turns into Mr. Hyde, driving them to the open waters of the Land of Adventure. However, the group is separated after [[Moby Dick (whale)|Moby-Dick]] attacks, following the whale's battle with [[Captain Ahab]]. Richard and Adventure are shipwrecked and picked up by the ''Hispaniola'', captained by [[Long John Silver]]. The pirates go to [[Treasure Island]], but find no treasure except for one gold coin, nearly causing a mutiny between the captain and the crew. Fantasy and Horror return and defeat the pirates. Silver attempts to convince Richard to leave with him but surrenders when Richard threatens him with a sword.\n\nIn the fantasy section, Richard sees the exit sign on the top of a mountain. However, Adventure's bumbling awakens a dormant [[dragon]]. Richard tries to fight the dragon with a sword and shield, but the dragon swallows him. Richard finds books in the dragon's stomach and uses a beanstalk from ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' to escape through the dragon's mouth. He and the books climb the beanstalk to reach the exit. They enter a large dark room where the Pagemaster awaits them. Richard accuses the Pagemaster of causing the horrors that he suffered, but the Pagemaster reveals the journey was intended to make Richard face his fears. Dr. Jekyll, Captain Ahab, Long John Silver, and the dragon reappear in a magical twister and congratulate him. The Pagemaster swoops Richard and the books into the twister, sending them back to the real world.\n\nRichard awakens, finding Adventure, Fantasy, and Horror lying next to him as real books. Mr. Dewey finds him, and, even though the library policy only allows a person to check out two books at a time, lets him check out all three books \"just this once\".\n\nRichard returns home a braver boy, sleeping in his new treehouse with his books.\n\n== Cast ==\n=== Live-action ===\n* [[Macaulay Culkin]] as Richard Tyler, a young 10-year-old boy who seems to have a fear of everything and runs his life based on safety statistics. Culkin is the only actor in the film to portray his character in both live-action and animation.\n* [[Christopher Lloyd]] as Mr. Dewey, the unconventional librarian and caretaker of a seemingly abandoned library\n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]] and [[Mel Harris]] as Alan and Claire Tyler, Richard's supportive parents. Alan considers himself a bad father due to his continuous failed attempts to help Richard get over his fears.\n* Jessica Kirschner, Brandon S. McKay, Alexis Kirschner, Guy Mansker, and Stephen Sheehan as the neighborhood kids. They make fun of Richard, who ignores them.\n\n=== Voice cast ===\n* [[Christopher Lloyd]] as the Pagemaster, the Keeper of the Books and Guardian of the Written Word. He is implied to be Mr. Dewey's alternate form.\n* [[Patrick Stewart]] as Adventure, a swashbuckling gold [[adventure fiction]] book resembling a stereotypical [[piracy|pirate]] with an eyepatch, a hook, and a peg leg.\n* [[Whoopi Goldberg]] as Fantasy, a [[fairy]]-styled lavender [[Fairy tale|fairy-tale]] book. She can be opprobrious, aggressive, and hotheaded.\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Horror, a turquoise [[horror fiction]] book with a resemblance to [[Igor (character)|Igor]]. Despite his name, he is quite the opposite of horrific.\n** Welker also provides the sound effects of the [[dragon]], [[Moby Dick (whale)|Moby Dick]], and the other creatures.\n* [[Leonard Nimoy]] as [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]], the [[mad scientist]] who turned into the horrific monster.\n* [[George Hearn]] as [[Captain Ahab]], an almost [[Psychosis|psychotic]] whale hunter who is out to kill the white whale Moby Dick.\n* [[Jim Cummings]] as [[Long John Silver]], the ruthless usurper Captain of the ''Hispaniola''.\n* [[Phil Hartman]] as Tom Morgan, a slender and violent pirate on the ''Hispaniola''.\n* [[Ed Gilbert]] as George Merry, an [[Obesity|obese]] pirate on the ''Hispaniola''.\n* [[B. J. Ward (actress)|B.J. Ward]] as the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]], the [[Tyrant|tyrannical]] ruler of [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Wonderland]] who appears in the ''Alice in Wonderland'' book in the dragon's stomach.\n\nThe Pirates of the ''Hispaniola'' are voiced by [[Richard Erdman]], Fernando Escandon, [[Dorian Harewood]], and [[Robert Picardo]].\n\n== Production ==\nThe animation in the film was produced by [[Turner Feature Animation]],<ref name=filmcartoons/> headed by [[David Kirschner]] and supervising animator [[Bruce W. Smith]] and recently spun off from [[Hanna-Barbera]]. The crew included animators who were veterans of productions such as ''[[An American Tail]]'' (1986) (also produced by David Kirschner and composed by [[James Horner]]), ''[[The Land Before Time (film)|The Land Before Time]]'' (1988). This was one of the first films to feature live-action, traditional animation, and CGI animation all together. One scene involving a computer-generated dragon made from paint was used, a challenge for the filmmakers. All of the fictional works featured in the film were created and first published before January 1, 1923, making them a part of the [[public domain]] in most countries. The theme songs to the movie are \"[[Dream Away (Babyface and Lisa Stansfield song)|Dream Away]]\", sung by [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]] and [[Lisa Stansfield]], and \"Whatever You Imagine\", sung by [[Wendy Moten]].\n\nAccording to the film's animation crew, the film went overbudget during animation production due to mismanagement and changes to the narrative.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} [[Joe Johnston]] went on to express his dissatisfaction over the production, claiming that the film was re-edited without his consent. He has since crossed ''The Pagemaster'' off his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAdXnjYgz9U |title=YouTube |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=2020-01-26 |archive-date=2020-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222104715/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAdXnjYgz9U&gl=US&hl=en |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{Dead link|date=September 2022}}\n\nThis was also the third film in which [[Leonard Nimoy]] and [[Frank Welker]] co-starred; the first two were ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]'' and ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''. The two later co-starred again, 17 years later, in ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]''. Nimoy, along with David Kirschner, were also involved in Hanna-Barbera's 1993 feature-length [[The Halloween Tree (film)|animated television film adaptation]] of [[Ray Bradbury]]'s 1972 fantasy novel, ''[[The Halloween Tree]]'', in which Nimoy was the voice of Carapace Clavicle Moundshroud.\n\n=== Legal issue ===\nThe screenwriting credits for this film were the subject of a protracted [[Arbitration|legal arbitration]] with the [[WGA screenwriting credit system|Writers Guild of America (WGA)]]<ref>WGAw official case # 94SR002</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Morning Report|work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1997-12-13|url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-dec-13-ca-63480-story.html|access-date=2011-12-16|first=Shauna|last=Snow}}</ref> when its producer, [[David Kirschner]], attempted to claim sole authorship of the screenplay and original story, with no credit for its original screenwriter, David Casci. Typically, proposed credits are submitted to the WGA for approval well in advance of the release of a film or the publishing of posters or novelizations on which writing credits appear. In the case of ''The Pagemaster'', the producers attempted to claim that, as the film was now largely animated, the WGA did not have jurisdiction to determine credits. Casci had written the screenplay under a WGA contract, as well as previous live-action versions for [[Walt Disney Television|Disney Television]] dating back to 1985, also written under WGA contract. These facts positioned the WGA to get involved, testing their tenuous authority over a feature film with animated elements.\n\nAfter a lengthy investigation and interviews with those intimately familiar with the genesis of the ''Pagemaster'' project, including three persons within Kirschner's own office, the WGA credit arbitration process determined that David Casci was, in fact, the primary writer, and that Kirschner did not provide a sufficient creative contribution to the writing process to warrant any screenwriting credit. Upon receiving this determination by the WGA, Fox threatened to pull out of arbitration and release the film without WGA-approved credits, positioning the WGA to be forced to file an injunction blocking the film's heavily promoted Christmas season release.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nUltimately, a settlement was reached, and Fox released the film with both Kirschner and Casci receiving story and screenplay credit, with a third writer, Ernie Contreras, also receiving screenplay credit.\n\nAt the time, this case was the most expensive and extensive investigation of its type undertaken by the WGA on behalf of one of its members.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n=== Extended and deleted scenes ===\n''The Pagemaster'' is presented in an extended cut version. During the production, some original scenes were removed, both live-action and animation. The deleted scenes and characters can be still seen during the making of the film, trailers and TV spots, [[SkyBox International]] trading cards, books and other related products. They can be also seen during the sneak peek on the 1993 VHS release of ''[[Once Upon a Forest]]'', the 1994 VHS release of ''[[Rookie of the Year (film)|Rookie of the Year]]'', and in the promotional trailer of the VHS release of the film on the promotional demo/screener VHS copy in 1995.\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was a production by Turner Pictures.

The soundtrack not only had the movie's score on it, but it also had two songs and one of which was heard during the film's end credits and they were performed by successful and well-known recording artists. The songs were titled \"Whatever You Imagine\" by [[Wendy Moten]] which was heard during the film when all four characters finally enter into the fantasy section and \"Dream Away\" by [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]] and [[Lisa Stansfield]] is heard during the end credits. The soundtrack album was released only on Compact Disc and Cassette Tape format on October 30, 1994 and it's also available in the iTunes Store. The release date that's displayed in the iTunes Store for the soundtrack album, however is completely incorrect.\n\n== Book adaptations ==\nContrary to any claims, the screenplay and film are not based on any book. David Casci's screenplay preceded all novelizations and illustrated books by several years.\n\nA number of books based on the film exist, including an illustrated book attributed to David Kirschner and Ernie Contreras, illustrated by Jerry Tiritilli, which contained large passages from the Casci screenplay without giving Casci writing credit. The film was well into production by the time this book was introduced in the 1993 F. A. O. Schwarz Christmas Catalog. Other properties based on the film include a novelization of the film, children's story books, pop-up books and other film ancillaries such as toys and games.\n\n== Video game ==\n{{Main|The Pagemaster (video game)}}\nVideo game adaptations of the film were released the same year as the film.
