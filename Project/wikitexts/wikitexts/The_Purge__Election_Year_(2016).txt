Eighteen years later, in 2040, Roan is a [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] running for President and promising to end the Purge nights. Former police sergeant [[Leo Barnes]] is now head of security for Roan. The New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) and their candidate, Minister Edwidge Owens, view Roan as a threat and decide to revoke immunity on government officials during the Purge.\n\nWatching the Senator's TV debate are deli owner Joe Dixon, his assistant Marcos, and [[Emergency Medical Technician]] Laney Rucker. A pair of teenage girls enter the store and begin stealing, only to be stopped by Joe. The girls mock Joe until Laney steps in, at which point they surrender their stolen goods and leave. A phone call for Joe reveals that his insurance premiums for Purge coverage have been raised beyond his affordability. Meanwhile, more tourists visit the US to join the Purge.\n\nOn the night of the Purge, Joe guards his store and is joined by Marcos, and together they manage to repel an attack by the teenage girls. Laney travels the city providing medical care to the wounded. Roan decides to wait out the Purge from her home rather than a secure location in order to secure the vote, and is accompanied by Barnes, Chief Couper, Eric and additional security forces. However, they are betrayed by Couper and Eric, who allow a paramilitary force led by Earl Danzinger to kill the security detail. Barnes escorts the Senator to safety, but is wounded in the process. He detonates a bomb in the house, killing Eric and Chief Couper.\n\nBarnes and Roan attempt to seek shelter but are ambushed by a group of Purgers and taken captive. Before they are executed, Joe and Marcos shoot the gang dead, having seen the pair's plight from the store's rooftop. As they take shelter in Joe's store, the teenage girls return with reinforcements but are rescued by Laney, who kills the girls. The group are then ambushed by Danzinger in a helicopter, and seek refuge in an overpass where Barnes realizes they were tracked by the bullet lodged inside him, and manages to extract it as they are met by the [[Crips]]. In exchange for the group rendering medical aid to an injured Crips member, the gang plants the bullet elsewhere to divert the paramilitary team.\n\nThe group arrives at an underground anti-Purge hideout run by Dante Bishop. Barnes discovers that Bishop's group intends on assassinating Owens, in an effort to put an end to the Purge. A large group of paramilitary personnel arrive at the hideout looking for Bishop.  Barnes and Roan escape back to the streets and meet up with Joe, Marcos and Laney, who had left the hideout earlier to return to Joe's store.\n\nWhile fleeing the city, the ambulance is hit by Danzinger's team and Roan is pulled out before Barnes can assist. He leads the group and Bishop's team to a fortified cathedral where the NFFA plans to sacrifice her. Before Roan can be killed by the NFFA, the group arrives and cause a massive shootout that kills the congregation except Owens and NFFA loyalist Harmon James, who both escape. Owens is caught by Bishop's group who still intends on killing him but Roan is able to persuade them not to. The remaining paramilitary forces arrive, killing Bishop and his men. Danzinger fights Barnes, wherein the latter gains the upper hand. As Roan's group frees Owen's victims, James emerges from hiding and kills one of the victims but is shot by Joe in a crossfire, who later succumbs to his injuries.\n\nTwo months later, Marcos and Laney renovate Joe's store as they watch a television announcement declaring Roan's landslide victory. Another news report states of violent uprisings across the country from NFFA supporters in response to the election results.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Frank Grillo]] as [[Leo Barnes]],<ref name=\"GrilloCast\"/> former [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Police Sergeant turned Security Chief for Charlie Roan\n*[[Elizabeth Mitchell]] as Senator Charlene \"Charlie\" Roan,<ref name=\"Sep2015Deadline\"/> U.S. Senator/presidential candidate running on an anti-Purge platform\n**Christy Coco as Young Charlie Roan\n*[[Mykelti Williamson]]<ref name=\"Sep2015Deadline\"/> as Joe Dixon, a working class deli owner\n*[[Joseph Julian Soria]]<ref name=\"Sep2015Deadline\"/> as Marcos Dali, Joe's Hispanic employee and close friend\n*[[Betty Gabriel]]<ref name=\"Sep2015Deadline\"/> as Laney Rucker, a [[triage]] EMT and former purger \"la peque\u00f1a muerte\"\n*[[Terry Serpico]] as Earl Danzinger, leader of a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] paramilitary group\n*[[Edwin Hodge]] as Dante Bishop, an anti-Purge resistance fighter from the previous ''Purge'' films\n*[[Kyle Secor]] as Minister Edwidge Owens,<ref name=\"Sep2015Deadline\"/> a [[pastor]] of an NFFA-affiliated cathedral and presidential candidate\n*[[Barry Nolan]] as Reporter #1\n*[[Liza Col\u00f3n-Zayas]] as Dawn, Laney's friend<ref name=\"Sep2015Deadline\"/>\n*[[Ethan Phillips]] as Chief Couper, member of Roan's security team and mole\n*Adam Cantor as Tall Eric Busmalis, member of Roan's security team and mole\n*[[Christopher James Baker]] as Harmon James, an NFFA loyalist\n*Jared Kemp as Rondo, a young injured purger\n*Brittany Mirabil\u00e9 as Kimmy, a schoolgirl purger\n*[[Raymond J.
