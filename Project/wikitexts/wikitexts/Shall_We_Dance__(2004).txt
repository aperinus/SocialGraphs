Despite the Briefcase|first=Stephen|last=Holden|date=October 15, 2004|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/15/movies/15shal.html?_r=0}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJohn Clark is a [[lawyer]] with a charming wife, Beverly, and a loving family, who nevertheless feels that [[ennui|something is missing]] as he makes his way every day through the city. Each evening on his commute home through [[Chicago]], John sees a beautiful woman staring with a lost expression through the window of a dance studio. Haunted by her gaze, John impulsively jumps off the train one night, and signs up for [[ballroom dancing]] lessons, hoping to meet her.\n\nAt first, it seems like a mistake. His teacher turns out not to be the woman in the window, Paulina, but the studio's older namesake, Miss Mitzi, and John proves to be just as clumsy as his equally clueless classmates Chic and Vern on the dance-floor. Even worse, when he does meet Paulina, she icily tells John she hopes he has come to the studio to seriously study dance and not to look for a date. But, as his lessons continue, John falls in love with dancing. Keeping his new obsession from his family and co-workers, John feverishly trains for Chicago's biggest dance competition. His friendship with Paulina blossoms, as his enthusiasm rekindles her own lost passion for dance. But the more time John spends away from home, the more his wife Beverly becomes suspicious. She hires a [[private investigator]] to find out what John is doing, but when she finds out the truth, she chooses to discontinue the investigation and not invade her husband's privacy.\n\nJohn is partnered with Bobbie for the competition, although his friend Link steps in to do the [[Latin dance]]s. Link and Bobbie do well in the Latin dances, and while John and Bobbie's waltz goes well, John sees his wife and daughter in the crowd during the quickstep, and is distracted by trying to find them. He and Bobbie fall and are disqualified, and John and Beverly argue in the parking garage. John quits dancing, to everyone's dismay.\n\nPaulina, having been inspired by John to take up competing again, is leaving to go to Europe, and is having a going-away party at the dance studio. She sends John an invitation, but he is not convinced to go until his wife leaves out a pair of dancing shoes that she bought him. He goes and meets Beverly at work, convinces her that while he loves dancing, he still loves her just as much, and he teaches her to dance. They go to the party, and John and Paulina have one last dance before she leaves.\n\nThe end scene shows everyone afterwards: Link and Bobbie are now together; Chic, who was actually gay, dances at a club with his partner; Miss Mitzi finds a new partner, and they are happy together; John and Beverly are happier than before and dance in the kitchen; Vern, newly married to his fianc\u00e9e, dances with her at their wedding; the private investigator that Beverly hired, Devine, starts up dance lessons; and Paulina, with a new partner, competes at the [[Blackpool Dance Festival]], the competition that she had lost the year before.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Richard Gere]] as John Clark\n* [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Paulina\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Beverly Clark\n* [[Lisa Ann Walter]] as Bobbie\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Link Peterson\n* [[Anita Gillette]] as Miss Mitzi\n* [[Bobby Cannavale]] as Chic\n* [[Omar Benson Miller|Omar Miller]] as Vern\n* [[Tamara Hope]] as Jenna Clark\n* [[Stark Sands]] as Evan Clark\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Devine\n* [[Nick Cannon]] as Scott\n* [[Karina Smirnoff]] as Link's Pouty Dance Partner\n* [[M\u00fda|M\u00fda Harrison]] as Vern's Fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Ja Rule]] as Hip-Hop Bar Performer\n* [[Tony Dovolani]] as Slick Willy\n* [[Cesar Corrales]] as Dancer\n* [[Slavik Kryklyvyy]] as Paulina's Pro Ballroom (finale)\n}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n# [[Sway (Luis Demetrio song)|\"Sway\"]] - [[The Pussycat Dolls]]\n# \"Santa Maria\" (Del Buen Ayre) - [[Gotan Project]]\n# \"Happy Feet\" - [[John Altman (composer)|John Altman]]\n# \"[[Espa\u00f1a ca\u00f1\u00ed]]\" - John Altman\n# \"I Wanna (Shall We Dance)\" - Gizelle D'Cole\n# \"[[Perfidia]]\" - John Altman\n# \"[[Under The Bridges Of Paris]]\" - John Altman\n# \"[[Moon River]]\" - John Altman\n# \"Andalucia\" - John Altman\n# \"[[The Book of Love (The Magnetic Fields song)#Peter Gabriel version|The Book Of Love]]\" - [[Peter Gabriel]]\n# \"The L Train\" - [[Gabriel Yared]]\n# \"[[I Could Have Danced All Night]]\" - [[Jamie Cullum]]\n# \"Wonderland\" - [[Rachel Fuller]]\n# \"Shall We Dance?\" - Gotan Project\n# [[Let's Dance (David Bowie song)|\"Let's Dance\"]] - [[M\u00fda]]\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\nThe film debuted on October 15, 2004, grossing $11,783,467 in the opening weekend, placing fourth at the North American box office.

The consensus states: \"The cast is warmly appealing, but with the loss of cultural context and addition of big-name celebrities, this American version loses the nuances of the original.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shall_we_dance/ | title = Shall We Dance | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher = [[Flixster]] }}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, stating \"I enjoyed the Japanese version so much I invited it to my Overlooked Film Festival a few years ago, but this remake offers pleasures of its own.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041014/REVIEWS/40921008/1023 Roger Ebert review]</ref>\n\n==Title==\nThe original Japanese film had a question mark in its title, and the publicity poster for this film also includes it. However, the actual film titles on the US film appear as simply \"Shall We Dance\", leading to some online sources, including [[IMDb]], referring to it without showing the question mark. The inclusion of the question mark serves to distinguish these two films from the 1937 Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film ''[[Shall We Dance (1937 film)|Shall We Dance]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.miramax.com/movie/shall-we-dance-2004}}\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{Mojo title}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n* {{AFI film}}\n* {{TCMDb title}}\n\n{{Peter Chelsom}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2004 romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s dance films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American dance films]]\n[[Category:American remakes of Japanese films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Ballroom dancing films]]\n[[Category:Comedy film remakes]]\n[[Category:Drama film remakes]]\n[[Category:Films about dance competitions]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Chelsom]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Gabriel Yared]]\n[[Category:Films set in Blackpool]]\n[[Category:Films set in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Winnipeg]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Audrey Wells]]\n[[Category:Romance film remakes]]"}]}}}}
