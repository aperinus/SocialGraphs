We use the most general category for the lead. --> based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Deadpool|of the same name]]. Distributed by [[20th Century Fox]], it is a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]] and the eighth installment overall. Directed by [[Tim Miller (director)|Tim Miller]] (in his feature directorial debut) and written by [[Rhett Reese]] and [[Paul Wernick]], it stars [[Ryan Reynolds]] in the title role alongside [[Morena Baccarin]], [[Ed Skrein]], [[T. J. Miller]], [[Gina Carano]], and [[Brianna Hildebrand]]. In the film, Wade Wilson hunts the man who gave him [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] abilities and a scarred physical appearance, becoming the [[antihero]] Deadpool.\n\nDevelopment of a Deadpool film starring Reynolds began in February 2004, before he played the character in ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' in 2009. Reese and Wernick were hired for a spinoff in 2010 and worked with Reynolds to adapt the character more faithfully (including his [[fourth wall]] breaking) after the portrayal in ''Wolverine'' was criticized. Miller was hired in 2011, marking his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]]. An enthusiastic response to leaked test footage he created with Reynolds led to a green-light from Fox in 2014. Additional casting began in early 2015, and filming took place in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], from March to May of that year. Several vendors provided visual effects for the film, ranging from the addition of blood and gore to the creation of the [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]] character [[Colossus (character)|Colossus]].\n\n''Deadpool'' was released in the United States on February 12, 2016, after an [[Marketing for Deadpool (film)|unconventional marketing campaign]]. The film achieved both financial and critical success. It earned over $782&nbsp;million against a $58&nbsp;million budget, becoming the [[2016 in film#Highest-grossing films|ninth-highest-grossing film of 2016]] and breaking numerous records, including the highest-grossing [[List of highest-grossing R-rated films|R-rated film]] at the time. Critics praised Reynolds' performance, the film's style and faithfulness to the comics, along with its action sequences, though some criticized the plot as formulaic and were divided on the film's adult humor. It [[List of accolades received by Deadpool (film)|received many awards and nominations]], including two [[Critics' Choice Movie Awards|Critics' Choice Awards]] and two [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nominations.\n\nA sequel, ''[[Deadpool 2]]'', was released in 2018 to comparable critical and commercial success. Following the [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney]], the character's film rights were returned to [[Marvel Studios]] alongside the [[X-Men]] and the [[Fantastic Four]]. ''[[Deadpool 3]]'', a third film starring Reynolds and [[Hugh Jackman]], which will integrate the character into the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), is scheduled for release on November 8, 2024 as the first film in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Six|Phase Six]] of the MCU.\n\n{{toc limit}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\n[[Wade Wilson (film character)|Wade Wilson]] is a dishonorably discharged [[special forces]] operative working as a freelance mercenary when he meets a prostitute named [[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|Vanessa]]. They become romantically involved, and a year later she accepts his marriage proposal. However, Wilson is later diagnosed with terminal cancer and he leaves Vanessa without warning so she will not have to watch him die.\n\nA mysterious recruiter approaches Wilson and offers him an experimental cure for his cancer. He is taken to a laboratory run by [[Ajax (Francis Fanny)|Ajax]] and [[Morlocks (comics)#Other groups|Angel Dust]], who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant genes]] in his body. They subject Wilson to days of torture to induce stress and trigger any mutation he may have, without success. When Wilson discovers Ajax's real name is Francis and mocks him for it, Ajax leaves Wilson in a [[hypobaric chamber]] that periodically takes him to the verge of asphyxiation over the weekend. This finally activates a regenerative healing factor that counteracts Wilson's cancer, but leaves him severely disfigured with burn-like scars over his entire body. He escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax, but relents when told that his disfigurement can be cured. In the chaos, Ajax subdues Wilson and leaves him for dead in the now-burning laboratory.\n\nWilson survives due to his new healing abilities and seeks out Vanessa. He does not reveal to her that he is alive out of fear that she will reject his new appearance. After consulting with his best friend [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]], Wilson decides to hunt down Ajax for the cure. He becomes a masked vigilante, adopting the name \"Deadpool\" (from Weasel picking him in a [[dead pool]]), and moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named [[Blind Al|Al]]. Over the course of the next year, he questions and murders many of Ajax's men until one, the recruiter, reveals Ajax's whereabouts. Deadpool ambushes Ajax and a convoy of his men on an expressway. He kills all of Ajax's men, subdues Ajax himself, and demands the cure, but the [[X-Men|X-Man]] [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and his trainee [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead]] interrupt him. Colossus attempts to convince Deadpool to mend his ways and join the X-Men, but Deadpool rudely turns him down. Taking advantage of this distraction, Ajax escapes and regroups with Angel Dust. The two of them then head to Weasel's bar, where Ajax learns of Vanessa.\n\nAjax kidnaps Vanessa and takes her to a decommissioned [[helicarrier]] in a scrapyard. Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him get her back. They battle Angel Dust and a group of Ajax's men while Deadpool fights his way to Ajax. During the battle, Negasonic accidentally destroys the equipment stabilizing the helicarrier. Deadpool protects Vanessa as the ship collapses all around them, while Colossus carries Negasonic and Angel Dust to safety. Ajax attacks Deadpool again, but is overpowered. He reveals there was never a cure to begin with and, despite Colossus's pleas, Deadpool kills him. However, Deadpool does promise Colossus that he will try to be more heroic moving forward. Though Vanessa is angry with Wilson for leaving her, she reconciles with him upon learning from him why he never came back to her.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Cast of Deadpool.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|(L-R) Tim Miller, Reynolds, Baccarin, T.J.

He is seen in the film on a [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]] [[People (magazine)#Sexiest Man Alive|Sexiest Man Alive]] cover.<ref name=\"YahooFeb2016\" /> A scene featuring [[Nathan Fillion]] as a bathroom attendant was cut, but was featured in the deleted scenes of the home media release.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Artisan Entertainment]] announced a deal with [[Marvel Entertainment]] in May 2000 to co-produce, finance, and distribute several films based on [[Marvel Comics]]' characters, including [[Deadpool]].<ref name=\"ArtisanDeal\" /> By February 2004, writer and director [[David S. Goyer]] and [[Ryan Reynolds]] were working on a Deadpool film at [[New Line Cinema]]. They had worked together on the Marvel film ''[[Blade: Trinity]]''.<ref name=\"GoyerConfirms\" /> Reynolds was interested in the part of Deadpool after learning that in the comics the character refers to his appearance as \"Ryan Reynolds crossed with a [[Shar Pei|Shar-Pei]]\".<ref name=\"ReynoldsSRMar2009\" /> New Line executive [[Jeff Katz]], who thought Reynolds was the only actor suitable for the role, championed the idea. However, there were rights issues with [[20th Century Fox]] and their [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' films]], and the project did not move forward.<ref name=\"DevelopmentBegins\" />\n\nBy March 2005, Reynolds learned that Fox had expressed interest in a film featuring Deadpool.<ref name=\"FoxInterest\" /> The character was set to make a cameo appearance in the 2009 film ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', with Reynolds cast in the part. His role was expanded during the film's production.<ref name=\"ReynoldsColliderMar2009\" /> Katz was an executive at Fox at that point, and said that ''Deadpool'' was \"nicely set up to be explored in his own way\" in a future film.<ref name=\"DevelopmentBegins\" /> The film's portrayal deviates from the original comic character, \"imbuing him with several superpowers and sewing his mouth shut\". Deadpool apparently dies in the film, though a [[post-credits scene]] showing him still alive was added to the film shortly before its release. After the successful opening weekend of ''Wolverine'', Fox officially began development on ''Deadpool'', with Reynolds attached to star and ''X-Men'' producer [[Lauren Shuler Donner]] involved. The spinoff was set to ignore the ''Wolverine'' version of Deadpool and return to the character's roots with a slapstick tone and a \"propensity to break the [[fourth wall]]\".<ref name=\"FoxSpinoff\" />\n\n[[Rhett Reese]] and [[Paul Wernick]] were hired to write the script in January 2010.<ref name=\"ReeseWernick\" /> Reynolds, who worked closely with them, said they were chosen because, \"Tonally, they got it. They just [understood ''Deadpool''] right off the bat.\"<ref name=\"ReynoldsMTVJan2010\" /> By that June, [[Robert Rodriguez]] had been asked to direct the film.<ref name=\"Rodriguez\" /> He confirmed this a month later, saying he had been sent a \"really good\" script and was considering taking on the project.<ref name=\"RodriguezScript\" /> By October he was no longer interested in it, and [[Adam Berg (director)|Adam Berg]] was being looked at to direct the film.<ref name=\"BergContender\" /> In April 2011, [[Tim Miller (director)|Tim Miller]] was hired after working on the visual effects for some of the ''X-Men'' films,<ref name=\"Miller2011\" /> in part because of his work creating animated short films. These included the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Award-winning]] ''Gopher Broke'' and a [[DC Universe Online]] trailer which was \"epic and cinematic, everything [Fox wanted] their comic book movies to be\".<ref name=\"THRHistory\" /><ref name=\"MillerOscar\" /> Miller would make his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] with the film, while Reynolds closed a deal with Fox to produce the film.<ref name=\"Miller2011\" />\n\nReynolds' ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]'' superhero film was released later in 2011 and was \"a disaster\". This tainted the ''Deadpool'' project. Fox executives were already concerned about its R-rated content. After several meetings the studio agreed the film could not be reconfigured for a more traditional PG-13 rating, and gave Miller \"a low-six-figure budget\" to produce some test footage.<ref name=\"THRHistory\" /> He created the footage using CGI at his animation company [[Blur Studio]] in 2012, with Reynolds voicing Deadpool.<ref name=\"LeakedOfficial\" /> The footage did not convince Fox to green-light the film.<ref name=\"THRHistory\" /> After the successful May release of [[Marvel Studios]]'s ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', Reese and Wernick thought ''Deadpool'' might be approved as an already developed superhero film. Fox was actually even more doubtful about the script, however, and began exploring ways to include Deadpool in an ''Avengers''-esque team-up film.<ref name=\"ReeseWernickDoGFeb2016\" /> At different times during development, [[James Cameron]] and [[David Fincher]], both friends of Miller, read the film's script and championed the project to Fox executives.<ref name=\"ReeseWernickColliderNov2016\" />\n\n{{Quote box|width=30%|quote=\"I would have [leaked the test footage], if I had known it would have caused that! ...

He, Miller and the writers had previously discussed leaking the footage themselves, and Reynolds initially thought that Miller had done so. He later believed the leak came from someone at Fox. In exchange for being able to make the film the way they wanted, Fox gave the crew a much smaller budget than is typical for superhero films.<ref name=\"ReynoldsLeakAttribution\" />\n\n====Writing====\nReese and Wernick wrote a draft of the script every year for six years before completing the film,<ref name=\"YahooFeb2016\"/> with around 70 percent of the first draft ending up in the final film.<ref name=\"CSRealHeroes\"/> Reese described Reynolds as \"the keeper of the Deadpool flame for many years ... if we ever do something that is off the Deadpool path, or if it doesn't feel like Deadpool, he catches it.\"<ref name=\"ReeseWernickMTVFeb2010\"/> The writers did not want the film to be an [[origin story]], but Reynolds disagreed. They settled on a \"modern\" Deadpool story as well as the origin story connected by Deadpool's narration and fourth wall breaking. This helped to balance the darker origin story with the cartoon-like Deadpool scenes. It also allowed the opening fight sequence to be extended through the first half of the film (with the origin story told throughout), saving money on additional fight scenes.<ref name=\"YahooFeb2016\"/> This fight sequence labeled the \"Twelve Bullets Fight\" reimagines the original test footage.<ref name=\"TrailerBreakdown\"/> Once the origin story is told, Deadpool uses a \"fast-forward button\" to return the audience to the present day.<ref name=\"YahooFeb2016\"/>\n\nIn October 2014, Kinberg confirmed that ''Deadpool'' would be set in the same [[shared universe]] as the ''X-Men'' films, but would \"stand independently\".<ref name=\"KinbergUniverse\"/> The writers wanted a traditional X-Man in the film as a foil to Deadpool and felt [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] was a character who had not been explored much in previous films.<ref name=\"YahooFeb2016\" /> Miller wanted \"more superhero stuff\", instead of \"just Deadpool and a lot of guns\". The character [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead]] was added as a trainee X-Man mentored by Colossus.<ref name=\"TrailerBreakdown\"/><ref name=\"YahooFeb2016\"/> She was chosen for her name from the list of comic characters available for use by Fox.<ref name=\"TrailerBreakdown\"/> The characters [[Garrison Kane]], [[Wyre (comics)|Wyre]] and Sluggo were included in the script at one point, but ultimately removed for budgetary reasons.<ref name=\"TrailerBreakdown\" /><ref name=\"ReeseWernickColliderNov2016\" /> These villains were replaced by a single character, [[Angel Dust (comics)|Angel Dust]].<ref name=\"io9Writers\" /> [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Emrys Killebrew]], Patch and [[Tar Baby (comics)|Tar Baby]] were also considered.<ref name=\"TrailerBreakdown\" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=updated|first=Eric Eisenberg last|date=2016-02-09|title=Two Classic Deadpool Characters That Were Cut From The Script, And Why|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Two-Classic-Deadpool-Characters-Were-Cut-From-Script-Why-111077.html|access-date=2021-11-15|website=CINEMABLEND|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"YahooNov2015\" /> The [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] character was also set to appear, but was eventually pushed to a potential sequel so this film could \"get Deadpool on his feet\" first.<ref name=\"ReeseWernickColliderNov2016\" />\n\nThe writers worked to keep the script's pop-culture references up-to-date throughout its development.<ref name=\"YahooNov2015\" /> Kinberg confirmed the film would make fun of Deadpool's portrayal in ''X-Men Origins: Wolverine''.<ref name=\"KinbergUniverse\" /> It also includes jokes at the expense of ''Green Lantern''.<ref name=\"TrailerBreakdown\" /> While Miller felt it was okay for audience members not to understand all of the film's jokes, he wanted to avoid anything targeted specifically at comic fans. He was not in favor of any joke the audience \"needs to look up on the internet\" after the movie ends.<ref name=\"TrailerBreakdown\" /> The film's post-credits scene is a parody of the equivalent scene from ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' (1986), where the title character of that film breaks the fourth wall like Deadpool. In the parody scene, Deadpool wears a bath robe and tells the audience to go home.<ref name=\"PostCredits\" /> He also confirms that Cable will appear in [[Deadpool 2|the sequel]].<ref name=\"CablePostCredits\" /> After reading the scene, a Fox executive described the film as a combination of ''Ferris Bueller's Day Off'' and ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' (1994), a description the writers felt was accurate.<ref name=\"PostCredits\" />\n\n[[File:5.12.18RhettReeseByLuigiNovi6.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Co-writer Rhett Reese said the studio's cuts to the film's budget made the script more efficient<ref name=\"io9Writers\" />|alt=The film's co-writer Rhett Reese smiling at a 2018 event]]\n48 hours before the film received the official green-light from Fox, the studio cut its budget by $7\u2013$8&nbsp;million,<ref name=\"io9Writers\" /> down to $58&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"BOM\" /> This forced a last minute re-write that saw about nine pages cut from the 110-page script. Changes included the removal of a motorcycle chase at the end of the Twelve Bullets Fight and having Deadpool forget his bag of guns before the final battle sequence to avoid having to shoot a costly gun fight in the third act. Reese said, \"It was that last, lean and mean chop that got us to a place where Fox was willing to make it. The script was very efficient and not too long.

Miller]] and [[Ed Skrein]] were in talks to appear in the film, with Miller as \"an additional comic voice\" and Skrein as a villain.<ref name=\"MillerSkreinTalks\" /> A month later, Fox was testing actresses to portray the female lead, including [[Morena Baccarin]], [[Taylor Schilling]], [[Crystal Reed]], [[Rebecca Rittenhouse]], [[Sarah Greene (actress)|Sarah Greene]] and [[Jessica De Gouw]].<ref name=\"SixActressesTest\" /> [[Gina Carano]] was cast as Angel Dust, and Miller was confirmed for an unspecified role.<ref name=\"MillerCaranoCast\" /> Baccarin was cast as Deadpool's love interest before the end of February.<ref name=\"BaccarinCast\" /> Colossus actor [[Daniel Cudmore]] said he would not be reprising the role for ''Deadpool'',<ref name=\"NoCudmore\" /> and declined an offer to provide reference for a CG version of the character to be voiced by another actor.<ref name=\"CudmoreExplanation\" />\n\nAn immediate focus during pre-production was Deadpool's suit.<ref name=\"Yahoo5Things\" /> Russ Shinkle and Film Illusions were hired to create the costume. Shinkle noted that \"comic book art is fairly over the top in terms of physique\", and he tried to balance that with reality.<ref name=\"ShinkleToS\" /> Reynolds did not wear a muscle suit under the costume, which Tim Miller felt gave it a slimmer, \"quintessential Deadpool\" look.<ref name=\"LivelySuit\" /> Miller and Reynolds wept when they saw the completed costume.<ref name=\"LivelySuit\" /><ref name=\"ReynoldsCBJul2015\" /> Reynolds explained, \"we fought like hell ... to make this the most faithful comic book to movie adaptation fans have ever seen. That's hard to accomplish and a feat, but we're just so happy with how this came out.\"<ref name=\"ReynoldsCBJul2015\" /> The costume was designed with the film's stunts in mind. The mask's eye areas were removable so versions of the eyes better suited for the stunts could be used without having to change the whole mask.<ref name=\"ShinkleToS\" /> The suit was difficult for the visual effects team to replicate with CGI. Visual effects supervisor Jonathan Rothbart blamed this on the suit's fabric. He described it as mesh that allowed dirt to \"get into the gutters and the cracks ... [so when] the light hits it, it still takes that orangey hue but as soon as it goes in the shadow it dropped to this more blueish of the dirt.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Film Illusions made six hero versions of the costume and twelve stunt-specific versions, along with three [[hero prop|hero versions]] of Negasonic Teenage Warhead's costume.<ref name=\"FilmIllusions\" />\n\nMiller wanted Deadpool's scarred appearance to make him appear \"fucking horrible\" to justify his anger.<ref name=\"TrailerBreakdown\" /> Makeup designer [[Bill Corso]] had some leeway because in the comics \"he's everything from a rotten corpse to a guy with a couple of lines on his face\". Corso acknowledged the script's description of the character as \"disfigured\" but also wanted him to be \"kind of charming and iconic\". He wanted to avoid comparisons with [[Freddy Krueger]] and looked to ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'' (2005) for inspiration.<ref name=\"CorsoColliderMar2016\" /> The final makeup required nine silicone prosthetics to cover Reynolds' head, which took several hours to apply.<ref name=\"CorsoTHRNov2016\" /> For the scene where the character is naked, it took six hours to apply Reynolds' full-body makeup.<ref name=\"TrailerBreakdown\" /> Corso described the makeup for the rest of the film's characters as \"pretty simple. Tim wanted to keep it really grounded.\"<ref name=\"CorsoColliderMar2016\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began on March 23, 2015, in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], under the [[working title]] ''Wham!''. Filming took place at [[North Shore Studios]] and on location around the city.<ref name=\"FilmingBegins\"/> The production hired over 2,000 locals as actors, extras and crew members.<ref name=\"CBC\" /> T. J. Miller and Baccarin were revealed to be playing [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]] and [[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|Vanessa]], respectively.<ref name=\"Weasel\" /><ref name=\"LiefeldVanessa\" /> Skrein confirmed he was in the film, playing [[Francis Fanny|Ajax]].<ref name=\"Ajax\" /> Newcomer [[Brianna Hildebrand]] was cast as Negasonic Teenage Warhead.<ref name=\"Hildebrand\" />\n\nTim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng wanted the film to look \"grittier and less clean and glossy\" than other superhero films. They decided to shoot with digital cameras but add [[film grain]] in post-production to give the images texture. Seng used Super Baltar lenses and Cooke zooms for the origin story timeline, and Panavision Primo lenses for the Deadpool scenes which gave them more clarity. The film's exterior scenes have a consistent overcast look, but location shooting came with \"unpredictable\" weather.<ref name=\"DMW\" /> For instance, the production had use of the [[Georgia Viaduct]] for two weeks and shot rain or shine before their permit expired. Seng used more lighting on cloudy days and less on sunny days to keep a consistent look.<ref name=\"FilmingBegins\" /><ref name=\"DMW\" /> Production designer Sean Haworth, who had specific ideas for the sets, also worked closely with Miller. The production had to be very specific about which elements of each set were constructed to conserve the budget for visual effects. For the final scrapyard scene, garbage was built to a certain height to be extended with CGI. A [[gimbal]] was used for a tilting section of the yard that had to interact with many digital elements.<ref name=\"Haworth\" /><ref name=\"Haworth2\" /> The final sequence was filmed in a naval yard dressed with scrap metal. Rubber casts of the metal were made for stunts.<ref name=\"HaworthComicCon2016\" />\n\n[[File:Deadpool, Georgia Viaduct, Vancouver, April 6 2015 - 3.jpg|thumb|upright|Stunt coordinator Philip J. Silvera in costume as Deadpool on set in Vancouver<ref name=\"FightFootage\" />|alt=refer to caption]]\nWhen Fox was unwilling to pay Reese and Wernick to be on set every day,<ref name=\"CSRealHeroes\" /> Reynolds paid their salaries.<ref name=\"ReynoldsPayWriters\" /> The writers had scripted the action very specifically, \"every kill and almost down to every punch, kick, or shot\", but Tim Miller and the stunt coordinators were free to change this.<ref name=\"CSRealHeroes\" /> Robert Alonzo and Philip J. Silvera were the film's [[stunt coordinators]];<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Silvera had provided motion capture reference for the test footage.<ref name=\"SilveraTest\" /> The stunt team had a month before filming began to prepare the actors. Skrein worked \"nonstop\" to prepare. Silvera said Reynolds \"has a photographic memory; he'd do something three or four times and remember it very well.\"<ref name=\"SilveraWtW\" /> A lot of the film's jokes were improvised on set, particularly by Reynolds.<ref name=\"YahooFeb2016\" /> He said the actors often came up with around 15 alternate jokes for each one in the script, and were generally only limited to those because of time constraints.<ref name=\"ReynoldsGoogle\" /> For example, Reese said Wernick had written some jokes for the scene where Deadpool visits Colossus and Negasonic. Instead Reynolds improvised the line on set, \"It's funny that I only ever see two of you. It's almost like the studio couldn't afford another X-Man.\" This was based in truth and became then Fox chairman [[Jim Gianopulos]]' favorite line.<ref name=\"YahooFeb2016\" /> Filming ended on May 29.<ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" />\n\n===Post-production===\n[[Leslie Uggams]] said that she was in the film in July 2015, portraying [[Blind Al]].<ref name=\"Uggams\" /> Tim Miller stated that [[Jed Rees]] portrays \"The Recruiter\", and \"did a good job of being creepy and syrupy sweet\". Miller explained that Colossus would be a solely CGI creation in the film,<ref name=\"TrailerBreakdown\" /> with Andre Tricoteux cast to provide motion reference on set for the role along with the voice.<ref name=\"Kapicic\" /><ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> In December, the voice of Colossus was recast, with [[Stefan Kapi\u010di\u0107]] taking over the role. He completed his work eight weeks before the film was scheduled for release.<ref name=\"Kapicic\" />\n\nAs soon as editor [[Julian Clarke]] began selecting shots for the film, they were [[color grading|color graded]] by [[EFILM]]'s Tim Stipan to ensure they all matched.<ref name=\"DMW\" /><ref name=\"ClarkeVerge\" /> Stipan colored the characters slightly differently. He gave Deadpool a \"dark, modern touch\" and Colossus a \"particular vibrancy and substance\".<ref name=\"StipanIF\" /> Clarke edited each scene focusing on humor, choosing between alternate takes of jokes. He removed jokes made after Vanessa is kidnapped because they felt inappropriately timed. He cut down other scenes with fewer jokes, such as Wilson being tortured, as they were \"too much\". It would take the audience \"too long to recover [and] get back in the irreverent spirit of the movie.\" During editing, a linear version of the film was produced. Clarke decided to go with interweaving the timelines to balance the different serious and silly tones.<ref name=\"ClarkeVerge\" />\n\nOne sequence removed from the film saw Wilson and Vanessa travel to Mexico looking for a cure after he turned down the recruiter. It was removed for pacing reasons and replaced with a short scene of Wilson sitting beside his window that was originally filmed to show him thinking about his diagnosis. In its new context the scene implies him re-thinking the recruiter's offer.<ref name=\"ClarkeCut\" />\n\nBecause of the animation required for Deadpool's mask and Colossus, Reese and Wernick had more freedom than usual to keep adjusting the script during post-production. Reynolds recorded new dialogue using his iPhone, and then re-recorded the lines in an [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|additional dialogue recording]] session once the film was finalized. Lines added after filming included Reynolds doing an impression of ''Wolverine'' star [[Hugh Jackman]]'s natural Australian accent, and another where Deadpool asks whether the character [[Charles Xavier (film series character)|Professor X]] is being portrayed by [[James McAvoy]] or [[Patrick Stewart]] at that point in the ''X-Men'' timeline. This became a favorite line in the film for many audience members.<ref name=\"ReeseWernickBIJan2017\" />\n\n====Visual effects====\n[[Digital Domain]] (DD), Atomic Fiction, Blur Studio, [[Weta Digital]], [[Rodeo FX]], and [[Luma Pictures]] produced ''Deadpool''{{'}}s visual effects.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Reynolds credited Miller and his visual effects experience with producing a film that looked like others made with bigger budgets.<ref name=\"ReynoldsGoogle\" /> Motion capture supervisor Greg LaSalle agreed, noting that Miller held off working on the CGI for Colossus until after the film was edited to avoid spending money on shots that would not be used.<ref name=\"LaSalle\" /> Miller worked with visual effects supervisor Jonathan Rothbart to design and complete the film's 1500 effects shots\u2014700 more than originally planned. 800 of them were completed in the last four weeks of production.<ref name=\"Rothbart\" />\n\n[[File:Colossus - mocap.jpg|thumb|left|Top: Andre Tricoteux (center) on set as Colossus, wearing a gray tracking suit. Bottom: Completed shot, with CG Colossus by Digital Domain and environment by Atomic Fiction.|alt=refer to caption]]\nColossus's movements were re-recorded with performer [[T. J. Storm]], as Tricoteux had been unable to move athletically because of the platform shoes he wore on set to replicate the character's height. LaSalle was used for his facial performance. DD then mapped these performances onto a digital model that was designed to be comic-accurate. The team sought specific reference for Colossus's metallic finish to avoid looking \"chromey\", visiting a metal company to look at samples. They settled on [[Cold-formed steel|cold rolled steel]], with the darker [[Hot working|hot rolled steel]] used for his hair. The model also includes ridges which could be moved separately to keep them perfectly straight as in the comic books.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> DD also created the model of Deadpool that was used by all the FX vendors. His mask was animated around the eyes to be expressive as in the comics. This helped balance out the \"chinwag\" coming through the bottom of the mask as Reynolds acted. Fully replacing Deadpool's head was going to be too costly, so Weta Digital warped each shot based on facial references from Reynolds and adjusted the lighting to reflect the changes instead. This was called an \"ingenious 2D-ish solution\".<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nAtomic Fiction created a freeway environment for the Twelve Bullets Fight, with a backdrop based on Detroit, Chicago, and Vancouver. They also created the vehicles used in the sequence.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> These assets were used by Blur for the opening titles, which move through a frozen moment where Deadpool is fighting thugs inside a crashing car. The amusing titles include \"Directed by an overpaid tool\" and \"Produced by asshats\".<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Reynolds, Miller, and the writers came up with their own credits hoping to set the tone for the film.<ref name=\"YahooFeb2016\" />\n\nLuma contributed the film's blood and gore using practical footage as well as digital effects for more complex scenes. When Deadpool cuts off his own hand, DD did not want to be \"outdone\" by Luma and had \"buckets of blood pouring out\". Luma created the regrowing hand, inspired by the hand of a fetus.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> When Deadpool breaks both his hands, DD went through 20 or 30 different versions of what broken fingers could look like.<ref name=\"CBC\" /> For Deadpool's initial scarring from the warehouse fire, Rodeo FX referenced rotting fruit and maggot-eaten meat. The company added a CG penis to Reynolds in this sequence, which visual effects supervisor Wayne Brinton said, \"you don't even notice [but] when it wasn't there it looked really weird\". Rodeo also augmented the practical fire in the scene.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nThe vendors all collaborated for the final battle sequence, which takes place in the wreckage of a helicarrier. Luma created the climactic fight between Deadpool and Ajax; DD created most of the Colossus effects until he is damaged when Blur Studio took over; DD created the effects for Negasonic Teenage Warhead's abilities as well as expanding the helicarrier's deck; Rodeo contributed [[matte paintings]] for the background; and Weta provided the facial animation for Deadpool.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /><ref name=\"HelicarrierArt\" /> Negasonic's abilities were the only \"supernatural effect-sy thing\" in the film, and were based on [[Thermobaric weapon|fuel-air explosives]] and [[solar flare]]s to try to ground them in reality.<ref name=\"Rothbart\" /> Setting the final sequence on the wrecked helicarrier was Miller's idea. This helped to expand the scope of the third act and include more connections to the comics and the wider Marvel Universe.<ref name=\"HelicarrierSR\" /> To avoid rights issues with Marvel Studios, the helicarrier for ''Deadpool'' was designed to be \"as different as possible from the one in ''The Avengers''\".<ref name=\"HelicarrierArt\" /> Additionally, a French animation artist with a \"unique style\" created 2D cartoon characters that dance around Deadpool after he is stabbed in the head during the fight.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Deadpool (soundtrack)}}\n[[Tom Holkenborg]] announced in October 2015 that he would compose the score for ''Deadpool''.<ref name=\"Holkenborg\" /> Noting that Deadpool only makes pre-1990 musical references,<ref name=\"HolkenborgCreators\" /> Holkenborg decided to use sounds from the 1980s in the movie's main theme, such as those of an [[Oberheim Electronics#Oberheim polyphonic synthesizers|Oberheim]] and a [[Synclavier]].<ref name=\"HolkenborgStudio\" /><ref name=\"HolkenborgStudio2\" /> Several songs were written in to Reese and Wernick's script to be used in the film. Some of these ultimately did not work as intended. For example, the sex montage with Wilson and Vanessa was to play out to [[Frank Sinatra]]'s version of \"[[It Was a Very Good Year]]\" in the script, but this was changed to [[Neil Sedaka]]'s \"[[Calendar Girl (song)|Calendar Girl]]\" during editing.<ref name=\"ClarkeCut\" /> A soundtrack album featuring Holkenborg's score and the songs heard in the film was released digitally on February 12, 2016, and physically on March 4 through [[Milan Records]].<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n{{main|Marketing for Deadpool (film)}}\nDue to the film's limited marketing budget, Reynolds worked closely with Fox's marketing chief Marc Weinstock to use the Internet to their advantage and come up with cheaper, \"Deadpool-based\" ways to market the film.<ref name=\"ReynoldsMarketing\" /><ref name=\"AdAgeSocialMedia\" /> This included unique trailers,<ref name=\"THRTrailer\" /><ref name=\"Teaser\" /> unconventional billboards,<ref name=\"WiredMarketing\" /><ref name=\"SRMarketing\" /> promotional tie-ins with [[Super Bowl 50]] and [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]],<ref name=\"SemMarketing\" /><ref name=\"Commercials\" /> and an extensive social media presence.<ref name=\"WiredMarketing\" /> Reynolds kept one of the Deadpool costumes for himself, and appeared in it throughout the marketing campaign.<ref name=\"Yahoo5Things\" /> Visual effects vendor [[Image Engine]] animated Deadpool's mask for these appearances, using a process similar to that used by Weta Digital for the film.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Emma Grey Ellis at [[Wired.com]] described the campaign as \"crazy and unrelenting\" with Deadpool waging a \"marketing siege of every platform you would think of\".<ref name=\"WiredMarketing\" /> Bobby Anhalt at [[Screen Rant]] called it possibly \"the best film marketing campaign in the history of cinema\".<ref name=\"SRMarketing\" /> [[HostGator]]'s Jeremy Jensen attributed the campaign's success to Reynolds, and to Fox for embracing the film's R rating.<ref name=\"HGMarketing\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\n''Deadpool''{{'}}s world premiere was held at the [[Grand Rex]] in Paris on February 8, 2016,<ref name=\"Premiere\" /> before its initial theatrical release in Hong Kong the next day.

It's graphic. Nothing is taboo. You either commit to a truly outrageous boundary-pushing kind of movie or you don't.\"<ref name=\"RatedR\" /> China forbade the film's release because of this. Though R-rated American films are often \"cleaned up\" for release there, it was decided that doing so was impossible without affecting the plot.<ref name=\"NoChina\" /> It was not released in Uzbekistan after theater owners in the country decided against showing the film because of its age restriction and how it violated the country's societal norms.<ref name=\"NoUzbekistan\" /> ''Deadpool'' received seven \"general cuts\" to obtain approval for release in India.<ref name=\"India\" /> Despite being blocked in China during this initial release, ''Deadpool'' eventually premiered in the country during the 2018 [[Beijing International Film Festival]], which ran over a week from April 15\u201322.

It was nominated for two [[Golden Globe Awards]],<ref name=\"GoldenGlobe\" /> four [[Critics' Choice Movie Awards]] (winning two),<ref name=\"CriticsChoice\" /> a [[Directors Guild of America Award]],<ref name=\"DGA\" /> five [[Empire Awards]],<ref name=\"EmpireAwards\" /> seven [[Golden Trailer Awards]] (winning two),<ref name=\"GTA17\" /> a [[Hugo Award]],<ref name=\"Hugo\" /> two [[Key Art Awards]] for marketing (winning both),<ref name=\"KeyArt\" /> eight [[MTV Movie Awards]] (winning two),<ref name=\"MMA\" /> a [[Producers Guild of America Award]],<ref name=\"PGAAwards\" /> four [[People's Choice Awards]] (winning two),<ref name=\"PeoplesChoice\" /><ref name=\"PeoplesChoice2\" /> three [[Saturn Award]]s (winning one),<ref name=\"SaturnAwards\" /> six [[Teen Choice Awards]] (winning two)<ref name=\"TeenChoice\" /> and a [[Writers Guild of America Awards|Writers Guild of America Award]].<ref name=\"WGAAwards\" />\n\nAfter being nominated for awards such as the Golden Globes, Critics' Choice, and Writers Guild of America, ''Deadpool'' was considered a serious contender by commentators for several [[Academy Awards]], despite its content and tone.<ref name=\"VFOscars\" /> This included potential nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup and Hairstyling]], and after its Producers Guild of America nomination, [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].<ref name=\"USAOscars\" /><ref name=\"ColliderOscars\" /> When the film did not receive any Academy Award nominations, it was widely considered to have been \"[[wikt:snub|snubbed]]\".<ref name=\"OscarsSnub\" /> Analyzing potential reasons for this, Screen Rant's Alex Leadbeater said that while the film \"earned a solid thumbs up from most\", it was generally not praised by top critics for offering any \"depth or related subversion of its genre\". He also noted an apparent bias that Academy voters have against superhero films; the lack of a targeted campaign for the awards by Fox, who did not seem to be expecting any of the film's previous awards either; and the number of other films in contention, as \"2016 was, all in all, a pretty good year for movies\".<ref name=\"OscarsAnalysis\" /> A variant cover for Marvel Comics' ''[[X-Men Gold]]'' #1, with art by [[Ron Lim]] and released in April 2017, references ''Deadpool''{{'}}s Oscar snub.<ref name=\"SnubVariant\" />\n\n===Cinematic impact===\nBefore ''Deadpool''{{'}}s success, R-rated, comic-based films considered successful were ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' (2006) and ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' (2009), which earned about half the opening weekend gross of successful PG-13 superhero films. ''Kick-Ass'', a film tonally similar to ''Deadpool'', made even less with a $19.8&nbsp;million opening. Many reasons were given why ''Deadpool'' went on to be more successful than these, including the popularity of the Marvel brand and Reynolds' performance.<ref name=\"DeadlineWeekend\" /> Tom Huddleston, Jr. wrote for ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' that ''Deadpool'' was proof to Hollywood that R-rated films can be as successful as PG-13 films, \"particularly when fans see the rating itself as validation that the film is true to its source material\".<ref name=\"FortuneR\" />\n\nA Hollywood executive, not involved with the film, felt it succeeded because it \"has a self-deprecating tone that's riotous. It's never been done before. It's poking fun at Marvel. That label takes itself so seriously; can you imagine them making fun of themselves in a movie?\" [[James Gunn]], director of Marvel's ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', rejected this saying ''Deadpool'' was a success because \"it's original, it's damn good ... and it wasn't afraid to take risks\". Gunn hoped studios would learn \"the right lesson\" from the film and not just try to make more films like ''Deadpool''.<ref name=\"Gunn\" /> After Fox's ''[[Logan (film)|Logan]]'' (2017) also became a success, ''Forbes''{{'}} Paul Tassi reiterated Gunn's sentiments, saying the rating was \"appropriate given the 'adult' nature of these two heroes\", but \"too much stock is being put into unrestrained violence rather than people examining what actually makes these movies work\".<ref name=\"ForbesR\" /> Graeme McMillan of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' concurred, adding, \"Why not take the freedom that comes from that rating and try to re-approach the mainstream genre with that attitude?\"<ref name=\"THRR\" />\n\nIn March 2017, a [[Warner Bros.]] executive said that an R-rated [[DC Extended Universe]] film could \"absolutely\" happen,<ref name=\"DCR\" /> while [[Sony Pictures]] began developing an R-rated adaptation of the character [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] with a smaller budget, inspired by Fox's success with ''Deadpool'' and ''Logan'' (even though ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'' was released under the [[PG-13 (Motion Picture Association)|PG-13]] rating).<ref name=\"VenomR\" /> In June, Kevin Feige said in response to the successes that, though Marvel Studios was not planning any R-rated films for its [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], \"it's not out of the question\".<ref name=\"FeigeR\" /> After the [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney]] was announced in December 2017, Disney CEO [[Bob Iger]] said that the company would be willing to make future R-rated Marvel films like ''Deadpool'', potentially under a \"Marvel-R\" brand, \"as long as we let the audiences know what's coming\".<ref name=\"DisneyMarvelR\" />\n\n==Sequels==\n{{further|X-Men (film series)|List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films}}\n\n===''Deadpool 2''===\n{{main|Deadpool 2}}\nBefore ''Deadpool''{{'}}s release, Fox green-lit a sequel with Reese and Wernick returning to write the screenplay.<ref name=\"GreenLight\"/> The involvement of Reynolds and Tim Miller was confirmed at the 2016 CinemaCon in April,<ref name=\"CinemaCon2016\" /> but Miller left the film at the end of October over \"mutual creative differences\" with Reynolds.<ref name=\"MillerExit\" /> The next month, [[David Leitch (director)|David Leitch]] signed on to direct the sequel.<ref name=\"LeitchConfirmed\" /> Leitch first made a short film, ''[[No Good Deed (2017 film)|No Good Deed]]'', which was written by Reese and Wernick.<ref name=\"ReeseWernickShort\" /><ref name=\"MangoldPost\" /> ''[[Deadpool 2]]'' was released on May 18, 2018,<ref name=\"SequelReleaseDate\" /> with Baccarin,<ref name=\"BaccarinSequel\" /> T.

''[[X-Force]]'' is where we're launching something bigger, but then ''[[Deadpool 3]]'' is where we're contracting and staying personal and small.\"<ref name=\"ReeseMar2017\" /> After the acquisition of Fox by Disney was announced in December 2017 and completed in March 2019, Bob Iger said that Deadpool and other Marvel properties at Fox would be integrated with the Marvel Cinematic Universe under Disney's Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"DisneyFoxMCU\" /> In December 2019, Reynolds confirmed that a third ''Deadpool'' film was in development at [[Marvel Studios]].<ref name=\"ReynoldsDec2019\" /> Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige reiterated in January 2021. He confirmed that the third Deadpool film would take place in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref name=\"Collider Feige Interview\" />\n\nIn March 2022, [[Shawn Levy]] (who previously collaborated with Reynolds on ''[[Free Guy]]'' and ''[[The Adam Project]]'') joined as director, with Reese and Wernick returning to write the screenplay.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Parker |first=Ryan |date=2022-03-11 |title='Deadpool 3': Shawn Levy to Direct Ryan Reynolds in Marvel Movie (Exclusive) |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/deadpool-3-ryan-reynolds-shawn-levy-marvel-1235109465/ |access-date=2022-03-11 |website=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> The film is set to be released on November 8, 2024 with [[Hugh Jackman]] returning to play [[Logan (film character)|Wolverine]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Moreau |first=Jordan |date=2022-09-27 |title=Hugh Jackman Is Back as Wolverine in 'Deadpool 3' With Ryan Reynolds, Coming in 2024 |url=https://variety.com/2022/film/news/hugh-jackman-wolverine-1235385694/ |access-date=2022-09-27 |website=Variety |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"ProducedByFox\">{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/deadpool-denied-release-china-due-856627 | title = 'Deadpool' Denied Release in China Due to Graphic Violence | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | first = Patrick | last = Brzeski | date = January 17, 2016 | access-date = January 13, 2020 | archive-date = June 13, 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170613182240/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/deadpool-denied-release-china-due-856627 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ArtisanDeal\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/news/artisan-deal-a-real-marvel-1117781709/|title=Artisan deal a real Marvel|last=Fleming|first=Michael|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 16, 2000|access-date=April 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410235214/http://variety.com/2000/film/news/artisan-deal-a-real-marvel-1117781709/|archive-date=April 10, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"GoyerConfirms\">{{cite web|url=https://ign.com/articles/2004/02/26/goyer-confirms-deadpool|title=Goyer Confirms Deadpool|last=Otto|first=Jeff|website=[[IGN]]|date=February 2, 2004|access-date=July 12, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107021014/http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/02/26/goyer-confirms-deadpool|archive-date=November 7, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"DevelopmentBegins\">{{cite web|url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2008/12/11/deadpool-and-gambit-the-long-road-to-x-men-origins-wolverine-and-beyond/|title=Deadpool And Gambit: The Long Road To 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'...
