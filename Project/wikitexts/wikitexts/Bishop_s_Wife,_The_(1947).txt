The plot is about an angel who helps a bishop with his problems. The film was adapted by [[Leonardo Bercovici]] and [[Robert E. Sherwood]] from the 1928 novel of the same name by [[Robert Nathan]].\n\nIt was remade in 1996 as ''[[The Preacher's Wife]]'' starring [[Denzel Washington]], [[Whitney Houston]], and [[Courtney B. Vance]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Bishop]] Henry Brougham ([[David Niven]]), troubled with funding the building of a new [[cathedral]], prays for divine guidance. His plea is seemingly answered by a suave [[angel]] named Dudley ([[Cary Grant]]), who reveals his identity only to the clergyman.\n\nHowever, Dudley's mission is not to help construct a cathedral, but to spiritually guide Henry and the people around him. Henry has become obsessed with raising funds, to the detriment of his family life. His relationships with wife Julia ([[Loretta Young]]) and their young daughter Debby ([[Karolyn Grimes]]) are strained by his focus on the cathedral.\n\nEveryone, except for Henry, is charmed by Dudley, even the non-religious Professor Wutheridge ([[Monty Woolley]]). Dudley persuades the wealthy parishioners, particularly widowed Agnes Hamilton ([[Gladys Cooper]]), to contribute needed funds, but not to build the cathedral. He coaxes Mrs. Hamilton to donate her money to feed and clothe the needy \u2014 much to Henry's chagrin. To save time, Dudley also redecorates the Broughams' Christmas tree in a few seconds, saves an old church by restoring interest in the boys' choir, and dictates to a [[typewriter]] to magically produce Henry's new [[sermon]] \u2014 without his knowledge.\n\nWhen Dudley spends time cheering up Julia, though, an unexpected development occurs: he finds himself strongly attracted to her. Sensing this, Henry becomes jealous and anxious for his now unwelcome guest to finish and depart. He reveals Dudley's true identity to Professor Wutheridge, who urges him to stand up and fight for the woman he loves.\n\nDudley indicates a willingness to stay, but Julia, sensing what he means, tells him it is time for him to leave. Dudley tells the bishop it is rare for an angel to envy a mortal. When Henry wants to know why his cathedral plans were derailed, Dudley reminds the bishop he prayed for guidance, not a building.\n\nWith his mission completed and knowing that Julia loves her husband, Dudley leaves, promising never to return. All memory of him is erased, and later that [[Christmas Eve]] at midnight, Henry delivers the sermon he believes he has written. Dudley observes from the street, satisfied that his work is done.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Dudley\n* [[Loretta Young]] as Julia Brougham\n* [[David Niven]] as Bishop Henry Brougham\n* [[Monty Woolley]] as Professor Wutheridge\n* [[James Gleason]] as Sylvester, a sympathetic taxi driver\n* [[Gladys Cooper]] as Mrs. Agnes Hamilton\n* [[Elsa Lanchester]] as Matilda, the Broughams' housekeeper \n* [[Sara Haden]] as Mildred Cassaway, the Bishop's secretary\n* [[Karolyn Grimes]] as Debby Brougham, the Broughams' daughter\n* [[Tito Vuolo]] as Maggenti\n* [[Regis Toomey]] as Reverend Miller (credited as Mr. Miller)\n* [[Sarah Edwards (actress)|Sarah Edwards]] as Mrs. Duffy\n* [[Margaret McWade]] as Miss Trumbull\n* [[Anne O'Neal]] as Mrs. Ward\n* Ben Erway as Mr. Perry\n* [[Erville Alderson]] as Stevens\n* [[Bobby Anderson (actor)|Robert J.

However, Wright had to bow out due to pregnancy. According to [[Robert Osborne]], Andrews was lent to RKO in order to obtain Loretta Young. Koster then brought in Cary Grant, but he wanted to play the angel, so the role of the bishop was given to Niven.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:The_Bishop's_Wife_poster_with_textbox.jpg|thumb|150px|left|In markets where the original title was kept, the posters had a black text box added]]\n[[File:Cary_and_the_Bishop's_Wife_poster.jpg|thumb|200px|right|In some US markets, the film was retitled \"Cary and the Bishop's Wife\"]]\n[[File:Cary Grant in 'The Bishop's Wife', 1947.jpg|thumb|Advertisement in the ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'']]\nProduction was not without troubles. Producer Samuel Goldwyn replaced director [[William A. Seiter]] with Henry Koster to create a completely new film. In early previews, audiences disliked the film, so [[Billy Wilder]] and [[Charles Brackett]] made uncredited rewrites. Even so, and even though the premiere of ''The Bishop's Wife'' was accompanied by critical success, the film didn't do very well at the box office at first. Market research showed that moviegoers avoided the film because they thought it was religious.  So, Goldwyn decided to re-title it ''Cary and the Bishop's Wife'' for some US markets, while adding a black text box with the question \"Have you heard about CARY AND THE BISHOP'S WIFE?\" on posters in markets where the film kept the original title. By adding Grant's first name to the title the film's business increased by as much as 25 percent.<ref name=GrantWeb/><ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sMPSqFrycu0C&dq=%22Cary+and+the+Bishop%27s+wife%22&pg=PA93| first=Peter E.| last=Dans| title=Christians in the Movies: A Century of Saints and Sinners| page=93| publisher=Rowman & Littlefield| date=May 16, 2009| isbn=978-0-7425-7032-0| access-date=December 5, 2021}}</ref>\n\nLocation filming was in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039190/locations Filming locations for ''The Bishop's Wife''] at [[IMDb]]</ref> In the scene in which Dudley conducts the boys' choir, the [[Charles Gounod]] composition 'No\u00ebl: Montez \u00e0 Dieu' ('O Sing to God') was performed by the [[Robert Mitchell Boys Choir]].<ref>{{YouTube| id=EgIvJl2P3JI| title=Boys' Choir scene from ''The Bishop's Wife''}}</ref> The song \"Lost April\" featured in the film had lyrics written for it by [[Nat King Cole]], who also recorded it.\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] ''The Bishop's Wife'' holds a score of {{RT data|score}} from {{RT data|count}} reviews.
