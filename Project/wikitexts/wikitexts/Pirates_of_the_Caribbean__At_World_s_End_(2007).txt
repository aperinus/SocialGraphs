It follows [[Will Turner]], [[Elizabeth Swann]], [[Hector Barbossa]], and the crew of the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' as they seek to rescue [[Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow]] from [[Geography of Pirates of the Caribbean#Davy Jones' Locker|Davy Jones' Locker]]. They then prepare to fight the East India Trading Company, led by [[List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters#Cutler Beckett|Cutler Beckett]], who controls [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]] and plans to extinguish [[piracy]] forever.\n\nTwo sequels to ''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'' were conceived in 2004, with Elliott and Rossio developing a story arc that would span both films. The film was shot in two shoots during 2005 and 2006, the former of which was released as ''Dead Man's Chest''. This also marks the final film of the series to be directed by Verbinski. With a production budget of nearly US$300 million, it was, at time of production, the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive film]] ever made.\n \n[[Walt Disney Pictures]] released the film in the United States on May 18, 2007. While the film received mixed reviews, ''At World's End'' was the [[2007 in film#Highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of 2007]], bringing in over $960&nbsp;million. It was nominated at the [[80th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], and won Favorite Movie Actor for [[Johnny Depp]] at the [[2008 Kids' Choice Awards]].

Condemned prisoners sing \"[[Hoist the Colours]]\" to compel the nine Pirate Lords to convene at [[Shipwreck Cove]] to hold the [[Brethren Court]]. Because Pirate Lord [[Jack Sparrow]] never named a successor before being dragged to [[Davy Jones' Locker]], [[Captain Barbossa|Hector Barbossa]], [[Will Turner]], [[Elizabeth Swann]], [[Tia Dalma]], and the surviving crew of the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' plot to rescue Jack. In [[Singapore]], the crew meet Pirate Lord [[Sao Feng]], who owns navigational charts to the Locker. They are then attacked by the East India Trading Company. During the battle, Will secretly promises to give Jack to Feng in return for the ''Pearl'', intending to use it to rescue his father [[Bootstrap Bill Turner|\"Bootstrap Bill\" Turner]] from the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]''.\n\nThe crew rescue Jack and recover the ''Pearl''. As they depart, they encounter boats of dead souls, including Elizabeth's father [[Weatherby Swann|Governor Swann]], executed by Beckett. Tia Dalma reveals that the goddess [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]] charged Davy Jones with guiding the souls of those who died at sea to the next world; every ten years he could come ashore to be with the woman he loved, but Jones corrupted his purpose and was cursed to become a monster. Governor Swann reveals that whoever kills Jones by stabbing his disembodied heart must become the ''Dutchman''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s captain.\n\nReturning to the living world, the ''Pearl'' stops at an island for fresh water, but are attacked by Sao Feng and Beckett's men. As Jack secretly negotiates his freedom with Beckett, Elizabeth is handed over to Feng, who believes she is Calypso, while the rest of the crew make for Shipwreck Cove aboard the ''Pearl''. Jack throws Will off the ship as part of a plan to seize control of the ''Dutchman''. Sao Feng tells Elizabeth that the first Brethren Court bound Calypso in human form after she betrayed her lover, Davy Jones; Feng plans to release her to defeat Beckett. Feng is fatally wounded in an attack by Jones, appointing Elizabeth his successor as Pirate Lord before dying. Elizabeth and the crew are locked in the brig of the ''Dutchman'', where she finds Bootstrap Bill losing himself to the ''Dutchman''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s curse. Admiral [[James Norrington]] frees Elizabeth and her crew from the ''Dutchman'', but is killed by a crazed Bootstrap Bill.\n\nWill is rescued by Beckett and informs Jones of Jack's escape from the Locker, learning in the process that Jones enabled the first Court to imprison Calypso, revealed to be Tia Dalma. Meanwhile, the ''Pearl'' arrives at Shipwreck Cove, where Barbossa attempts to persuade the Brethren Court to release Calypso while Elizabeth demands they fight back against Beckett. Jack's father, [[List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters#Captain Teague|Captain Teague]], informs the Court that only an elected Pirate King can declare war. To avoid a stalemate, Jack votes for Elizabeth, making her King. Elizabeth, Jack, Barbossa, Beckett, Jones, and Will [[parley]], trading Will for Jack. Barbossa frees Calypso, but when Will reveals Jones' betrayal to her, Calypso vanishes and summons a [[whirlpool|maelstrom]].\n\nThe ''Pearl'' and ''Dutchman'' battle in the maelstrom. Elizabeth and Will are wed by Barbossa in the midst of the battle. On the ''Dutchman'', Jack and Jones duel for control of Jones' heart. After Jones mortally wounds Will, Jack helps Will stab the heart, killing Jones. Jack and Elizabeth escape the ''Dutchman'' as it sinks into the maelstrom. As Beckett's ship, the ''Endeavour'', engages the ''Pearl'', the ''Dutchman'' rises from the sea, now captained by Will and its crew freed from Jones' curse. The two pirate ships destroy the ''Endeavour'', killing Beckett. With Will bound to guide souls lost at sea to the next world, he and Elizabeth bid farewell to each other. Will departs on the ''Dutchman'', leaving Elizabeth pregnant and with the chest containing his heart. Barbossa mutinies against Jack and steals the ''Pearl'' again to find the [[Fountain of Youth]], but finds that Jack has stolen Feng's charts. Jack departs from [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]] to track the fountain down.\n\nIn a post-credits scene set ten years later, Elizabeth and her son [[List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters#Henry Turner|Henry]] watch Will return aboard the ''Dutchman''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Pirates of the Caribbean cast members|List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters|l2=characters}}\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Sea captain|Captain]] [[Jack Sparrow]]: Sparrow and the ''Black Pearl'' have been dragged to [[Davy Jones' Locker (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones' Locker]] by the [[Kraken]]; he is trapped there until his former crew mounts a rescue party.
