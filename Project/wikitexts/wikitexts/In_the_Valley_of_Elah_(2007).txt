The film stars [[Tommy Lee Jones]], [[Charlize Theron]], and [[Susan Sarandon]]. Its title refers to the [[Valley of Elah|Biblical valley]] where the battle between [[David]] and [[Goliath]] took place.\n\nPaul Haggis's ''In The Valley of Elah'' is based on actual events, although the characters' names and locations have been changed. The screenplay was inspired by [[journalist]] [[Mark Boal]]'s \"Death and Dishonor\", an article about the murder case published in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine in 2004.\n\nIt portrays a military father's search for his son and, after his body is found, subsequent hunt for his son's killers. The film explores themes including the [[Iraq War]], abuse of prisoners, and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).\n\n==Plot==\nOn November 1, 2004, Hank Deerfield \u2013 a gravel trucker and retired [[military police]] sergeant living in [[Tennessee]] with his wife Joan \u2013 is notified that his son Mike, a [[United States Army|soldier]] recently returned from [[Iraq War|Iraq]], has gone missing. Hank drives to Mike\u2019s base in [[New Mexico]] to look for him; leaving home, he helps a school custodian raise the American flag correctly. At Fort Rudd, Hank meets his son\u2019s squad, and secretly takes Mike\u2019s cell phone from his belongings. Watching videos recovered from the phone, he attempts to report Mike\u2019s disappearance to police detective Emily Sanders, after she finished talking to a woman whose dog has been murdered, regrettably unable to help out, and reaches out to a friend formerly at [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|Army CID]], without success.\n\nMike\u2019s burned and dismembered body is discovered. Fort Rudd claims jurisdiction, believing that a [[drug paraphernalia|pipe]] found under Mike\u2019s mattress and the recent arrest of other soldiers for smuggling [[heroin]] indicate his murder was drug-related. Hank persuades Sanders to show him the crime scene, and realizes that a green car spotted at the scene was actually blue. Belittled by her male colleagues, Sanders convinces the local sheriff to pursue the investigation, and Mike\u2019s squadmate SPC Gordon Bonner reaches out to Hank.\n\nAfter viewing her son\u2019s remains, Joan returns home and receives a package Mike mailed to himself, which Hank urges her not to open. Mike\u2019s credit card history leads Sanders and Hank to a restaurant, where Hank deduces Mike ate with at least two other people shortly before his death. Sanders is given sworn statements from Mike\u2019s squad by Army investigators, preventing her from interviewing them herself. She invites Hank over for dinner, and he tells her young son the story of the Biblical [[David]]\u2019s battle with [[Goliath]] in the [[Valley of Elah]].\n\nEve, a topless bartender Hank previously questioned, recognizes Mike\u2019s squadmate CPL Steve Penning from a photograph, leading Hank to learn that Mike and Penning were kicked out of a strip club the night Mike was killed. Sanders interviews Penning, Bonner, and SPC Ennis Long, who admit to lying in their statements: after Mike got the four of them kicked out of the club, he and Bonner fought in the parking lot; Mike then paid for their food at the restaurant, and they visited a prostitute before leaving Mike, who was looking to buy drugs. Hank refuses to believe Mike\u2019s fellow soldiers could be involved in his death.\n\nHank and the police determine that another member of Mike\u2019s squad, PVT Robert Ortiz, is [[desertion|AWOL]], with a history of drug smuggling and a blue car. Following the police as they raid Ortiz\u2019s address, Hank subdues the fleeing Ortiz and beats him until detectives intervene. Ortiz is arrested, but Bonner is found hanged with Mike\u2019s grandfather\u2019s watch in his pocket. Sanders concludes that Bonner, who also owned a blue car, killed Mike. She learns that Angie, a soldier\u2019s wife who came to her for help, has been murdered by her husband.\n\nHank has his son\u2019s remains sent home, and Penning helps jump-start his truck, reminiscing about Mike. Sanders matches Penning's handwriting to the signature on Mike\u2019s last credit card statement, and realizes Penning, Bonner, and Long killed Mike, then used his credit card at the restaurant. Penning has already come forward and received a plea deal, but at Sanders\u2019 insistence, she and Hank hear his confession in person: he admits to stabbing Mike after a seemingly insignificant quarrel. Hank asks him about a video of Mike torturing a captive insurgent, and the [[post-traumatic stress disorder|emotionally distant]] Penning explains, \u201cWe all do stupid things\u201d. He also states that anyone could have died in that quarrel or a similar one, and that Mike \"was the smart one [and that] he could see\", thereby implying Mike may have brought the aggression upon himself out of nihilistic despondency and the realization of the group's inability to readjust to civilian life.\n\nCollecting Mike\u2019s belongings, Hank apologizes to Ortiz, who has been [[military discharge|honorably discharged]]. Haunted by his last conversation with his son, after Mike drove over an Iraqi child playing in the road, Hank thanks Sanders and returns home. He finds Joan opened Mike\u2019s package, which contains a picture of his squad and a [[military funerals in the United States|folded flag]]. Returning to the local school\u2019s flagpole, Hank flies his son\u2019s flag [[Flag desecration#Flying a U.S. flag upside down|upside down]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Hank Deerfield\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as Detective Emily Sanders\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Joan Deerfield\n* [[Jonathan Tucker]] as Mike \"Doc\" Deerfield\n* [[James Franco]] as Sergeant First Class Dan Carnelli\n* [[Josh Brolin]] as Sheriff Buchwald\n* [[Frances Fisher]] as Eve\n* [[Wayne Duvall]] as Detective Nugent\n* [[Jason Patric]] as First Lieutenant Kirklander\n* Victor Wolf as Private Robert Ortiz\n* [[Brent Briscoe]] as Detective Hodge\n* [[Greg Serano]] as Detective Manny Nu\u00f1ez\n* [[Barry Corbin]] as Arnold Bickman\n* [[Brent Sexton]] as Lieutenant Burke\n* [[Zoe Kazan]] as Angie\n* [[Wes Chatham]] as Corporal Steve Penning\n* [[Glenn Taranto]] as Detective Wayne\n* [[Jake McLaughlin]] as Specialist Gordon Bonner\n* [[Sean Huze]] as Captain Jim Osher\n* [[Mehcad Brooks]] as Specialist Ennis Long\n* [[Rick Gonzalez]] as Phone Technician\n* [[Kathy Lamkin]] as Chicken Shack Manager\n* [[Jo Harvey Allen]] as Jo Anne\n* Mike Hatfield as  Jo Anne's Husband\n* Arlin Alcala as the neighbor\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Factual basis===\nAlthough the film story is fictional, with the names and locations changed, it is based on the facts of the murder case of [[Richard T. Davis]] of Baker Company, [[15th Infantry Regiment (United States)|1-15 IN]].  Davis was an [[Iraq War]] veteran who was murdered soon after his return home in 2003.  Richard Davis's father, Lanny Davis, was a former military police officer.  He mounted his own investigation into the crime, as did the character played by Jones in the film.  Davis commented, \"It's a strong movie and a good movie. And it's going to make a lot of people think.\"<ref>{{cite news\n |url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-09-11-tommy-lee-jones_N.htm\n |title= Tommy Lee Jones ready for any 'Elah' fallout\n |work= [[USA Today]]\n |first= Anthony\n |last= Breznican\n |date= 2007-09-11\n |access-date= 2008-03-09\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, freelance journalist [[Mark Boal]] wrote an article about Richard Davis's murder, entitled \"Death and Dishonor,\" published in ''[[Playboy]]''.
