It is a remake of Sluizer's 1988 French-Dutch [[The Vanishing (1988 film)|film of the same name]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2022}}\nThe film begins with chemistry professor Barney Cousins ([[Jeff Bridges]]) at his cabin, seemingly perfecting methods in which to conduct a successful kidnapping. He is so dedicated to his work that his wife Helene ([[Lisa Eichhorn]]) and his daughter Denise (Maggie Linderman) suspect he is having an affair.\n\nJeff Harriman ([[Kiefer Sutherland]]) goes on vacation with his girlfriend Diane Shaver ([[Sandra Bullock]]), who vanishes without a trace at a gas station. Three years later, Jeff has become obsessed with finding out what happened, posting fliers and following leads relentlessly. Exhausted, he stops at a diner and meets a waitress named Rita ([[Nancy Travis]]) who sympathizes with his plight and looks after him. A year later, the two are a couple and have settled in an apartment in Seattle. Jeff, who is attempting to write a novel, meets with a publisher who suggest that he write a book about the disappearance. Knowing this will upset Rita, he hides his project, buys a used military uniform at a surplus store and uses army reserve drills as a cover to continue his search. One weekend, Rita accesses Jeff's computerized rough draft of a children's book. After reading it, she discovers it's actually about Diane's disappearance. Rita tracks Jeff to his motel room and angrily confronts him. Jeff finally tells the truth about how Diane disappeared. Following Rita's ultimatum, Jeff abandons his search for Diane.\n\nSome months later, Barney is on campus and discovers Diane's missing posters covered with other fliers. He surmises that Jeff has given up his quest for the truth. He decides to bait Jeff by sending him a letter to meet him at a country club to learn the truth about Diane, which Jeff does. While Barney secretly watches, Rita confronts Jeff again and tells him they are done. Rita records an outgoing answering machine message at their home, indicating that she has broken up with Jeff. When Jeff returns, he changes the message without Rita knowing. Barney arrives at Jeff's door and admits that he was responsible for Diane's disappearance. Jeff attacks him and demands answers. Barney promises to show Jeff what happened to Diane, but only if he agrees to go through exactly the same thing she did. Barney explains about his past: he broke his arm after jumping off a roof when he was a child, and when he became a husband and father years later, he saved a little girl from drowning. He states that this experience lead him to an epiphany: With capability of great good also, could there come capability of great evil? The kidnapping of Diane was an attempt to answer that hypothesis.\n\nIn a short series of flashbacks, the build-up to the crime is shown: when Diane was in the gas station purchasing drinks for herself and Jeff, she asks Barney for a favor.  She then compliments a bracelet that Barney is wearing, which was given to him by his daughter.  Barney lies to Diane and claims to sell them, and then invites her to his car so she can buy one herself. In his car, Barney uses chloroform to subdue and kidnap her. Then Jeff is taken to the gas station where Diane went missing, and is told that if he drinks a cup of coffee which has been drugged, he will discover her fate by experiencing it. He does, and wakes up to find he has been buried alive in a coffin.\n\nRita calls home and listens to the changed outgoing message on the answering machine, which had incidentally recorded Barney's voice when he first confronted Jeff. Realizing that Jeff is in danger, she talks with the next door neighbor who witnessed the attack. She learns of Barney's identity and goes to his home and meets his daughter Denise. Not knowing the circumstances and on her way to meet a boy, Denise rides with Rita and gives her directions to her father's cabin. When Rita arrives, a violent fight ensues with Barney eventually gaining the upper hand. Barney offers Rita the same deal that he offers Jeff, but Rita outsmarts him. She lies to Barney and tells him that she has kidnapped Denise. She gets Barney to drink drugged coffee, but does not realize the drug takes 15 minutes to take effect. She goes in search of Jeff and finds a fresh mound of dirt. Believing that he has been buried alive, she digs him out, but is thwarted at the last minute by Barney. Jeff climbs out of the grave, kills Barney with the shovel, and embraces Rita. He sees another grave and finally accepts Diane's death. Jeff and Rita reunite as a couple and sell the story as a novel to a publishing company.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Barney Cousins\n* [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as Jeff Harriman\n* [[Nancy Travis]] as Rita Baker\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Diane Shaver\n* [[Park Overall]] as Lynn\n* Maggie Linderman (not to be confused with singer [[Maggie Lindemann]]) as Denise Cousins\n* [[Lisa Eichhorn]] as Helene Cousins\n* [[George Hearn]] as Arthur Bernard\n* [[Lynn Hamilton (actress)|Lynn Hamilton]] as Miss Carmichael\n\n==Production==\nPrincipal photography began on April 6, 1992. Filming took place in and around Washington State, including [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], where most of the film takes place. Locations in town includes the Seattle Yacht Club, the Pioneer Square Station, the Sur La Table at the Pike Place Market & the Aloha Street Apartments. The cabin by the lake at the beginning and for the final climax sequences at the end were filmed at Camp Omache near [[Monroe, Washington]]. The setting for the gas station where Diane goes missing, where Jeff waits by the car and where Jeff and Barney talk about Diane's fate was filmed at the Mountainside Shell Station at [[North Bend, Washington]]. The scene where Barney takes his family to the falls was filmed at Snoqualmie Falls at [[Snoqualmie, Washington]]. The second unit then went to Mount St. Helens to film the areas where Jeff and Diane go on their road trip. When filming was completed in Washington, the crew traveled to [[Cody, Wyoming]], to film the sequence of Jeff's car breaking down in the tunnel. They filmed it at the Cody Tunnel. Finally, they went to [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], to film the scene where Rita is at the pool hall and where Jeff first meets Rita at the restaurant. Filming wrapped on June 21, 1992.\n\n==Release==\n''The Vanishing'' was released in theatres on February 5, 1993, in 1,656 theatres.
