The screenplay by [[William A. Drake]] is based on the 1930 play of the same title by Drake, who had adapted it from the 1929 novel ''[[Grand Hotel (novel)|Menschen im Hotel]]'' by [[Vicki Baum]]. To date, it is the only film to have won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] without being nominated in any other category.\n\nThe film was remade as ''[[Week-End at the Waldorf]]'' in 1945, and also served as the basis for the 1989 Tony Award-winning stage musical ''[[Grand Hotel (musical)|Grand Hotel]]''. A movie musical remake, to take place at Las Vegas' [[MGM Grand Hotel & Casino|MGM Grand Hotel]], directed by [[Norman Jewison]], was considered in 1977, and again in 1981, but eventually fell through.<ref name=\"Vegas book\">{{cite book|last1=Rothman|first1=Hal|last2=Davis|first2=Mike|title=The Grit Beneath the Glitter: Tales from the Real Las Vegas|date=March 15, 2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520225381|pages=41\u201342|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwxU8dgsZJkC&q=%22grand+hotel%22&pg=PA382|access-date=February 5, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n''Grand Hotel'' has proven influential in the years since its original release.

Nothing ever happens\" \u2014 after which a great deal transpires.\n\nBaron Felix von Gaigern, who squandered his fortune and supports himself as a card player and occasional jewel thief, befriends Otto Kringelein, a dying accountant who has decided to spend his remaining days in the lap of luxury. Kringelein's former employer, industrialist General Director Preysing, is at the hotel to close an important deal, and he hires stenographer Flaemmchen to assist him. She aspires to be an actress and shows Preysing some magazine photos for which she posed.\n\nAnother guest is Russian [[Ballet|ballerina]] Grusinskaya, whose career is on the wane. When the Baron is in her room to steal her jewelry and she returns from the theatre, he hides in her room and overhears as she talks to herself about wanting to end it all. He comes out of hiding and engages her in conversation, and Grusinskaya finds herself attracted to him. He spends the night with her. The following morning, the Baron returns Grusinskaya's jewels, and she forgives his crime. She invites him to accompany her to [[Vienna]], an offer he accepts.\n\nThe Baron is desperate for money to pay his way out of the criminal group he has been working with. He and Kringelein get a card game going, and Kringelein wins everything, then becomes intoxicated. When he drops his wallet, the Baron stashes it in his pocket, intending to keep not only the winnings but the funds that will see Kringelein through the last weeks of his life. However, moved by the sight of  Kringelein\u2019s despair, the Baron \u2013 who desperately needs the money, but has become very fond of Kringelein \u2013 pretends to have discovered the wallet, and returns it to him.\n\nAs part of a desperate merger plan, Preysing must travel to England, and he asks Flaemmchen to accompany him. Later, when the two are in her room\u2014which opens onto his\u2014Preysing sees the shadow of the Baron rifling through his belongings. He confronts the Baron; the two struggle, and Preysing bludgeons the Baron with the telephone, killing him. Flaemmchen sees what happened and tells Kringelein, who confronts Preysing. He insists he acted in self-defense, but Kringelein summons the police, and Preysing is arrested.\n\nGrusinskaya departs for the train station, expecting to find the Baron waiting for her there. Meanwhile, Kringelein offers to take care of Flaemmchen, who suggests they seek a cure for his illness. As they leave the hotel, Doctor Otternschlag again observes, \"Grand Hotel. Always the same. People come. People go. Nothing ever happens.\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Grand Hotel (1932) - Trailer.webm|thumbtime=30|upright=1.0|thumb|right|[[:File:Grand Hotel (1932) - Trailer.webm|''Grand Hotel'' Trailer]].]]\n[[File:Grand Hotel lobby card.jpg|right|thumb|{{center|Lobby card}}]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Greta Garbo]] as Grusinskaya, the dancer\n* [[John Barrymore]] as Baron Felix von Gaigern\n* [[Joan Crawford]] as Flaemmchen, the stenographer\n* [[Wallace Beery]] as General Director Preysing\n* [[Lionel Barrymore]] as Otto Kringelein\n* [[Lewis Stone]] as Dr. Otternschlag\n* [[Jean Hersholt]] as Senf, the porter\n* [[Robert McWade]] as Meierheim\n* [[Purnell B.

It would also be filmed at the hotel, named for the film and opened just four years earlier, where MGM had not yet allowed any filming of its luxurious interiors. Goldman was very enthusiastic, since even though movie musicals were not very popular with studios or audiences at the time, he believed ''Grand Hotel'' could be an exception, recalling the classic Hollywood movie musicals of the 1940s and 1950s, with the real interiors of the Grand, never before seen on screen, as their setting. Goldman also worried that he was being seen too much as a screenwriter of thrillers and wanted to show that he was not a genre writer.<ref name=\"Adventures in the Screen Trade\">{{cite book |last1=Goldman |first1=William |author1-link=William Goldman |title=Adventures in the Screen Trade |date=1983 |publisher=[[Grand Central Publishing]] |location=New York, NY |isbn=9781455525461 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Adventures_in_the_Screen_Trade/qdNXo2952boC?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=william%20goldman%20norman%20jewison%20grand%20hotel |access-date=May 14, 2021}}</ref><ref name=\"Vegas book\" />\n\nMGM executives, initially cooperative, began to have second thoughts about the project once one of them remembered that Jewison had [[Final cut privilege|final cut]] in his contract, meaning the studio could not force him to make changes to the film before release. Goldman characterized their perception of the hotel as \"Pristine. Unsullied. The diamond in the Metro crown\", and believed they feared the film would not depict the Grand this way, instead focusing on the less glamorous aspects of Las Vegas. Goldman wrote a draft of the script with far more detail than he normally added to make clear that this was not his or Jewison's intention, but the studio was not sufficiently persuaded. As a compromise, they offered Jewison final cut on any material filmed outside the hotel, but not inside. Jewison was unwilling to accept that, and the project fell through.<ref name=\"Adventures in the Screen Trade\" />\n\nFour years later, Jewison called Goldman again and said the hotel, now under separate management from the studio, was again interested. Staff at the hotel took Goldman on tours of the building as part of his research. While visiting the suites on the uppermost floors, never rented but instead [[Comps (casino)|comped]] to heavy gamblers and their entourages, he was told that director [[Hal Ashby]] had used one for a scene in the then-unreleased ''[[Lookin' to Get Out]]'', apparently after [[Caesar's Palace]] across the street had refused him permission to use one of their suites.<ref name=\"Adventures in the Screen Trade\" />\n\nGoldman and Jewison learned that in the scene Ashby filmed at the Grand, one of the main characters goes into the suite to be [[fellatio|fellated]] by a prostitute while his friend waits outside. This was at odds with the image of the Grand management had gone to great lengths to avoid projecting in 1977. After the 1981 MGM film ''[[...All the Marbles]]'', set in the world of women's professional wrestling, staged its climax at the MGM Grand in [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], Goldman felt the Grand had lost its mystique and so lost his enthusiasm for working on the film; the project was dropped.<ref name=\"Adventures in the Screen Trade\" />\n\n==Home media==\n[[Warner Home Video]] released the first Region 1 DVD on February 3, 2004. The film is in 4:3 frame format, with audio tracks in English and French, and subtitles in English, French, and Spanish. Bonus features include ''Checking Out: Grand Hotel'', a documentary about the making of the film; a 1932 [[newsreel]] with highlights of the Hollywood premiere; ''Nothing Ever Happens'', a 1933 [[Vitaphone]] [[short film]] spoofing ''Grand Hotel''; and theatrical trailers.\n\nThe 2013 Warner Home Video Blu-ray release of ''Grand Hotel'' contains an audio commentary track by film historians [[Jeffrey Vance]] and Mark A.
