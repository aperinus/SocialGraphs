As of June 2020, this summary has 646 words: IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED NOT TO EXTEND THIS SUMMARY! -->\nIn a motel, Roy Tomlin and his friend Lucas watch an [[AMBER Alert]] for 8-year-old Alton Meyer and his reported abductor, Roy, while the boy reads on the floor.\n\nAt the Ranch, a [[Cult|religious cult]] in rural [[Texas]], Pastor Calvin Meyer dispatches two of his parishioners to retrieve Alton. He then faces his congregation as the FBI storms their church. [[NSA]] communications analyst Paul Sevier asks Calvin how numbers sent via encoded satellite transmissions made their way into his sermons. Calvin explains that Alton [[Glossolalia|speaks in tongues]] and gave the numbers to Calvin. As Alton's powers grew, his mother Sarah abandoned him, and members of the Ranch have been raising him, with Pastor Meyer as his adoptive father. It is also noted in this sequence that Roy is Alton's biological father. Roy is protective of Alton, doing everything in his power to avert danger.\n\nAfter a violent confrontation with a state trooper, Roy and Lucas seek cover at the home of Elden, a former Ranch member. During the night, an earthquake seems to wake Roy and Lucas. When they break down the door to Alton's room, they find him linked to Elden by blinding beams of light directly from his eyes into Elden's. Roy knocks out Elden and covers up Alton, who is extremely photosensitive. They take Elden's van and continue on toward a location that Alton specified. Members of the Ranch seem to know this location, but the FBI is desperately trying to figure out where the trio are headed.\n\nWhen they stop at a gas station, Alton seems to destroy a satellite, creating a rain of debris crashing down on them. They drive to Sarah Tomlin's house, and she is overjoyed to be reunited with her son. After they watch the news together, Alton explains that he caused the satellite to crash because the police were using it to track him.\n\nAs the fugitives (now including Sarah) continue on their trek, Alton appears to be growing sick and weak. He convinces Roy to let him see the daylight, while Lucas and Sarah go ahead to a motel. After witnessing his first ever sunrise, Alton's eyes begin to glow, and an enormous dome of light surrounds the duo. They reunite with Lucas and Sarah, and Alton is healthy. He explains that seeing the sun helped him realize his true identity. He explains that there is a world \"built on top of\" this one, and that he belongs to it. Roy confirms that he briefly saw this hidden world inside the dome of light.\n\nWhen they exit the hotel room, they are ambushed by Calvin's trackers from the ranch, who abduct Alton but are soon captured by the police. The boy is taken to a government facility where, although he had no normal way of knowing who the man was, he still insists that he will talk only to Paul Sevier. After Sevier experiences Alton's powers, he helps reunite him with his parents. Having deduced their destination from Calvin's sermons, Sevier warns the fugitives that there is a 5-mile security perimeter around the location, on the [[Florida panhandle]].\n\nRoy barrels through a roadblock, driving inside the perimeter as the Army scrambles to give chase. As they speed away, Alton lets them know just where to stop.  Alton and Sarah speedily exit the car and run into the woods. Roy and Lucas lead the Army on a wild goose chase while Alton and Sarah reach the edge of a swamp. There, a great dome of light appears, engulfing much of Florida and surrounding states.  Everyone inside the dome of light can see the futuristic structures of a parallel world. Eventually, other beings of this world gather around Alton, and the entire dome disappears, taking Alton with it.\n\nRoy and Lucas are arrested. Lucas is interviewed by the FBI. He tells them the story, but they are dissatisfied. Sevier then enters to interview him, with Lucas the only one aware of Sevier's previous involvement. Sarah, apparently walking away from her past life forever, cuts off her cult-traditionalist hair braid in a local gas station. Roy is incarcerated, but can watch the sunrise.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Roy Tomlin\n* [[Joel Edgerton]] as Lucas\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Sarah Tomlin\n* [[Adam Driver]] as Paul Sevier\n* [[Jaeden Martell]] as Alton\n* [[Sam Shepard]] as Pastor Calvin Meyer\n* [[Bill Camp]] as Doak\n* [[Scott Haze]] as Levi\n* [[Paul Sparks]] as Agent Miller\n* David Jensen as Elden\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] commenced on January 20, 2014,<ref>{{cite web| url= http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2013/08/07/jeff-nichols-midnight-special-interview|title=Jeff Nichols, The Director Of 'Mud', Talks About His New Sci-Fi Movie, 'Midnight Special'|work=MTV|date=August 7, 2013|accessdate=August 17, 2013|last=Sullivan|first=Kevin}}</ref> and took place for 40 days in [[New Orleans]], wrapping on March 1, 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://louisianaentertainment.gov/index.php/film/production-hotline | title=PRODUCTION HOTLINE | website= louisianaentertainment.gov| accessdate=March 10, 2014}}</ref> The film was produced by [[Sarah Green (film producer)|Sarah Green]] and Brian Kavanaugh-Jones, with Glen Basner and [[Christos V.
