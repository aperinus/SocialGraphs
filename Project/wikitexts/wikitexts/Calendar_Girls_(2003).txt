When Annie's husband, John, is diagnosed with terminal [[leukaemia]], Chris regularly visits them at the hospital.\n\nChris complains about the uncomfortable couch in the waiting room. After noticing a \"girlie\" calendar in a local mechanics shop, she hits upon an idea to raise funds to buy a new sofa. She proposes producing a calendar featuring members of the Knapely branch of the Women's Institute discreetly posing nude while engaged in traditional WI activities, such as baking and knitting.\n\nChris's proposal initially is met with skepticism, but she eventually convinces nine additional women to participate in the project with her and Annie. They enlist Lawrence, a hospital worker and amateur photographer, to help with the project. The women are all quite shy, but they support each other, overcoming their fears.\n\nThe head of the local Women's Institute branch refuses to sanction the calendar, so Chris and Annie plead their case to the national congress of the Women's Institute in [[London]]. They are told the final decision rests with the local leader, who grudgingly agrees to the calendar's sale.\n\nThe initial printing of 500 quickly sells out and gains national and international media attention. The women are invited, all expenses paid, to appear on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' in [[Los Angeles]]. Initially Chris is convinced to not go, to watch after her troubled teen by Annie, but a scandalous story about her in a gossip rag by a paparazzi-journalist causes her to follow them to L.A.\n\nThe publicity surrounding the calendar eventually takes a toll on their personal lives and, during a photo shoot, tension boils over, Chris and Annie angrily clash. Annie accuses Chris of ignoring her husband and son and the demands of the family business in favour of newfound celebrity; Chris believes Annie revels in her [[Mother Teresa]]-like status of catering to the ill and bereaved who have bombarded her with fan mail.\n\nAll is resolved eventually, and the women resume their normal, pre-calendar lives.\n\nBefore the credits, it is shown that they made over half a million pounds with the calendars and with the proceeds built a special leukemia wing on their local hospital.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as Chris Harper, the driving force behind the idea of stripping off for the local [[Women's Institute]] calendar. \n* [[Julie Walters]] as Annie Clarke, Chris's best friend whose husband John's [[leukaemia|leukemia]] death serves as the basis for her friend's idea to purchase a sofa for hospital visitors in remembrance of him. \n* [[Linda Bassett]] as Cora, a shop owner and divorced single mother. She is the official organist of the Knapely WI.\n* [[Annette Crosbie]] as Jessie, a retired teacher.\n* [[Celia Imrie]] as Celia, a major's wife.\n* [[Penelope Wilton]] as Ruth Reynoldson, a carpet dealer's housewife.

During his illness, Baker's friends began to raise money, initially with the aim of purchasing a sofa for the visitors' lounge in the hospital where John was treated. Nothing could have prepared them for the way their original calendar took off. To date, they have raised over \u00a33 million for [[Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research]], the UK's leading blood cancer charity.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bloodwise.org.uk/page/calendar-girls |title=The Calendar Girls story |access-date=11 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127030059/https://bloodwise.org.uk/page/calendar-girls |archive-date=27 November 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe photos for the 2000 Alternative WI Calendar, as it was named, were taken by Terry Logan, a former professional photographer who was married to one of the models. It was released on 12 April 1999 and became a runaway success, selling out in the first week. 10,000 additional copies were printed, all of which were sold within three weeks.

Screenwriter Juliette Towhidi first came across the story when she was shown an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'', and she straight away took the idea to producer Suzanne Mackie. The two of them had been discussing ideas for a female-driven film for a while, and this struck them as the perfect project. They travelled up to Yorkshire together to meet the women, and were able to secure life story rights in the face of fierce competition, including from Hollywood. Towhidi then worked on multiple drafts of the screenplay, getting to know the women and developing the script over several years. In this time the film's working title switched from 'Calendar Girls' to 'Jam and Jerusalem' and back again. A first director was attached, but when he dropped out, so [[Nigel Cole]], known for his screen debut ''[[Saving Grace (2000 film)|Saving Grace]]'' starring [[Brenda Blethyn]], was brought on board, quickly followed by screenwriter [[Tim Firth]], who took over writing duties from Towhidi and worked on rewrites of the script up until production.\n\nCole reached out to [[Julie Walters]] and [[Helen Mirren]] to play the lead roles in the film.

But even humble plastic-wrapped cheese has its virtues and so does this film [...] Chief among those graces are Helen Mirren and Julie Walters, two well-matched and criminally underused actresses [...] Although they have little to do but grin and bare it, Mirren and Walters are delightful company.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/dargis/cl-et-manohla19dec19,0,2184596.story |title=''Calendar Girls'' \u2013 Movie Review |author=Manohla Dargis |author-link=Manohla Dargis |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=19 December 2003 |access-date=1 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617141259/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/dargis/cl-et-manohla19dec19%2C0%2C2184596.story |archive-date=17 June 2009  }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Lisa Schwarzbaum, who graded the film B+, compared ''Calendar Girls'' with other British comedy films such as ''[[Billy Elliot]]'' and ''[[Saving Grace (2000 film)|Saving Grace]]''. She commented that \"[It] is the first export from the light-comedy-steamroller division of the British film industry that avoids, for the most part, the kind of queasy class condescension such hell-bent charmers have relied on since unemployed steel-mill workers shook their groove thangs in ''The Full Monty''.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,568536,00.html |title=''Calendar Girls'' {{!}} Movie Review |author=Lisa Schwarzbaum |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=29 December 2003 |access-date=1 June 2009 }}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' critic Derek Elley wrote that the film \"delivers very likable, if sometimes dramatically wobbly, results\". He found that \"though the film is never dull, and playing by the cast is spirited, it's actually a surprisingly gentle movie [...] The humor has a typically British, offhanded flavor, and the essentially simple story plays more as a multi-character rondo on a single idea. For every laugh-out-loud moment, or eccentric touch, there are equal moments of reflection and pause [...] Despite an uncertain start in establishing a consistent comic tone, pic builds into an engaging, light character comedy, played somewhere between the [[Ealing Studios|Ealing]] tradition and contempo regional comedy.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117921510 |title=Theater Review: ''Calendar Girls'' |author=David Benedict |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=18 September 2008 |access-date=2022-02-02 }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Guardian]]'', Peter Bradshaw rated the film three out of a possible five stars and added, \"This genial comedy, directed by Nigel Cole, with an excellent, tightly constructed script by Tim Firth and Juliette Towhidi, accentuates the positive.

When it fails, it is the film's acknowledgment of its own big-screen inevitability that is to blame. The result is half a great British screen comedy, twice as much as one usually expects from the genre nowadays ... Ultimately, however, this remains an immensely likeable and often impressive romp.\"<ref name=\"guardian\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Award \n! Category \n! Recipient(s) \n!
