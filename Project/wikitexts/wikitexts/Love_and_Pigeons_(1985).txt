An elderly couple lives next door to the Kuzyakins \u2014 baba Shura ([[Natalya Tenyakova]]) and uncle Mitya ([[Sergey Yursky]]), in whose family there are also constant conflicts. Uncle Mitya is a bit of an alcoholic, but his wife tries to keep him in a tight grip. Therefore, he uses every opportunity to drink secretly from his strict wife (for example, he arranges an impromptu funeral feast for her, although she did not die).\n\nOne day Vasily gets an industrial injury and leaves on a trip to the seaside for treatment. At the resort, he meets Raisa Zakharovna ([[Lyudmila Gurchenko]]), an employee of the personnel department of the forestry enterprise in which Vasily works. This city dweller, a flighty and exalted lady, fascinates Vasily with her amazing stories about psychics, telekinesis, astral bodies and humanoids. They have a holiday romance going on.\n\nAs a result, Vasily leaves the family for his new lover, which they tell his wife and children about together in a letter. After reading the letter, Nadezhda has a tantrum. On the same stormy evening, Raisa Zakharovna herself pays a visit to the Kuzyakins, thinking to find a common language and settle everything in peace. Raisa tells Nadezhda that she is an employee of the personnel department, and at first does not give details. The overwrought Nadezhda talks to her about her errant husband, but after finding out who she is, causes a scandal and rushes at her with his fists. The battered Raisa leaves with nothing.\n\nAfter that, Nadezhda sinks into depression and is about to die. The children are also offended by their father, especially Lyonka, who threatens to kill him as soon as he sees him. At the same time, the life together of Raisa and Vasily does not work out, because they are people of \"different social strata\", in addition, Vasily misses his family. As a result, he leaves Raisa. His family does not accept him, so the main character is forced to live in a hut on the riverbank.\n\nAfter a while, Nadezhda, realizing that Vasily cheated on her largely because she got a nasty temper, forgives him. She also stops reproaching her husband for his hobby \u2014 pigeons. Fearing a negative reaction from Lyonka and the villagers, they meet secretly, but two months later, after learning that Nadezhda is pregnant, Vasily returns home. The return takes place against the background of the upcoming departure of his son to the army.\n\n== Production ==\n* The play and the film are based on the real story of the family of Vasily and Nadezhda Kuzyakin, who lived in the homeland of the author of the script of the film Vladimir Gurkin \u2014 in the city of [[Cheremkhovo]] ([[Irkutsk region]]). The prototypes of Mitya and Shura were Gurkin's grandparents.\n* [[Vladimir Menshov]] saw the play quite by accident. When he saw Nina Doroshina playing the role of Nadya in the [[Sovremennik Theatre|Sovremennik theatre]] he decided to make a movie.\n* Shura \u2013 Natalya Tenyakova and Mitya - [[Sergei Yursky]] are husband and wife in real life.\n* Alexander Mikhailov initially refused the role.
