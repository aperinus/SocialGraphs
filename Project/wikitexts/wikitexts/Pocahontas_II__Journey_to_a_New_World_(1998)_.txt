While the first film dealt with her meeting with John Smith and the arrival of the British settlers in Jamestown, the sequel focuses on [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]]'s journey to England with John Rolfe to negotiate for peace between the two nations, although her death is omitted from the film's ending.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[London]], [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] is ambushed by a group of soldiers with a warrant for his arrest and presumed dead in the ensuing confrontation; [[John Ratcliffe (governor)|Governor Ratcliffe]] has lied to [[James VI and I|King James]] (being a personal friend of the King) and framed Smith as the traitor from the first film in a plot to declare war against the [[Powhatan]] Nation and get hold of the gold he still believes them to possess, all while avoiding punishment for his own crimes. In order to prevent war, the King sends a young diplomat, [[John Rolfe]], to bring [[Chief Powhatan]] to England for negotiations. In the New World, [[Pocahontas]], Powhatan's daughter, mourns John Smith's death but is eventually able to move on. John Rolfe soon arrives, greeted by English civilians (who by now have settled in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]]) and a curious Pocahontas. Rolfe eventually speaks with Powhatan, but he refuses to accompany him to England, so Pocahontas goes in her father's stead, believing that she can bring about peace between the two nations. Powhatan sends a bodyguard, Uttamatomakkin (Uti) to accompany Pocahontas. Rolfe and Pocahontas have a rocky start, but gradually warm up to each other.\n\nIn England, Rolfe leaves Pocahontas at his mansion and meets with King James and [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]], but James refuses to meet with Pocahontas despite Rolfe's pleas. Instead, per Ratcliffe's suggestion, James invites both Rolfe and Pocahontas to an upcoming ball and promises that if Pocahontas impresses him by acting \"civilised\", he will prevent the armada from sailing to Jamestown, but if she does not, he will declare war. Knowing that Ratcliffe deliberately manipulated the King, Rolfe and his maid, Mrs. Jenkins, educate Pocahontas in the ways of British etiquette to prepare her. At the ball, Pocahontas wins over the King and Queen with flattery and almost manages to prevent war, but a bear-baiting arranged by Ratcliffe and greatly enjoyed by the snobbish nobility infuriates Pocahontas and she openly accuses the King of savage behaviour. With Ratcliffe whispering in his ear, James angrily orders Pocahontas and Uti imprisoned in the Tower of London, and declares war on the Powhatan tribe.\n\nAt his home, a despondent Rolfe is approached by a hooded stranger who helps him break Pocahontas and Uti out of the tower and take them to an inn, where the man reveals himself to be John Smith. Smith implores Pocahontas to stay hidden with him, but she instead takes Rolfe's advice and decides to try and stop the war one last time. She openly confronts the King in the palace and reveals Smith, thus proving that Ratcliffe had been lying the entire time. Realizing Ratcliffe's treachery, James sends a battalion (among them Pocahontas, Smith, Rolfe, Uti, and their animal friends) to stop the armada and detain Ratcliffe. They are successful in stopping the ships before they can set sail, but Ratcliffe refuses to give up and tries to kill Pocahontas. Smith appears and fights Ratcliffe one-on-one until Ratcliffe draws a gun, but before he can fire, Rolfe hits him overboard with the ship's mast. Ratcliffe makes it back to the port, where he is arrested by the King.\n\nSmith receives a royal pardon and his own ship from the King as a sign of apology. Pocahontas and Rolfe, meanwhile, appear on the verge of admitting that they love each other. Before they can, Smith appears and implores Pocahontas to accompany him on his new journeys around the world, but Pocahontas chooses otherwise and she and Smith part ways as friends. As Pocahontas later prepares to return to Jamestown, she finds Rolfe waiting for her on the ship, having chosen to go and live with her in Jamestown (with Uti remaining in London in his stead). They kiss as the ship sails into the sunset.\n\n==Voice Cast==\n* [[Irene Bedard]] ([[Judy Kuhn]] singing) as '''[[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]]''': the main character. Desiring everlasting peace between England and her people, she travels to London as a diplomat, falling in love with John Rolfe on the way.\n* [[Billy Zane]] as '''[[John Rolfe]]''': the diplomat sent to bring Chief Powhatan to England and who falls in love with Pocahontas to the point that he stands up against Ratcliffe and King James.\n* [[Donal Gibson]] as '''[[John Smith (explorer)|Captain John Smith]]''': Pocahontas's one time love, presumed dead after a confrontation with Ratcliffe. He later resurfaces to aid Pocahontas and John Rolfe against Ratcliffe. Gibson replaces his older brother, [[Mel Gibson|Mel]], who voiced Smith in the first film.\n* [[David Ogden Stiers]] as '''[[John Ratcliffe (governor)|Governor Ratcliffe]]''': the main villain. Having lied to King James about the events in Jamestown, Ratcliffe becomes more determined than ever to go to war with the Powhatans in order to find his falsely speculated treasure. Due to his friendship and influence over the King, Ratcliffe is the ruler of England in all but name.\n* [[John Kassir]] as '''Meeko''': Pocahontas's pet raccoon, ever looking for fun.\n* [[Russell Means]] as '''[[Chief Powhatan]]''': Pocahontas's father and chief of the Powhatans. He refuses to travel to England, so Pocahontas goes in his stead.\n* [[Frank Welker]] as '''Flit''': Pocahontas's hummingbird friend, now warmer towards strangers than before.\n* [[Linda Hunt]] as '''Grandmother Willow''': Pocahontas's spiritual guardian. She advises Pocahontas to go to England for peace.\n* Danny Mann as '''Percy''': once Ratcliffe's pet dog, now living with Pocahontas and Meeko in Jamestown.\n* [[Michelle St. John]] as '''Nakoma''': Pocahontas's best friend, now married to a Powhatan who somewhat resembles Kocoum.\n* [[Jim Cummings]] as '''[[James VI and I|King James]]''': King of England. While well-meaning, he is portrayed as a simple-minded buffoon who is very easily manipulated by Ratcliffe.\n* [[Finola Hughes]] as '''[[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]]''': James's wife, somewhat more intelligent and open than her husband.\n* [[Jean Stapleton]] as '''Mrs. Jenkins''': John Rolfe's well-meaning housemaid.\n* [[Brad Garrett]] as '''[[Tomocomo|Uttamatomakkin]]''': Pocahontas's bodyguard, sent by Powhatan to watch over her. His nickname is \"Uti\".\n\n== Production ==\nProduction took two years and occurred in the United States, Japan, and Canada.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-aug-20-ca-14696-story.html|title=Pocahontas, Re-Revisited|last=King|first=Susan|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 20, 1998|access-date=May 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an [[approval rating]] of 29% based on 7 reviews and an average rating of 4.4/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pocahontas_ii_journey_to_a_new_world/|title=Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World (1998)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=April 10, 2018}}</ref>  Joe Leydon of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it \"too bland and formulaic\" for adults but said that children will likely enjoy it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1998/film/reviews/pocahontas-ii-journey-to-a-new-world-1200454543/|title=Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World | first=Joe| last=Leydon| work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=August 31, 1998|access-date=May 18, 2020}}</ref>  ''[[TV Guide]]'' rated the film 2/5 stars.
