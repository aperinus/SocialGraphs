[[Chevy Chase]] and [[Demi Moore]] star as [[yuppies]] who are taken to court for speeding in the bizarre, financially bankrupt small town of Valkenvania. Aykroyd co-stars as the town's 106-year-old [[judge]], Alvin Valkenheiser, who holds a personal grudge against financiers, and [[John Candy]] has a supporting role as Valkenheiser's grandson, chief of police Dennis Valkenheiser. [[Tupac Shakur]] made his acting debut in this film, as a member of the rap group [[Digital Underground]]. The film's tone was compared by critics to films such as ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' series and ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', as well as ''[[The Munsters]]''. The film's humor was described as being derived from [[sketch comedy]] and [[gross-out humor]].\n\nProduction commenced in 1990 under the title ''Git'', which was changed in production to ''Valkenvania''. Subsequently, prior to the film's release, [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Bros.]] changed the title to ''Nothing but Trouble''; in a press statement released in December 1990, Aykroyd said that he preferred the ''Valkenvania'' title. Upon release, the film received generally negative reviews from critics, with criticism directed at its humor, screenplay, tone, and direction. Aykroyd would go on to receive a [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor|Worst Supporting Actor]] [[Golden Raspberry Award|Razzie]] at the [[12th Golden Raspberry Awards]]. It was later called an underrated comedy.\n\n== Plot ==\nWhile hosting a party in his [[Manhattan]] penthouse, financial publisher Chris Thorne ([[Chevy Chase]]) meets lawyer Diane Lightson ([[Demi Moore]]) and agrees to escort her to consult a client in [[Atlantic City]] the following day. Thorne's clients, obnoxious but wealthy Brazilian siblings Fausto and Renalda Squiriniszu ([[Taylor Negron]] and [[Bertila Damas]]), meet up with them and invite themselves along. Chris takes a detour off of the [[New Jersey Turnpike]], ultimately ending up in the run-down village of Valkenvania. After running a stop sign and subsequently attempting to escape pursuing officer Dennis Valkenheiser ([[John Candy]]), the group is captured and taken before his 106-year-old grandfather [[Judge]] Alvin Valkenheiser ([[Dan Aykroyd]]). After Chris offends the judge, the [[yuppies]] are locked in a hidden room under the courthouse to be judged the next day, and they overhear the judge violently executing a group of convicted drug dealers in a deadly [[roller coaster]] nicknamed \"Mr. Bonestripper\". Chris, Diane and the Brazilians attend the judge's dinner, learning that the Judge is holding them there as retribution for a coal deal which the Valkenheiser family blames for their poverty. The group attempts an escape, but Alvin's mute granddaughter Eldona (Candy, in a dual role) captures Chris and Diane. Meanwhile, after being chased by Dennis' trigger-happy cousin, Miss Purdah, the Brazilians escape by cutting a deal with Dennis, who decides to escape with them.\n\nThe Judge holds Chris and Diane hostage, but they eventually escape, get lost through hidden hallways and slides and become separated. Escaping into the property's salvage yard, Diane meets and befriends the judge's severely deformed grandchildren, Bobo (played by Aykroyd) and Lil' Debbull (played by John Daveikis), who are barred from living in the house. However, she also notices Eldona destroying Chris's [[BMW 7 Series (E23)|BMW 733i]]. The Judge catches Chris sneaking into his personal quarters and punishes him per house policy, which decrees that Chris must marry Eldona. Meanwhile, in the court room, [[Digital Underground]] is being held on charges of speeding, but the Judge releases them after being charmed by an impromptu rap performance. He also asks them to stay as witnesses for the wedding, which Chris reluctantly goes through with in exchange for his life, but is later caught pleading with the band to help him escape. The band leaves without understanding him, and the Judge furiously sentences Chris to die in \"Mr. Bonestripper\". The machine breaks down just before Chris is fed into it, and he escapes. The Judge nearly kills Diane with another claw contraption known as the Gradertine, but Chris retrieves her at the last second and the two jump on a freight train back to New York. After the two report their plight to the authorities, local and state police raid the Judge's courthouse. Chris and Diane are asked to accompany the officers to the site, only to find out that the officers involved are fully aware of and allied with the Judge. The couple escapes when the area's underground coal fires cause a colossal [[earthquake]], fatally destroying the town. Back in New York, Chris sees the judge on television, brandishing Chris's driver's license, announcing that he and his family plan to move in with his new grandson-in-law, causing Chris to comically flee for his life.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|<!-- Cast is in credits order and named as credit; please do not change. -->\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Chris Thorne\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Judge Alvin \"J.P\" Valkenheiser / Bobo\n* [[John Candy]] as Officer Dennis Valkenheiser / Eldona Valkenheiser\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Diane Lightson\n* [[Valri Bromfield]] as Miss Purdah\n* [[Taylor Negron]] as Fausto Squiriniszu\n* [[Bertila Damas]] as Renalda Squiriniszu\n* [[Raymond J.

Weiss]] attended with Dan and Peter Aykroyd. Weiss had a fractured rib and suggested the three attend a film to take his mind off his injury, but that it couldn't be a comedy because it hurt him to laugh, which is why the Aykroyd brothers chose a horror film. Once the movie started and the three saw the audience laughing at the film, Weiss suggested that they make a horror-comedy together, since audiences wanted to laugh and be scared at the same time. Peter Aykroyd related an event in which Dan had been pulled over for speeding in upstate New York and was taken to the justice of the peace to stand trial in what Dan referred to as a \"kangaroo court\", and after he was fined $50, the justice of the peace invited Dan to stay for tea, and he ended up staying there for four hours. It was suggested that a horror story be developed based on this event, and Aykroyd spent 6 months writing it as a screenplay titled ''Git'', which was later changed to ''Road to Ruin''; Dan Aykroyd described the script as \"a monster movie\" and compared it to ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' and ''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre''. Much of the script's bizarre characters and events, such as the giant mutant babies, were based on a series of dreams Aykroyd was having, and he set the story in the fictional town of Valkenvania, which was based loosely on the town of [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"goodbadflicks\">{{cite AV media |title= Exploring Nothing but Trouble - The Untold Story Behind Dan Aykroyd's Notorious Production |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TFfL1aUDaQ  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211222/8TFfL1aUDaQ |archive-date=2021-12-22 |url-status=live|via= [[YouTube]] }}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nAykroyd offered the script to [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]], who was interested in the story, but ultimately turned it down because he only directed his own scripts.
