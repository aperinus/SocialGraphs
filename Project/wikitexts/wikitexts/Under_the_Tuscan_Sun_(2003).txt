Based on [[Frances Mayes]]' 1996 memoir [[Under the Tuscan Sun (book)|of the same name]], the film is about a recently divorced writer who buys a villa in Tuscany on a whim, hoping it will lead to a change in her life.<ref name=\"imdb\">{{cite web|title=Under the Tuscan Sun |date=26 September 2003 |publisher=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328589/ |access-date=March 20, 2012}}</ref> The film was nominated for the [[Art Directors Guild]] Excellence in Production Design Award, and Diane Lane received a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination for her performance.<ref name=\"imdbawards\">{{cite web |title=Awards for Under the Tuscan Sun |publisher=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328589/awards |access-date=March 20, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nFrances Mayes is a [[San Francisco]] writer whose seemingly perfect life takes an unexpected turn when she learns that her husband has been cheating on her. The husband, who had been working on his writing and had no income, ironically, was allowed to petition for alimony. As a one-time settlement, however, the agreement was for Frances to quit claim her 1/2 ownership of the home. The divorce\u2014and the loss of her house to her ex-husband and his much-younger, pregnant new partner\u2014leaves her depressed and unable to write. Her best friend Patti, who is expecting a child with her girlfriend Grace, is worried that Frances might never recover from the traumatic divorce. She urges Frances to take an Italian vacation to [[Tuscany]] using the ticket she purchased before she became pregnant. At first, Frances refuses, but after another depressing day in her gloomy temporary apartment, she decides that it's a good idea to get away for a while.\n\nIn Tuscany, her tour group stops in the small town of [[Cortona]]. After wandering through the charming streets, she notices a posting for a [[villa]] for sale in Cortona. She rejoins her tour group on the bus, and just outside town, the bus stops to allow a flock of sheep to cross the road. While they wait, Frances realizes that they've stopped directly in front of the very villa that she had seen for sale\u2014something she believes is a sign. She asks the driver to stop, and she gets off the bus. Through a series of serendipitous events, she becomes the owner of a lovely yet dilapidated villa in beautiful Tuscany.\n\nFrances begins her new life with the help of a variety of interesting characters and unusual but gentle souls. She hires a crew of [[Poland|Polish]] [[immigrants]] to renovate the house. Over time, Frances also befriends her Italian neighbors and develops relationships with her Polish workers, the realtor who sold her the villa, and Katherine, an eccentric aging [[British people|British]] actress who evokes the mystery and beauty of an Italian film star. Later, she is visited by the now very pregnant Patti, whose partner Grace has left her.\n\nFrances meets and has a brief romantic affair with Marcello, but their relationship does not last. She is about to give up on happiness when one of her Polish workers, a teenager named Pawel, and a neighbor's young daughter come to her for help. Her father does not approve of him, due to his being Polish and not having a family, yet they are very much in love and want to get married. Frances persuades the girl's family to support their love, by proclaiming that she is Pawel's family, and the young lovers are soon married at the villa. During the wedding celebration, Ed, an American writer appears unexpectedly. The writer, whose novel Frances had previously edited and critiqued harshly, is traveling in Tuscany and heard about her residence there. Their attraction for each other points to a romantic future.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Diane Lane]] as Frances Mayes\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as Patti\n* [[Lindsay Duncan]] as Katherine\n* [[Raoul Bova]] as Marcello\n* [[Vincent Riotta]] as Martini\n* [[Mario Monicelli]] as Old man with flowers\n* [[Roberto Nobile]] as Placido\n* [[Anita Zagaria]] as Fiorella\n* Evelina Gori as Nona Cardinale\n* [[Kate Walsh (actor)|Kate Walsh]] as Grace\n* [[Pawel Szajda]] as Pawel\n* [[David Sutcliffe]] as Ed\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Lawyer (uncredited)\n* Giulia Steigerwalt as Chiara\n* [[Valentine Pelka]] as Jerzy\n* Sasa Vulicevic as Zbigniew\n* Massimo Sarchielli as Nino\n* [[Claudia Gerini]] as Signora Raguzzi\n* Laura Pestellini as Contessa\n* Don McManus as Nasty Man\n* [[Matt Salinger]] as Colleague\n* [[Elden Henson]] as Author\n* [[Jack Kehler]] as Apartment Manager\n* Kristoffer Ryan Winters as David Tour Guide\n* Nuccio Siano as Gianni\n* Malva Guicheney as Gianni's Daughter<ref name=\"imdbcastfull\">{{cite web|title=Full cast and crew for Under the Tuscan Sun|website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328589/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast |access-date=Dec 22, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Dan Bucatinsky]] as Rodney<ref name=\"imdbcastfull\"/>\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn November 1998, producer Tom Sternberg was filming the psychological thriller ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'' (1999) in [[Northern Italy]].<ref name=\"madeinatlantis\">{{cite web|title=Under the Tuscan Sun Production Notes (2003) |website=madeinatlantis.com |url=https://madeinatlantis.com/movies_central/2003/tuscan_production_details.htm |access-date=March 3, 2021}}</ref> In the penultimate week of its seventeen-week shooting schedule, the crew was working in the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] town of [[Pienza]] in the [[province of Siena]].<ref name=\"madeinatlantis\"/> After finishing the shooting day, Sternberg, director [[Anthony Minghella]] and actor [[Matt Damon]] met [[Frances Mayes]] and her husband Ed at a nearby wine bar where the couple was picking out wine glasses.<ref name=\"madeinatlantis\"/> Astounded to meet the author, Sternberg had read Mayes's 1996 memoir ''[[Under the Tuscan Sun (book)|Under the Tuscan Sun]]'' a year earlier but initially not considered it for film treatment.<ref name=\"madeinatlantis\"/> In March 2000, Sternberg met Mayes again in [[Los Angeles]], where they were guests of the [[Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism|Tuscan Film Commission]].<ref name=\"madeinatlantis\"/> Upon their reencounter, Sternberg reread the book and realized its potential as a film.<ref name=\"madeinatlantis\"/> Sternberg and executive producer Mark Gill gave the book to [[Audrey Wells]] and asked to hear her take on how to adapt it for the screen.
