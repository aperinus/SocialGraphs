It was released April 20, 2007, by the distributor [[Screen Gems]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn their way home from a family party, David and Amy Fox, who are on the verge of divorce, take a wrong turn on a remote mountain road. They drive to an old auto repair garage after their car breaks down. A mechanic helps to fix it. Soon after leaving, their car breaks down again. When they find that there is no [[cell phone reception]], they walk back to the garage, only to find it has swiftly closed. They walk to a nearby motel to seek help. When they arrive at the reception office, they hear a piercing scream coming from the room at the back of the reception, only for it to be coming from the television. The motel manager, Mason turns it off and meets the couple. He explains the auto repair garage across the street is closed until the morning, so they book a room for the night.\n\nWhile getting ready for bed, David and Amy are alarmed by loud banging on their door and the door to the adjacent room. David goes to reception to tell Mason about the situation, and Mason tells them they are his only guests. Back in the room, David watches a videotape that was left in the room's TV. At first it seems to be a horror film, but then they realize it is a [[snuff film]] that was made in their room. David searches the room and finds multiple hidden [[security cameras]] and realizes that Mason is watching them.\n\nDavid and Amy flee the room for the woods, but are confronted by two men wearing masks, so they return to the room and lock the door. In the bathroom, they are shocked to find the half-eaten apple Amy left in the car. David runs to the motel's [[payphone]] and dials 911, but Mason answers. David escapes the [[phone booth]] just before the men crash their car into it and chase him back to the room. Moments later, David and Amy hear a truck pull into the parking lot. From the window, they attract the driver's attention, but soon realize he is working with Mason. They then discover a trapdoor in the bathroom, leading to various tunnels to different rooms of the motel. They end up in the manager's room. Amy attempts to call the police but is interrupted by Mason.\n\nFollowed by the masked men, they sneak back into the tunnel and take a different route, ending up in the auto garage across from the motel. Meanwhile, a sheriff appears, having responded to Amy's attempted call. Upon searching one of the rooms, he witnesses a snuff film and flees. David and Amy run to him, and they all attempt to leave but find the engine wire to the police car has been cut. When the officer gets out, the masked men kill him. David and Amy run into one of the other rooms. David hides Amy in the ceiling while he plans to make it to Mason's office to retrieve a revolver, but the men stab him as he leaves. He collapses as Amy watches from above.\n\nIn the morning, Amy comes down and leaves, finding one of the killers' car. As she attempts to drive away, a masked man breaks into the car from the sun roof, and she crashes the car into the motel, killing two of the men. (The latter of which is revealed to be the mechanic who \"helped\" the couple earlier.) Amy then runs into the reception, where she finds the revolver. Mason appears and begins to strangle her with the telephone cord, then beats her as he records the struggle with his video camera. Amy fights back and manages to gain the upper hand, finally shooting Mason dead.\n\nAmy returns to David and finds he is still alive. She goes back to reception, takes the phone cord from Mason's jacket pocket, and connects it to the phone to call 911. She then goes back to David, comforting him while waiting for the police to arrive.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Luke Wilson]] as David Fox\n*[[Kate Beckinsale]] as Amy Fox\n*[[Frank Whaley]] as Mason\n*[[Ethan Embry]] as the Mechanic\n*Scott G.

In its second week, the film had a 45.9% drop-off, falling to a #8 position. The film has grossed a total of $35.3 million worldwide.<ref name=mojo/>\n\n===Home video===\n''Vacancy'' was released on DVD on August 14, 2007, in both fullscreen and anamorphic widescreen, with Dolby Digital 5.1 audio. Special features include [[deleted scene]]s, a making-of featurette, the full versions of the [[snuff film]]s, and a trailer gallery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/29664/vacancy/|title=Vacancy|last=Jane|first=Ian|work=[[DVD Talk]]|date=2007-08-07|access-date=2015-12-22}}</ref> It was also released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] and [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] for the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]]. Many versions shipped to Australia featured Sony DVD \"anti-piracy\" technology, which led to them being unreadable on most DVD players, including Sony DVD players. The DVD featured a commentary by Nimrod Antal, Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson, all of whom said they thought the film was a great addition to the horror genre and for not using gore for scares but using psychological horror.\n\n===Advertising and promotion===\nThe advertising strategy for the film made use of the [[Internet]] as well as a toll-free phone number. In addition to the TV spots and trailers shown in theaters and on television, the toll free number was made to sound as if one is actually calling the motel in which the film is set. In the background, screaming can be heard accompanying the voice of the proprietor, who informs callers about \"slashing\" prices and the \"killer\" deals that the motel has\u2014if it has a vacancy. The voice of the proprietor is Frank Whaley's. As of August 7, 2015, the toll-free phone number is no longer valid.\n\n==Reception==\n[[review aggregator|Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 55% of 123 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.4/10.

There's no agenda in ''Vacancy'' other than to keep you in a state of nervous collapse for 85 minutes\", and he criticized the film's ending, which he called \"a disappointment\", writing, \"I don't know when I've seen a thriller this unpretentiously well-crafted sputter to so inconsequential an end.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Burr |first=Ty |date=2007-04-20 |title=Vacancy leaves room for terror |url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2007/04/20/vacancy_leaves_room_for_terror/ |url-status=live |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=Boston.com}}</ref>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Guardian]]'', feature writer Rob Mackie favorably compared the film's opening to \"classic-period Hitchcock, and ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in particular\", writing, \"What makes Nimrod Antal's film genuinely scary and gripping is that the script and acting are far better than [...] your routine slasher/shocker knock-off.\" He further noted that \"[t]here are plenty of shocks and surprises\" and described the film as \"psychological horror rather than gorefest,\" although he expressed ambiguity over the film's abrupt ending: \"One of the biggest shocks in ''Vacancy'' is that, after 84 minutes, it ends.
