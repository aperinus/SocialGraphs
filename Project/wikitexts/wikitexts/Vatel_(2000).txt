In the context of the [[Franco-Dutch War]], a financially struggling [[Louis, Grand Cond\u00e9]] is visited by King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] for three days of festivities at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chantilly]]. The prince wants a commission as a general, and spares no expense in order to impress the king. In charge of organizing the event is [[Fran\u00e7ois Vatel]], Master of Festivities and Pleasures in the prince's household. Vatel is a man of great honor and talent, but of low birth. As the great Cond\u00e9 is prepared to do anything in his quest for stature, the tasks assigned to Vatel are often menial and dishonourable. While Vatel tries to maintain his dignity amidst the extravaganza he is meant to orchestrate, he finds himself in love with Anne de Montausier, the king's latest lover, who returns his affections. However, due to their incompatible social standing and the rigid hierarchy of the court, continuing the liaison is clearly impossible.\n\nIn the last day of the king's visit, Vatel realizes that he is nothing more than a puppet in the hands of his superiors, bought and sold like a piece of property, after learning that the Prince of Cond\u00e9 has \"lost\" him in a card game with the king. Disheartened and refusing to leave his people (the servants of the Ch\u00e2teau) and go to work for the king, Vatel commits suicide by throwing himself on his sword. Nevertheless, the king is told by his own court members that Vatel killed himself because the roast was not sufficient to feed several unexpected guests, the clouds dulled the fireworks display and he lacked confidence that there would be enough fish for the morning meal. This explanation pleases the king very much. Anne de Montausier is grief-stricken upon hearing the news, but knows she must not speak of it. She leaves the court quietly, and no one ever hears about her and Vatel again.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as [[Fran\u00e7ois Vatel]]\n* [[Uma Thurman]] as Anne de Montausier\n* [[Tim Roth]] as [[Antonin Nompar de Caumont, duc de Lauzun|Marquis of Lauzun]]\n* [[Timothy Spall]] as [[Jean Herauld Gourville|Gourville]]\n* [[Julian Glover]] as [[Louis, Grand Cond\u00e9|Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9, \"Grand Cond\u00e9\"]]\n* [[Julian Sands]] as [[Louis XIV]]\n* [[Murray Lachlan Young]] as [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe of France, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, \"Monsieur\"]], only brother of King Louis XIV.\n* [[Hywel Bennett]] as [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]]\n* [[Richard Griffiths]] as [[Pierre Bourdelot|Dr. Bourdelot]]\n* [[Arielle Dombasle]] as [[Claire-Cl\u00e9mence de Maill\u00e9-Br\u00e9z\u00e9|Claire Cl\u00e9mence de Maill\u00e9, \"Princess of Cond\u00e9\"]] \n* [[Marine Delterme]] as [[Madame de Montespan]], mistress of King Louis XIV. \n* [[Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu]] as [[Anne Genevi\u00e8ve de Bourbon|Anne Genevi\u00e8ve de Bourbon, \"Duchess of Longueville\"]]\n* [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Pradon]] as Marquis of Effiat, lover of the Monsieur.\n* [[F\u00e9odor Atkine]] as Alcalet\n* {{ill|Nathalie Cerda|fr|}} as [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Austria]], wife of King Louis XIV. \n* Emilie Ohana as [[Louise de la Valli\u00e8re]], another mistress of the king. \n* S\u00e9bastien Davis as Demaury\n* Louis Bustin as Martin\n* [[Vincent Grass]] as Martin's Father\n}}\n\n== Reception ==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 31% of 32 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4.6/10.
