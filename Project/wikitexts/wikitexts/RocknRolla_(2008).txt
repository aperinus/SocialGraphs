It was released in the [[United Kingdom]] on 5 September 2008, hitting number one in the UK box office in its first week of release.<ref name=\"ukfilmcouncil\"/> Over the years, the film has gained a [[Cult film|cult]] following.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-12-28|title=''RocknRolla 2'' Updates: Is It Happening?|url=https://screenrant.com/rocknrolla-2-movie-updates-release-date-story/|access-date=2020-08-08|website=ScreenRant|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn London, mob boss Lenny Cole rules the ever-growing [[real estate]] business, using a corrupt [[councillor]] for bureaucratic fixing, and his right-hand man Archy for the dirty side of things. A billionaire Russian businessman, Uri Omovich, plans a fixed land deal, and London's crooks seem to all want a piece of it \u2014 particularly Uri's underhanded [[accountant]] Stella, and a gang called \"The Wild Bunch\" led by small-time crook \"One-Two\", his partner \"Mumbles\", and their driver \"Handsome Bob\".\n\nUri agrees to Lenny's price of \u20ac7,000,000 for [[Bribery|bribing]] the Council, and as a sign of trust, loans him his \"lucky painting\". Yet when Uri arranges for Stella to move the funds, she double-crosses him and hires the Wild Bunch to steal the money. Additionally, Lenny's estranged and drug-addicted stepson Johnny Quid steals the painting from Lenny's office after faking his own death. Lenny and Archy then coerce Johnny's former [[talent manager]]s Mickey and Roman into tracking down Johnny. In a subplot, Handsome Bob gets close to Stella's gay husband, a lawyer who has information on a longtime unknown [[informant]] in their criminal circle.\n\nUri tasks Stella once more with covertly siphoning the necessary payoff from his holdings, despite his growing suspicion of her. Yet when his moneymen are once again robbed by the Wild Bunch, his assistant Victor convinces him that it's likely Lenny who is behind the robberies, and is also purposely keeping Uri's lucky painting from him. Uri and Victor then invite Lenny to a private golf game, where Victor beats him with a golf club, finishing by breaking Lenny's leg as a warning to return his painting.\n\nWild Bunch friend Cookie happens to buy the painting from a couple of [[crackhead]]s who stole it from Johnny's hideout. Cookie then gives the painting to One-Two who, in turn, offers the painting to Stella as a token of appreciation after a sexual encounter. After Stella leaves his flat, One-Two is surprised by Uri's [[henchman|henchmen]] but is rescued, and subsequently kidnapped, by Archy and his goons who had come looking for Uri's money.\n\nUri wants to marry Stella, whom he has long admired. He goes to Stella's house to propose, but he then spots the painting. Stella lies and says she has had it for years. Uri, enraged by Stella's betrayal, orders Victor to kill her.\n\nArchy brings Johnny, Roman, Mickey and the Wild Bunch to Lenny's [[warehouse]] where Lenny orders Johnny and the Wild Bunch executed. Handsome Bob offers the legal documents concerning the informant in his pocket to Archy. Archy recognizes the [[pseudonym]] used on documents, \"Sidney Shaw\", as belonging to Lenny. Lenny had arranged with the police to routinely lock up many criminal associates (including Archy) for years at a time to ensure his own freedom and while also enhancing his own standing in the criminal underworld. Archy orders Lenny's men to free the Wild Bunch and has Lenny drowned and fed to [[crayfish]].\n\nIn the elevator, Johnny explains to Roman and Mickey that they will also be killed to leave no witnesses, and graphically explains the manner of their executions. His description unnerves the man tasked to execute the trio, prompting him to act prematurely. Having already anticipated this move, Johnny warns Mickey and Roman to intervene and kill their would-be executioner. Johnny shoots two more men waiting at the top of the elevator and with help from the Wild Bunch, they escape the last of Archy's men.\n\nLater, Archy picks up Johnny from [[drug rehabilitation|rehab]] and gives him Uri's lucky painting as a welcome home present, remarking that obtaining the painting \"cost a very wealthy Russian an arm and a leg\". Johnny proclaims that, with his new-found freedom from addiction and his stepfather, he will do what he could not before: \"become a real RocknRolla\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:RockNRolla08TIFF.jpg|thumb|Members of the cast of the film at a screening at the [[2008 Toronto International Film Festival]]]]\n*[[Gerard Butler]] as One-Two, a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[mobster]] who is the leader of the Wild Bunch.\n*[[Tom Wilkinson]] as Lenny Cole, the head of London's declining old school mob regime.\n*[[Thandiwe Newton]] (credited as Thandie Newton) as Stella, Uri's accountant and One-Two's love interest.\n*[[Mark Strong]] as Archy, Lenny Cole's right-hand man and the film's narrator.\n*[[Idris Elba]] as Mumbles, One-Two's partner and a member of the Wild Bunch.\n*[[Tom Hardy]] as Handsome Bob, a member of the Wild Bunch who is a [[closeted]] gay man who has a semi-secret crush on One-Two.\n*[[Karel Roden]] as Uri Omovich, a Russian [[business oligarch]].\n*[[Toby Kebbell]] as Johnny Quid, a musician and Lenny's estranged and drug-addicted stepson who faked his own death after anticipating that the news of his demise would cause his music sales to go up.
