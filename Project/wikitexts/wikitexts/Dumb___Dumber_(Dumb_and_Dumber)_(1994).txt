It is the first installment in the [[Dumb and Dumber (franchise)|''Dumb and Dumber'' franchise]]. Starring [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Jeff Daniels]], it tells the story of Lloyd Christmas (Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Daniels), two dumb but well-meaning friends from [[Providence, Rhode Island]], who set out on a cross-country trip to [[Aspen, Colorado]], to return a briefcase full of money to its owner, thinking it was abandoned as a mistake though it was actually left as a  [[ransom]]. [[Lauren Holly]], [[Karen Duffy]], [[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]], [[Charles Rocket]], and [[Teri Garr]] play supporting roles.\n\nThe film was released on December 16, 1994.

Lloyd, a chip-toothed limousine driver, immediately falls in love when he meets Mary Swanson, a woman he is driving to the airport. Upon arriving and saying goodbye to Lloyd, she leaves a briefcase in the terminal. Lloyd sees this and attempts to return it to her, unaware that it contains ransom money for her kidnapped husband, Bobby, and that she intentionally left it for her husband's captors, Joe \"Mental\" Mentalino and J. P. Shay. Her [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]]-bound plane has already departed, leading to Lloyd running through and falling out of the [[jetway]].\n\nFired from his job for leaving the scene of an accident, Lloyd returns to his apartment and learns that Harry has also been fired from his dog-grooming job after delivering dogs late to a show and accidentally getting them dirty. Mental and Shay follow Lloyd home from the airport in pursuit of the briefcase. Mistaking the crooks for debt collectors, the two flee the apartment and return later to find that Mental and Shay have ransacked the apartment and decapitated Harry's [[parakeet]]. Lloyd suggests they head to Aspen to find Mary and return the briefcase, hoping she can \"plug them into the social pipeline\". At first, Harry opposes the idea, but he eventually agrees and the pair leaves the next day.\n\nMental and Shay catch up to the duo at a motel that night. Posing as a hitchhiker, Mental is picked up by Harry and Lloyd while Shay secretly follows them. During a lunch stop, the duo pranks Mental with [[chili pepper]]s in his burger, unaware that he has a [[stomach ulcer]]. When Mental reacts adversely, they accidentally kill him with rat poison pills (which he planned to use on them) after mistaking it for his medication. Meanwhile, the police are waiting on the road to Colorado for them to show up, after finding out about Mental's death. Nearing Colorado, Lloyd takes a wrong turn after getting distracted and ends up driving all night through [[Nebraska]]. Upon waking up and realizing Lloyd's mishap, Harry gives up on the journey and decides to walk home, but Lloyd later persuades him to continue after trading the van for a [[minibike]].\n\nThe two arrive in Aspen, but are unable to locate Mary. After a short scuffle over some gloves that night, the briefcase breaks open and they discover the money; they spend it on a hotel suite, clothes, and a car. They learn that Mary and her family are hosting a gala and prepare to attend. At the gala, Harry, attempting to lure Mary over to Lloyd, reluctantly agrees to go skiing with her the next day and lies to Lloyd that he got him a date. The next day, Lloyd finds out Harry lied to him after waiting all day for Mary at the hotel bar.\n\nIn retaliation, Lloyd pranks Harry by serving him a [[coffee]] laced with a potent dose of [[laxative]], causing Harry to spontaneously [[Diarrhea|defecate]] in a broken toilet at Mary's house. Lloyd arrives at Mary's house and informs her that he has her briefcase. He takes her to the hotel, shows her the briefcase, and confesses his love after some initial struggle; she rejects him, as she is already married. Nicholas Andre, an old friend of the Swansons and the mastermind behind Bobby's kidnapping, arrives with Shay and, upon learning that Harry and Lloyd had spent all of the ransom money and replaced the money with [[IOU]]s, takes Lloyd and Mary hostage, as well as Harry when he returns. An argument leads Nicholas to shoot Harry. Before Nicholas can kill them, an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] team led by Beth Jordan (whom Harry met earlier at a gas station and Lloyd met earlier at the bar) raids the suite, where Beth tells Harry and Lloyd that the FBI and the police had been following them all the way from Providence. Harry is revealed to be alive thanks to a bulletproof vest that was strapped on him earlier. Nicolas and Shay are arrested, and Mary and Bobby are reunited, much to Lloyd's dejection.\n\nThe next day, Harry and Lloyd are seen walking home on foot because all of their purchases were confiscated and their minibike has broken down. The two unintentionally decline the chance to be oil boys for a group of bikini girls, after which Harry tells Lloyd that they will get their \"break\" one day, then play a friendly game of [[Tag (game)|tag]] as they walk back to Rhode Island.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as Lloyd Christmas: A goofy chip-toothed slacker who has been fired from several jobs.
