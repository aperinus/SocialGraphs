It is directed by [[Barry Levinson]], written by [[James Toback]], and stars [[Warren Beatty]] as Siegel and [[Annette Bening]] as Hill. The supporting cast includes [[Harvey Keitel]], [[Ben Kingsley]], [[Elliott Gould]], [[Bebe Neuwirth]], and [[Joe Mantegna]].\n\n''Bugsy'' was given a limited released by [[TriStar Pictures]] on December 13, 1991, followed by a theatrical wide release on December 20, 1991. It received generally positive reviews from critics and was a minor box office hit, grossing $49.1 million on a $30 million budget. It received ten nominations at the [[64th Academy Awards]] (including for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]) and won two: [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]. It won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1941, gangster [[Bugsy Siegel|Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel]], who had partnered in crime since childhood  with [[Meyer Lansky]] and [[Charlie Luciano]], goes to [[Los Angeles]] and instantly falls in love with [[Virginia Hill]], a tough-talking [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] starlet. The two meet for the first time when Bugsy visits actor [[George Raft]] on the set of ''[[Manpower (1941 film)|Manpower]]''. He buys a house in [[Beverly Hills]], planning to stay there while his wife and two daughters remain in [[Scarsdale, New York]].\n\nBugsy is in California to wrestle control of betting parlors away from weak [[Los Angeles crime family]] boss [[Jack Dragna]]. Ascending local Jewish gangster [[Mickey Cohen]] robs Dragna's operation one day. He is confronted by Bugsy, who decides he should be in business with the guy who committed the robbery, not the guy who got robbed. Cohen is put in charge of the betting casinos; Dragna is forced to confess  to a raging Bugsy that he stole $14,000 and is told he now answers to Cohen.\n\nAfter arguments{{clarification needed|reason=generally everyone holds court?|date=October 2022}} about Virginia's trysts with drummer [[Gene Krupa]] and various bullfighters and Bugsy's reluctance to get a divorce, Virginia makes a romantic move on Bugsy. On a trip to [[Nevada]] to make a maintenance call to a rough gambling joint, Bugsy is struck with the inspiration for a luxury hotel and casino in the desert of Nevada, which happens to be in the only state where gambling is legal. He obtains $1 million in funding from Lansky and other [[New York City]] mobsters, on the motion of going big doing it legit in Nevada. Virginia wants no part of it until Bugsy offers her a share, puts her in charge of accounting and begins constructing the [[Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel Casino]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]; however, the budget soon soars out of control to $6 million due to his extravagance. Bugsy tries everything to ensure it gets completed, even selling his share of the casino.\n\nBugsy is visited in Los Angeles by former associate [[Harry Greenberg]], who has betrayed his old associates to save himself{{clarification needed|reason=This doesn't sound like it involves baptism, but it must involve his soul, because as recounted by the rest of this sentence, his personal circumstances are an ongoing tire fire.|date=October 2022}} and run out of money from a combination of his gambling habits and being extorted by prosecutors who want his testimony. Though he is Harry's trusted friend, Bugsy has no choice but to kill him. He is arrested for the murder, but the only witness is a cab driver who dropped Harry off in front of Bugsy's  house. The driver is paid to leave town.\n\nLansky waits for Bugsy outside the jail and gives a satchel of money to his friend, though warns that he will no longer be able to protect Bugsy. The Flamingo's opening night is a total failure in a rainstorm, and $2 million of the budget is unaccounted for. Bugsy discovers that Virginia stole the money, which he then lets her keep. He then urges Lansky never to sell his share of the casino because he will live to thank him someday.\n\nLater that night, Bugsy is shot and killed in his home. Virginia is told the news in Las Vegas and knows her own days could be numbered.\n\nThe end title cards state that one week after Bugsy's death, Virginia returned all of the missing money to Lansky, and later committed suicide in Austria. By 1991, the $6 million invested in Bugsy's Las Vegas dream had generated $100 billion revenues{{clarification needed|reason=We're to believe that half the budget of Nevada points back to this tiny seed fund? And what are revenues in a casino anyway? Is it like measuring the productivity of an oil field by counting the number of barrels of water circulated through the pump as you siphon off 1\u201310% of the black cream on top, before pushing the \"filtered\" water back where it came from? Because casinos have a weirdly similar circular flow of dollar into slot machine, most of a dollar right back out.|date=October 2022}}.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Warren Beatty]] as [[Bugsy Siegel|Ben \"Bugsy\" Siegel]]\n* [[Annette Bening]] as [[Virginia Hill]]\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as [[Mickey Cohen]]\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Meyer Lansky]]\n* [[Elliott Gould]] as [[Harry Greenberg]]\n* [[Joe Mantegna]] as [[George Raft]]\n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as Countess Dorothy di Frasso\n* [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] as [[Charlie Luciano]]\n* [[Lewis Van Bergen]] as [[Joe Adonis]]\n* [[Wendy Phillips]] as Esta Siegel, Bugsy's first wife\n* [[Richard C.

After completing ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'', Beatty had several projects that he wanted to do but his two dream projects were to produce, star, and possibly direct the life story of [[Howard Hughes]] and the life story of Bugsy. Beatty stated that of all the characters he played in films, such as [[Clyde Barrow]] in ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' and [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]] in ''Reds'', he felt that he was the right actor to play both Bugsy and Hughes.\n\nBeatty was fascinated by Siegel, who he thought was a strange emblem of America (an American gangster who was the son of Jewish immigrants who became fascinated with [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] and who also envisioned a [[Las Vegas|desert city in which legal gambling is allowed]]). Several filmmakers attempted to make a film based on Bugsy's life, most famously French director [[Jean-Luc Godard]], who wrote a script entitled ''The Story'' and envisioned [[Robert De Niro]] as Siegel and [[Diane Keaton]] as Virginia Hill.\nIn the late 1970s, Beatty met screenwriter [[James Toback]], with whom he became fast friends when Beatty was preparing ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]''. Years later, when Beatty was in pre-production on ''[[Ishtar (film)|Ishtar]]'', he asked Toback to write a script on Bugsy.\n\nDuring the course of six years and in between two films that he was involved in, Toback wrote a 400-page document of Bugsy's life. However, under some strange circumstances,{{clarify|date=June 2015}} Toback lost the entire document. Under pressure from [[Warner Bros.]], who Beatty learned also had a Bugsy Siegel script ready to be produced, Beatty pursued Toback to write a script based on his lost document. Toback handed his new script to Beatty. Beatty approved it and went to several studios in hopes of obtaining financing and distribution for the film. Beatty presented Toback's script to Warner Bros. and claimed that it was much better than the one that Warner Bros. was interested in producing. Warner Bros. passed on the project, and Beatty eventually got the backing of [[TriStar Pictures]].\n\nInitially, Toback was under the impression that ''he'' would be the director. For a while, Beatty could not find a director (he did not know or chose not to know of Toback's desire to direct the film). Beatty feared that he would be stuck in the position of having to direct the film himself. He said, \"I'm in just about every scene of the picture, and I didn't want to have to do all that other work.\" However, Beatty announced to Toback that [[Barry Levinson]] was on board to direct ''Bugsy''. At first, Toback was disappointed, but he quickly learned that Levinson was the right person for the job. Despite the length of the script (which would have run three and a half to four hours), Beatty, Levinson, and Toback condensed it to a two-and-a-half to three-hour script. The trio worked very closely together during the production of the film.\n\nDuring casting, Beatty wanted [[Annette Bening]] to play the role of Virginia Hill. Before ''Bugsy'', Bening was a candidate to play Tess Trueheart in Beatty's ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]''. After seeing her audition, Beatty phoned Levinson and told him, \"She's terrific. I love her. I'm going to marry her\". Levinson thought Beatty was just excited at her audition and did not think that Beatty actually meant what he had said. Both Beatty and Bening stated that their relationship started after completing the film. Later that summer, Bening became pregnant with her and Beatty's first child, which resulted in a tabloid/media frenzy at the time. The child was born January 8, 1992, and the couple married on March 12.\n\nOriginally, Beatty played Bugsy with a heavy New York City accent (which can be heard in the trailer). However, both Levinson and Toback thought that the accent was not right, so Beatty dropped the accent (which he thought was \"charming\") and used his normal voice.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in January 1991, and filming wrapped in May 1991. Portions of the film were shot in the [[Coachella Valley]], California.<ref name=Filming>{{cite web |title=Coachella Valley Feature Film Production 1920\u20132011 |url=http://www.visitpalmsprings.com/page/filming-in-palm-springs/126939|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305201810/http://www.visitpalmsprings.com/page/filming-in-palm-springs/126939|archive-date=5 March 2016|work=Filming in Palm Springs |access-date=October 1, 2012 |author=Palm Springs Visitors Center |location=Palm Springs, CA}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=December 2016}}<ref>http://visitpalmsprings.com/stream/126941?mode=Download {{dead link|date=December 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n''Bugsy'' had a limited release on December 13, 1991, and was released nationwide on December 20, 1991.
