[[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) prisoner [[Bobby Sands]] (played by [[John Lynch (actor)|John Lynch]]) led a protest against the treatment of IRA prisoners, claiming that they should be treated as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] rather than criminals. The mothers of two of the strikers, played by [[Helen Mirren]] and [[Fionnula Flanagan]], fight to save their sons' lives.
