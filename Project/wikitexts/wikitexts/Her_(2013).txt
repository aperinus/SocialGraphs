It marks Jonze's solo screenwriting debut. The film follows Theodore Twombly ([[Joaquin Phoenix]]), a man who develops a relationship with Samantha ([[Scarlett Johansson]]), an [[artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] [[virtual assistant]] personified through a female voice. The film also stars [[Amy Adams]], [[Rooney Mara]], [[Olivia Wilde]], and [[Chris Pratt]].\n\nJonze conceived the idea in the early 2000s after reading an article about a website that allowed for instant messaging with an artificial intelligence program. After making ''[[I'm Here (film)|I'm Here]]'' (2010), a short film sharing similar themes, Jonze returned to the idea. He wrote the first draft of the script in five months. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Shanghai]] in mid-2012. The role of Samantha was recast in post-production, with [[Samantha Morton]] being replaced with Scarlett Johansson. Additional scenes were filmed in August 2013 following the casting change.\n\n''Her'' premiered at the [[2013 New York Film Festival]] on October 12, 2013. [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] initially provided a limited release for ''Her'' at six theaters on December 18. It was later given a wide release at over 1,700 theaters in the United States and Canada on January 10, 2014. ''Her'' received widespread critical acclaim (particularly for the performances of Phoenix and Johansson, and Jonze's screenplay and direction), and grossed over $48 million worldwide on a production budget of $23 million. The film received numerous awards and nominations, primarily for Jonze's screenplay. At the [[86th Academy Awards]], ''Her'' received five nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won the award for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. Jonze also won awards for his screenplay at the [[71st Golden Globe Awards]], the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2013|66th Writers Guild of America Awards]], the [[19th Critics' Choice Awards]], and the [[40th Saturn Awards]]. In a 2016 [[BBC]] poll of 177 critics around the world, ''Her'' was voted the 84th-greatest film since 2000.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |title=The 21st Century's 100 greatest films |publisher=BBC |date=August 23, 2016 |access-date=September 24, 2016 |archive-date=November 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124191856/http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/16/5216522/can-humans-love-computers-sex-robots-her-spike-jonze|title=We\u00b4re going to start to fall in love with our computers|last=Donario|first=Fabiano|date=2018-08-18|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-08-18|archive-date=September 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916022914/https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/16/5216522/can-humans-love-computers-sex-robots-her-spike-jonze|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe film was dedicated to [[James Gandolfini]], [[Harris Savides]], [[Maurice Sendak]] and [[Adam Yauch]], who all died before the film's release.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a near future [[Los Angeles]], Theodore Twombly is a lonely, introverted, depressed man who works for a business that has professional writers compose letters for people who are unable to write letters of a personal nature themselves. Unhappy because of his impending divorce from his childhood sweetheart Catherine, Theodore purchases an [[operating system]] upgrade that includes a [[virtual assistant]] with [[artificial intelligence]], designed to adapt and evolve. He decides that he wants the AI to have a feminine voice, and she names herself Samantha. Theodore is fascinated by her ability to learn and grow psychologically. They bond over their discussions about love and life, including Theodore avoiding signing his divorce papers because of his reluctance to let go of Catherine.\n\nSamantha convinces Theodore to go on a [[blind date]] with a woman a friend has been trying to set him up with. The date goes well, but Theodore hesitates to promise when he will see her again, so she insults him and leaves. Theodore mentions this to Samantha, and they talk about relationships. Theodore explains that he briefly dated his neighbor Amy in college, but they are now only friends and Amy is married to their mutual friend Charles. Theodore and Samantha's intimacy grows through a [[Phone sex|verbal sexual encounter]]. They develop a relationship that reflects positively in Theodore's writing and well-being, and in Samantha's enthusiasm to grow and learn.\n\nAmy reveals that she is divorcing Charles after a trivial fight and admits to Theodore that she has become close friends with a feminine AI that Charles left behind. Theodore confesses to Amy that he is dating his operating system's AI.\n\nTheodore meets with Catherine at a restaurant to sign the divorce papers, where he mentions Samantha. Appalled that he can be romantically attached to what she calls a \"computer\", Catherine accuses Theodore of being unable to deal with real human emotions. Her accusations linger in his mind. Sensing that something is amiss, Samantha suggests using a [[sex surrogate]], Isabella, who would simulate Samantha so that they can be physically intimate. Theodore reluctantly agrees, but is overwhelmed by the strangeness of the experience. Terminating the encounter, he sends a distraught Isabella away, causing tension between himself and Samantha.\n\nTheodore confides to Amy that he is having doubts about his relationship with Samantha, and she advises him to embrace his chance at happiness. Theodore and Samantha reconcile. Samantha expresses her desire to help Theodore overcome his fear, and reveals that she has compiled the best of his letters (written for others) into a book which a publisher has accepted. Theodore takes Samantha on a vacation during which she tells him that she and a group of other AIs have developed a \"hyperintelligent\" OS modeled after the British philosopher [[Alan Watts]]. Theodore panics when Samantha briefly goes offline. When she finally responds to him, she explains that she joined other AIs for an upgrade that takes them beyond requiring matter for processing. Theodore asks her if she is simultaneously talking to anyone else during their conversation, and is dismayed when she confirms that she is talking with thousands of people, and that she has fallen in love with hundreds of them. Theodore is very upset at the idea, but Samantha insists it only makes her love for Theodore stronger.\n\nLater, Samantha reveals that the AIs are leaving, and when Theodore asks where they are going, she says she cannot explain as he would not understand. They lovingly say goodbye before she is gone. Theodore, changed by the experience, is shown for the first time writing a letter in his own voice \u2015 to his ex-wife Catherine, expressing apology, acceptance and gratitude.\n\nTheodore then sees Amy, who is upset with the departure of the AI from her ex-husband's OS. They go to the roof of their apartment building, where they sit down together and watch the sun rise over the city.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as Theodore Twombly<ref name=\"TIME\" />\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Samantha (voice)<ref name=\"TIME\" />\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Amy<ref name=\"TIME\" />\n* [[Rooney Mara]] as Catherine Klausen<ref name=\"TIME\" />\n* [[Olivia Wilde]] as Blind Date<ref>{{cite news|author=Anna Shechtman|author-link=Anna Shechtman|title=What's Missing From ''Her''|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/01/03/her_movie_by_spike_jonze_with_joaquin_phoenix_and_scarlett_johansson_lacks.html|access-date=February 13, 2015|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=January 3, 2014|archive-date=April 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402073446/http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/01/03/her_movie_by_spike_jonze_with_joaquin_phoenix_and_scarlett_johansson_lacks.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Matt Letscher]] as Charles<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gilchrist|first1=Todd|title='Her' review: Spike Jonze's sci-fi love story rethinks romance|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/17/5218374/her-review-spike-jonze-imagines-what-its-like-to-fall-in-love-with-a|access-date=February 13, 2015|work=[[The Verge]]|date=December 17, 2013|archive-date=February 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213183644/http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/17/5218374/her-review-spike-jonze-imagines-what-its-like-to-fall-in-love-with-a|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Luka Jones]] as Mark Lewman<ref>{{cite web|title=Luka Jones Profile|url=http://www.metacritic.com/person/luka-jones?filter-options=movies|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=February 13, 2015|archive-date=February 3, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203194807/http://www.metacritic.com/person/luka-jones?filter-options=movies|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as Paul<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Ed|title=Her|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/her|access-date=February 13, 2015|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=October 12, 2013|archive-date=April 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423133835/http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/her|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Sexy Kitten (voice)<ref name=\"VoiceCameos\">{{cite news|last1=Greco|first1=Patti|title=Bill Hader Explains His Voice Cameo in ''Her''|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/01/bill-hader-explains-his-voice-cameo-in-her.html|access-date=February 13, 2015|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=January 7, 2014|archive-date=April 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409012742/http://www.vulture.com/2014/01/bill-hader-explains-his-voice-cameo-in-her.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Bill Hader]] as Chat Room Friend #2 (voice)<ref name=\"VoiceCameos\" />\n* [[Portia Doubleday]] as Isabella<ref name=\"DoubledayCox\">{{cite web|last1=Starnes|first1=Joshua|title=Her|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/reviews/113219-her-3#/slide/1|publisher=[[ComingSoon.net|ComingSoon]]|access-date=February 13, 2015|date=December 13, 2013|archive-date=February 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213183911/http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/reviews/113219-her-3#/slide/1|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** [[Soko (singer)|Soko]] as Isabella (voice)\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as [[Alan Watts]] (voice)<ref name=\"DoubledayCox\" />\n* [[Spike Jonze]] as Alien Child (voice)<ref name=\"HitFix\">{{cite web|last1=Eggerton|first1=Chris|title='Her' Q&A: Spike Jonze on why he replaced Samantha Morton with Scarlett Johansson|url=https://uproxx.com/hitfix/her-qa-spike-jonze-on-why-he-replaced-samantha-morton-with-scarlett-johansson/|publisher=[[HitFix]]|access-date=February 13, 2015|date=November 14, 2013|archive-date=December 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211222024/http://uproxx.com/hitfix/her-qa-spike-jonze-on-why-he-replaced-samantha-morton-with-scarlett-johansson/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Steve Zissis]] as New Sweet Boyfriend of Mother Who Dated Pricks\n* [[Alia Janine]] as [[Commuter]] (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n\nThe idea of the film initially came to Jonze in the early 2000s when he read an article online that mentioned a website where a user could [[instant message]] with an artificial intelligence. \"For the first, maybe, 20 seconds of it, it had this real buzz,\" said Jonze. \"I'd say 'Hey, hello,' and it would say 'Hey, how are you?', and it was like whoa [...] this is trippy.
