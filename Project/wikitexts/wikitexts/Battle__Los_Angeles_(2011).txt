The storyline was conceived from a [[screenplay]] written by [[Christopher Bertolini|Chris Bertolini]], based in part on a [[World War II]] incident dubbed the \"[[Battle of Los Angeles]]\".<ref name=\"GLAR\"/> The film is set in modern-day [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and follows a Marine Staff Sergeant played by [[Aaron Eckhart]] who leads a [[Platoon#United States organization|platoon]] of [[U.S. Marines]], joined by other stranded military personnel, during a global [[alien invasion]].<ref name=\"film\">[[Jonathan Liebesman]] (Director). (2011). ''Battle: Los Angeles'' [Motion picture] Production Notes. United States: [[Columbia Pictures]].</ref> The ensemble cast includes [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (actor)|Ramon Rodriguez]], [[Bridget Moynahan]], [[Ne-Yo]], and [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]].\n\nThe film was a co-production of [[Columbia Pictures]], [[Relativity Media]], and [[Original Film]]. It was distributed by Columbia, while [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] released the film in the video rental market. The film won the [[BMI Awards|BMI TV Music Award]] for composer [[Brian Tyler]]. The film score was orchestrated by Tyler in conjunction with the [[Hollywood Studio Symphony]]. The soundtrack was released by the [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] music label on March 8, 2011.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in September 2009, and the film was released in the United States on March 11, 2011. It grossed $211 million worldwide against a production budget of around $70 million, and received generally negative reviews from critics. It was released on [[DVD-Video|DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] on June 14, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nOn August 12, 2011, a number of apparent [[meteor]]s landed in the world's oceans, near 20 major coastal cities. The objects prove to be spacecraft containing hostile [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]]. As Los Angeles (LA) is being evacuated, Marines from [[Camp Pendleton]] arrive, including Staff Sergeant Michael Nantz, an [[Iraq War]] veteran. Nantz, who was to begin his retirement, is assigned to the 1st Platoon, Echo Company, of the [[2nd Battalion, 5th Marines]].\n\nUnder the command of 2nd Lieutenant William Martinez, the platoon arrives at a [[forward operating base]] (FOB) established at [[Santa Monica Airport]]. The alien ground forces have no apparent air support, so the Air Force prepares to carpet bomb the Santa Monica area, and the platoon is given three hours to retrieve civilians from an [[LAPD]] station in West LA. As they advance through LA, they are ambushed and suffer multiple casualties. Nantz takes Marines Imlay and Harris to look for Lenihan, who is missing from the group. After fighting off an alien, they team up with some soldiers from the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Infantry Division]] and an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] [[Intelligence assessment|intelligence]] Technical Sergeant, Elena Santos. At the police station, the makeshift platoon finds five civilians: veterinarian Michele, children Kirsten, Amy and Hector, and Hector's father Joe. A helicopter arrives to evacuate wounded Marines, but cannot take on the weight of the civilians. During takeoff, it is destroyed by alien air units, killing Grayston, Guerrero, Lenihan, and Simmons.\n\nThe Marines commandeer an abandoned transit bus for the evacuation. En route, they deduce that the alien air units are [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]] that target human [[Radio#Communication systems|radio transmissions]]. Santos reveals that her mission is to locate the aliens' [[Command and control#Command and control centers|command and control center]], as its destruction should deactivate the drones. When their bus comes under attack on an elevated freeway, the Marines [[rappel]] the group to street level. In the ensuing battle, Marines Stavrou and Mottola and the remainder of the Army National Guard soldiers are killed, while both Joe and Lieutenant Martinez are wounded fighting the aliens. Martinez uses his radio to attract the aliens, then detonates explosives, sacrificing himself. Nantz is now in command of surviving personnel Santos, Imlay, Kerns, Lockett, Harris, Adukwu and the civilians, continuing their escape from the bombing zone. A news report interviews a scientist who speculates that the aliens are seeking Earth's water <!-- the scientist states that \"H2O is only a liquid on this planet\" - water = liquid and liquid = water, even in this context the two are the same thing -->for fuel while eradicating the human population.\n\nThe carpet bombing never happens. Reaching the FOB, the Marines find it destroyed and that the military is retreating from LA. The Marines plan to escort the civilians to an alternate extraction point. When Joe dies from his wounds, Nantz comforts Hector. Lockett confronts Nantz regarding his brother, a Marine who, with four others, was killed during Nantz's last tour. They come to peace when Nantz explains that he continues to think of them, and recites each one's name, rank and serial number. Nantz motivates the group to move forward to honor their fallen comrades, including Joe for his bravery. They reach the extraction point and evacuate by helicopter.\n\nIn flight, the chopper experiences a brief loss of power. Nantz theorizes that they are flying near the alien command center, transmitting intense radio messages to its drones. He orders his unit to accompany the civilians while he stays to reconnoiter the area, but his fighters all join him. Searching through sewers, they confirm the presence of a large alien vessel. Kerns radios in to request missiles, which Nantz manually directs using a [[laser designator]] while the others defend his position. Kerns is killed when a drone homes in on his radio, but the Marines succeed in routing a missile to the command module, which is destroyed. The uncontrolled drones fall from the sky, and the alien ground forces retreat.\n\nThe remaining fighters\u2014Nantz, Imlay, Lockett, Harris, Adukwu and Santos\u2014are evacuated to a base in the [[Mojave Desert]], where they are greeted as heroes. They are told that their successful method has been transmitted to the armies battling alien forces in 19 other cities, that Michele and the three children were rescued, and that they can now rest. Instead, they re-arm and join the armed force leaving to retake Los Angeles.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:AaronEckhart10TIFF.jpg|thumb|195px|right|Aaron Eckhart, who portrayed United States Marine Corps Staff Sergeant Michael Nantz]]\n* [[Aaron Eckhart]] as [[United States Marine Corps]] [[Staff sergeant#U.S. Marine Corps|Staff Sergeant]] Michael Nantz\n* [[Michelle Rodriguez]] as [[United States Air Force]] [[Technical sergeant#United States Air Force and United States Space Force|Technical Sergeant]] Elena Santos, [[Air Force Specialty Code|1st Force]], [[61st Air Base Wing|61 Air Base Wing]]\n* [[Ne-Yo]] as United States Marine Corps [[Corporal#United States Marine Corps|Corporal]] Kevin J. \"Specks\" Harris\n* [[Bridget Moynahan]] as Michele\n* [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as Joe Rincon\n* [[Cory Hardrict]] as United States Marine Corps Corporal Jason \"Cochise\" Lockett\n* [[Jim Parrack]] as United States Marine Corps [[Lance corporal#Marine Corps|Lance Corporal]] Peter J. \"Irish\" Kerns\n* [[Gino Anthony Pesi]] as United States Marine Corps Corporal Nick C. \"Stavs\" Stavrou\n* [[Lucas Till]] as United States Marine Corps Corporal Scott Grayston\n* [[Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (actor)|Ramon Rodriguez]] as United States Marine Corps [[Second Lieutenant (United States)|2nd Lieutenant]] William Martinez, 1st Platoon\n* [[Noel Fisher (actor)|Noel Fisher]] as United States Marine Corps [[Private first class#United States Marine Corps|Private First Class]] Shaun \"Casper\" Lenihan\n* [[Adetokumboh M'Cormack]] as [[United States Navy]] [[Hospital Corpsman]] [[Petty officer second class|Second Class]] Jibril A. \"Doc\" Adukwu\n* [[Will Rothhaar]] as United States Marine Corps Corporal Lee \"Cowboy\" Imlay\n* [[Neil Brown Jr.]] as United States Marine Corps Corporal Richard \"Motown\" Guerrero\n* [[Taylor Handley]] as United States Marine Corps Lance Corporal Corey Simmons\n* [[James Hiroyuki Liao]] as United States Marine Corps Lance Corporal Steven \"Motorolla\" Mottola\n* [[Joey King]] as Kristen\n* Bryce Cass as Hector Rincon\n* Jadin Gould as Amy\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[Jonathan Liebesman]] intended the film to be a realistic depiction of an alien invasion in the style of a [[war film]], taking inspiration from the films ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'', ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', and ''[[United 93 (film)|United 93]]'' for his documentary style of filming.<ref name=\"interview2\">{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/battle-los-angeles-interview-jonathan-liebesman-ori-marmur-jeffrey-churnov/72974/ |title=Director Jonathan Liebesman, Producer's Ori Marmur & Jeffrey Churnov, James D.

The incident occurred a day after the [[Bombardment of Ellwood]] when an [[Imperial Japanese]] submarine launched shells at US aviation fuel tanks; West-coast tensions were already running high in the months after the December 1941 [[Pearl Harbor Attack]] and entry of the US into [[World War II]]. Eyewitnesses and [[radar]] data reported an unknown aerial craft over the Los Angeles area on February 24, leading to fears of a Japanese attack on the US mainland. But a review of the incident found no proof of Japanese presence in the area and attributed the incident to an overreaction by US military forces. In later years, UFO investigators speculated the aircraft spotted on the night was an extraterrestrial craft.<ref>[http://www.noufors.com/Documents/BattleOfLosAngeles.pdf The History of the 4th AA Command, Western Defense Command, Jan 9 1942 to July 1 1945 (extract)], edited by Dale Goudie, Jim Klotz and Chris Lambright.
