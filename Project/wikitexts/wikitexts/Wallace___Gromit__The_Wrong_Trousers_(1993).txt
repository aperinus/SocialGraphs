It is the second film featuring the eccentric inventor Wallace (voiced by [[Peter Sallis]]) and his dog Gromit, following ''[[A Grand Day Out]]'' (1989)''.'' In the film, a villainous penguin named Feathers McGraw uses Wallace and Gromit's robot \"Techno-Trousers\" to steal a diamond from the city museum.\nThis was the last Wallace and Gromit film to have Wallace as the only spoken character.\n\n''The Wrong Trousers'' premiered in the United States on 17 December 1993, and the United Kingdom on 26 December 1993 on [[BBC Two]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/499585?view=transmission|title=The Wrong Trousers (1993)|work=BFI|access-date=4 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019143938/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/499585?view=transmission|archive-date=19 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was commercially successful, and won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] in 1994. It also inspired a charity fundraising day, known as \"Wrong Trousers Day\", one of several events.\n\nThe short was followed by two sequels, ''[[A Close Shave]]'', released in December 1995, and ''[[A Matter of Loaf and Death]]'' released in December 2008. Feathers McGraw returns in the 2003 video game ''[[Wallace & Gromit in Project Zoo]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nOn Gromit\u2019s birthday, Wallace gives him a new invention called the \u201cTechno-Trousers\u201d to take him for walks, and discovers he does not have enough money to pay off his bills and debts. Wallace lets the spare bedroom to a penguin, who befriends Wallace and drives Gromit from the house. The penguin takes an interest in the techno-trousers, which can walk on walls and ceilings, and secretly rewires them for radio control. Meanwhile, Gromit realizes that the penguin is Feathers McGraw, a wanted robber who frequently disguises himself as a chicken.\n\nFeathers forces Wallace into the techno-trousers and later sends him on a test run through town. Gromit spies on Feathers as he takes measurements of the city museum, and discovers Feathers' plans to steal a diamond from the museum. While Wallace is asleep in his bed, Feathers marches him to the museum and uses the trousers to infiltrate the building. He uses a remotely operated crane claw, contained in a helmet he has made Wallace wear, to capture the diamond, but accidentally trips the alarm. As Wallace wakes up, Feathers returns to the house and traps him and Gromit in a wardrobe at pistol-point.\n\nGromit rewires the trousers to break open the wardrobe. He and Wallace chase Feathers aboard their model train set to stop him from escaping. Wallace disarms Feathers and frees himself from the trousers. After Feathers' train collides with the trousers, Gromit captures him in a milk bottle. The police imprison Feathers in the wall of the city zoo. Wallace and Gromit pay their debts with the reward money, while the techno-trousers walk off into the sunset.\n\n==Soundtrack alterations==\nIn the original airing, first VHS release of the film and the 1999 DVD release, Gromit's [[birthday card]] plays \"[[Happy Birthday to You]]\".\n\nIn subsequent home video releases and airings, this was replaced with \"[[For He's a Jolly Good Fellow]]\" to avoid copyright infringements (likely due to this version of Happy Birthday being copyrighted). Also altered (again for reasons of copyright) are two specific songs from the penguin's radio, which were replaced with unidentified pieces of music, played through a [[Hammond organ]]. \"[[Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree]]\", also played through the same instrument, was left intact, due to being in the public domain.\n\nThe pieces that were removed are \"[[Happy Talk (song)|Happy Talk]]\" from the musical ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' and \"[[(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?]]\", along with Wallace's singing of the latter during the subsequent morning. In addition, Gromit's television during breakfast no longer plays the [[Open University]] theme, although an announcer can still be heard saying, \"Welcome to Open University\".\n\nHowever, the original soundtrack can still be heard in the background of the commentary track of the DVD release, although the Blu-ray release features the commentary track with the altered soundtrack. The original soundtrack can also be heard in non-English versions of the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wallace and gromit Nespravne kalhoty|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciZIkE_rrag|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201043810/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciZIkE_rrag|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 February 2014|via=YouTube|access-date=23 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''The Wrong Trousers'' was voted as the eighteenth best British television show by the British Film Institute.<ref>{{cite web|title=The BFI TV 100: 1-100|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/list/list.php|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911083558/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/list/list.php|archive-date=11 September 2011|access-date=19 December 2010}}</ref> The film has an approval rating of [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|100%]] on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 26 reviews, and an average score of 9.10/10.
