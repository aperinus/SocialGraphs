Kondracki and [[Eilis Kirwan]] wrote the screenplay, which was inspired by the story of [[Kathryn Bolkovac]], a [[Nebraska]] police officer who was recruited as a United Nations peacekeeper for [[DynCorp International]] in post-war [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1999. While there, she discovered a Bosnian [[sex trafficking]] ring serving and facilitated by DynCorp employees, with international peacekeepers looking the other way. Bolkovac was fired and forced out of the country after attempting to shut down the ring. She took the story to [[BBC News]] in the UK and won a [[wrongful dismissal]] lawsuit against DynCorp.\n\nKondracki wanted her debut film to concern human trafficking, and she encountered Bolkovac's story in college. She and Kirwan struggled to obtain financial support for the project. Eight years after Kondracki decided to produce the film, she secured funding and cast Weisz in the lead role. ''The Whistleblower''{{mdash}}a co-production of Canada, Germany, and the United States{{mdash}}was filmed in [[Romania]] from October to December 2009.\n\n''The Whistleblower'' [[Film premiere|premiered]] on 13 September 2010 at the [[2010 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival]], and [[Samuel Goldwyn Films]] distributed the film in theaters in the United States. The film was advertised as a fictionalization of events occurring during the late 1990s. Kondracki said that the facts are broadly accurate but some details were omitted for the film; for example, a three-week \"breaking-in\" period for trafficking victims was not shown. The film received mixed reviews. The performances by Weisz and her co-stars were praised, but the intense violence depicted in several scenes was debated by critics, with some calling it exploitative. Kondracki and Weisz responded that what happened in Bosnia had been toned down for the film. ''The Whistleblower'' received several awards and nominations, including three nominations at the 2012 [[Genie Awards]]. UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] hosted a screening of the film and promised action would be taken to prevent further instances of human trafficking. ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that other UN officials attempted to downplay the events depicted and that initiatives against trafficking in Bosnia were aborted.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Kathryn Bolkovac]] is a police officer from [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], who accepts an offer to work with the [[United Nations Police|United Nations International Police]] in post-war [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] for a private contractor called Democra Security (a thinly-veiled allusion to [[DynCorp International]]).<ref name=\"Lynch\"/> After successfully advocating for a Muslim woman who experienced domestic abuse, Kathryn is appointed head of the department of gender affairs.\n\nRaya, a young [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] woman, and her friend Luba are sold to a Bosnian sex-trafficking ring by a relative. Raya escapes with Irka, another girl forced into prostitution, and they are sent to a women's shelter for victims of [[human trafficking]]. While investigating their case, Kathryn uncovers a large-scale [[sexual slavery]] ring utilized by international personnel (including Americans).\n\nKathryn persuades Raya and Irka to testify against their traffickers in court, guaranteeing their safety; however, an indifferent UN official drops Irka at the border between Bosnia and Serbia when she cannot produce a passport. Although rescued from the woods by Kathryn, Irka is too afraid to proceed with the trial. Meanwhile, Raya is recaptured by the traffickers after a corrupt peacekeeper tips them off. To deter other girls from running away and talking to the authorities, the traffickers make an example out of Raya by brutally raping her with a metal pipe in front of them.\n\nWhen she brings the scandal to the attention of the UN, Kathryn discovers that it has been covered up to protect lucrative [[Defense contractor|defense]] and security contracts. However, she finds allies in her investigation: [[Madeleine Rees]], head of the Human Rights Commission, and internal-affairs specialist Peter Ward. As her investigation continues, Kathryn is met with threats on her answering machine and dead ends when highers-up override and close all the Internal Affairs cases. Still, she continues to try to find Raya, and finally locates her on a raid, but Raya refuses to come with her. A few days later, Raya is found dead, having been shot in the head by one of the traffickers, Ivan.\n\nKathryn sends an email to fifty senior mission personnel detailing her findings; she is then fired from her job. One night, Kathryn enters DynCorp to gather evidence of the sex trafficking but is cornered by Ward and another employee. She is forced to hand the evidence to Ward but it turns out to be a distraction planned by both him and Kathryn. They succeed in escaping before Kathryn is deported from the country where she brings her evidence to [[BBC News]] in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe final credits note that after Kathryn's departure, a number of peacekeepers were sent home (although none faced criminal charges because of immunity laws), and the U.S. continues doing business with private contractors like Democra Security (including billion-dollar contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan).\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, plus next 6 and all roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Rachel Weisz]] as [[Kathryn Bolkovac]]\n* [[David Strathairn]] as Peter Ward\n* [[Nikolaj Lie Kaas]] as Jan van der Velde\n* Anna Anissimova as Zoe\n* [[Roxana Condurache]] as Raya\n* [[Monica Bellucci]] as Laura Leviani\n* [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as [[Madeleine Rees]]\n* [[Paula Schramm]] as Luba\n* [[Alexandru Potocean]] as Viko\n* [[William Hope (actor)|William Hope]] as Blakely \n* Rayisa Kondracki as Irka\n* [[Jeanette Hain]] as Halyna\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as Nick Kaufman\n* [[David Hewlett]] as Fred Murray\n* [[Coca Bloos]] as Milena\n* [[Luke Treadaway]] as Jim Higgins\n* [[Liam Cunningham]] as Bill Hynes\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\n{{quote box\n|width = 30em\n|border = 1px\n|align=right\n|bgcolor=#c6dbf7\n|fontsize = 85%\n|title_bg =\n|title_fnt =\n|title =\n|quote = There were so many people in the same situation as her.

Kondracki subsequently devoted significant time to research human trafficking and the sex trade. After Bolkovac sold her the film rights for $100,<ref name=Griffin/> she resolved to adapt the story for the screen.<ref name=\"Karpel\"/> Financing for the project was initially difficult to secure, although the situation improved after [[Rachel Weisz]] was cast as Bolkovac. \"I was young and na\u00efve,\" Kondracki said of her initial attempts to secure funding. \"I thought: 'Of course they're going to make my film. It's brilliant!'\"<ref name=\"Karpel\"/>\n\n''The Whistleblower'' was described as a \"fictionalized dramatic presentation\" of a late-1990s scandal. The producers based it on Bolkovac's experiences, rather than on her memoir.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/> [[Vanessa Redgrave]] played [[Madeleine Rees]], a UN human-rights official (\"one of the film's few heroic characters\") who helps Bolkovac uncover the sex trade. Raya ([[Roxana Condurache]]) and Luba (Paula Schramm), two Ukrainian young women who are trafficked into Bosnia, are the primary representations of the trafficking victims encountered by Bolkovac. Neither is based on a particular person; they are composites of young women forced to work in Bosnian brothels. Kondracki's younger sister, Rayisa, also played a trafficking victim.<ref name=\"Holden\"/> For legal reasons the pseudonym \"Democra Security\" was used for [[DynCorp International]], the organization whose employees reportedly sexually enslaved the women.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nAlthough the producers kept the film factual, they debated how much to include. Details on the bureaucracy were removed. Kondracki said, \"It was too much information and, frankly, people were bored.\"<ref name=\"Karpel\"/> Another concern was how much violence against the sex-trafficking victims should be depicted in the film. Kondracki chose to bluntly portray the inhumane treatment of the young women, which she described as accurate representations of what happened.<ref name=\"Lynch\">{{cite news|last=Lynch|first=Colum|title=The Whistleblower: The movie the U.N. would prefer you didn't see|work=[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]|url=http://turtlebay.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/06/29/the_whistleblower_the_movie_the_un_would_prefer_you_didnt_see|date=29 June 2011|access-date=3 October 2013}}</ref> This included a graphic scene in which Raya is raped with a lead pipe after her escape and recapture.
