Robinson]] in his final film role. It is loosely based on the 1966 science fiction novel ''[[Make Room! Make Room!]]'' by [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]], with a plot that combines elements of [[science fiction]] and a [[police procedural]]. The story follows a murder investigation in a dystopian future of dying oceans and year-round [[humidity]] caused by the [[greenhouse effect]], with the resulting [[pollution]], [[resource depletion|depleted resources]], [[poverty]], and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].<ref name=\"Shirley 2007\">{{cite web |last=Shirley|first=John |author-link=John Shirley |title=Soylent Green: An Appreciation 34 Years Too Late |website=Locus Online |date=September 23, 2007 |url=http://www.locusmag.com/2007/Shirley_SoylentGreen.html |access-date=November 17, 2016}}</ref> In 1973, it won the [[Nebula Award]] for Best Dramatic Presentation and the [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film]].\n\n==Plot==\nBy 2022,<ref name=\"Kooser 2022\">{{cite web | last=Kooser | first=Amanda | title=Soylent Green predicted 2022 as a dystopian hellscape.

[[New York City]] has a population of 40 million, and only the elite can afford spacious apartments, clean water, and natural food. The homes of the elite are fortified, with security systems and bodyguards for their tenants. Usually, they include [[concubinage|concubines]] (who are referred to as \"furniture\"). The poor live in squalor, haul water from communal spigots, and eat highly processed wafers: Soylent Red, Soylent Yellow, and the latest product, far more flavorful and nutritious, Soylent Green.\n\n[[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] detective Robert Thorn lives with his aged friend Sol Roth, a brilliant former college professor and police analyst (referred to as a \"Book\"). Thorn is investigating the murder of the wealthy and influential William R. Simonson, a board member of the Soylent Corporation, which he suspects was an assassination. With the help of Simonson's concubine Shirl, his investigation leads to a priest that Simonson had visited shortly before his death. Because of the sanctity of the confessional, the visibly exhausted priest can only hint to Thorn at the contents of the confession. Soon after, the priest is murdered in the confessional by Fielding, Simonson's former bodyguard. Under orders from Governor Santini, Thorn's superiors order him to end the investigation but he continues, fearing that he will lose his job if he files a false report. He soon becomes aware that an unknown stalker is following him. As Thorn tries to control a violent throng during a Soylent Green shortage riot, he is attacked by the assassin who killed Simonson. The killer shoots twice at Thorn but misses, his shots striking bystanders in the crowd. Before Thorn can catch him, the killer is crushed by the hydraulic shovel of a police riot control vehicle.\n\nIn researching the case for Thorn, Roth brings two volumes of \"Soylent Oceanographic Survey Report, 2015\u20132019\", taken by Thorn from Simonson's apartment, to the team of other \"Books\" at the Supreme Exchange{{what|date=November 2022}}. The \"Books\" conclude from the oceanographic reports that the oceans are dying and can no longer produce the plankton from which Soylent Green is made. This information confirms to Sol Roth that Simonson's murder was ordered by his fellow Soylent Corporation board members who knew Simonson was increasingly troubled by the truth and feared he might disclose it to the public.\n\nRoth is so shaken by the truth that he decides to \"return to the home of God\" and seeks [[assisted suicide]] at a government clinic. Thorn rushes to stop him but arrives too late. Before dying, Roth tells his discovery to Thorn. Thorn moves to uncover proof of crimes against humanity and to bring it to the attention of The Supreme Exchange in order that the case be brought to the Council of Nations to take action.\n\nThorn secretly boards a waste truck transporting human bodies from the euthanasia center to a waste disposal plant where he witnesses human corpses being processed and turned into Soylent Green. Thorn is discovered but he escapes. As he returns to the Supreme Exchange, he is ambushed by Soylent operative Fielding and his men. Finding refuge in the church where Simonson confessed, Thorn kills his attackers but is seriously wounded in a gun battle. As paramedics tend to Thorn, he urges Lt. Hatcher to spread the truth while shouting to the surrounding crowd, \"Soylent Green is people!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as Robert Thorn\n* [[Leigh Taylor-Young]] as Shirl\n* [[Chuck Connors]] as Fielding\n* [[Brock Peters]] as Hatcher\n* [[Paula Kelly (actress)|Paula Kelly]] as Martha\n* [[Edward G.

In his book ''The Actor's Life: Journal 1956\u20131976'', Heston wrote, \"He knew while we were shooting, though we did not, that he was terminally ill. He never missed an hour of work, nor was late to a call. He never was less than the consummate professional he had been all his life.
