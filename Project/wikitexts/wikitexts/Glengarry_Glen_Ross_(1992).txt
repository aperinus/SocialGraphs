The film depicts two days in the lives of four [[real estate]] salesmen, and their increasing desperation when the corporate office sends a motivational [[Facilitator|trainer]] to threaten them that all but the top two salesmen will be fired within two weeks.\n\nThe setting is never explicitly stated.

The [[Film premiere|world premiere]] was held at the [[49th Venice Film Festival]], where [[Jack Lemmon]] was awarded the [[Volpi Cup]] for Best Actor. [[Al Pacino]] was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Academy Award]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. Yet, the film was a [[Box-office bomb|box office failure]] for grossing $10.7 million in [[North America]] against a $12.5 million budget. It has since become a cult classic.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film depicts two days in the lives of four [[real estate]] salesmen who are supplied with [[Lead generation|leads]] \u2014 the names and phone numbers of prospects \u2014 and use deceitful and dubious sales tactics. Many of the leads rationed out by office manager John Williamson lack either the money or the desire to actually invest in land. The firm sends Blake, one of its top salesmen, to motivate the team. In a torrent of verbal abuse, he gives them all notice of termination and tells them that the top deal-closers of the month (with one week to go) will keep their jobs and gain access to promising leads for the Glengarry Highlands development.\n\nShelley \"The Machine\" Levene is a once-successful salesman in a long-running slump and with a daughter in the hospital. Desperate to keep his job, Levene tries to persuade Williamson to give him some of the Glengarry leads, but Williamson refuses. Levene tries first to charm Williamson, then to threaten him, and finally to bribe him. Williamson is willing to sell some of the prime leads, but demands cash in advance, which Levene does not have.\n\nMeanwhile, Dave Moss and George Aaronow complain about the firm's management, and Moss proposes that they strike back by stealing all the Glengarry leads and selling them to a competing agency. Moss's plan requires Aaronow to break into the office, stage a burglary and steal all of the prime leads. Aaronow wants no part of the plan, but Moss tries to coerce him, saying that Aaronow is already an [[accessory before the fact]] simply because he knows about the proposed burglary.\n\nWhile all of these events are happening, [[Richard Roma]], the office's top closer, tries to manipulate a meek, middle-aged man named James Lingk into buying a property. Framing the deal as an opportunity rather than a purchase, Roma plays on Lingk's feelings of insecurity.\n\nThe next day, when the salesmen come into the office, they learn that there has been a burglary and the Glengarry leads have been stolen. Williamson assures Roma that his contract with Lingk was not stolen, and he and the police question each of the salesmen in private. After his interrogation, an infuriated Moss has one last shouting match with Roma and leaves in disgust. Lingk arrives to demand his [[down payment]] back under the [[Cooling-off period (consumer rights)|three-day cooling-off period]] because his wife objected to the deal. Roma tries several tactics to stall and confuse Lingk but is interrupted by the police detective, who wants to question him. He lies to Lingk, telling him that the check has not yet been cashed and there is time to change his wife's mind. Williamson, who is unaware of the tactic, contradicts him, causing Lingk to rush out of the office upset. Roma vulgarly berates Williamson for interfering, then submits to questioning.\n\nLevene, proud of a massive sale he made that morning, takes the opportunity to mock Williamson in private. In his zeal to humiliate Williamson, he mentions that Williamson lied about cashing the check. Williamson realizes that Levene must have broken into the office and seen the check on his desk, and threatens to inform the police if he does not return the leads. Cornered, Levene admits that he sold the leads to a competitor and split the money with Moss. Levene attempts to bribe Williamson with a share of his sales to keep quiet, but Williamson scoffs that Levene has no sales. His latest buyers are a notorious deadbeat couple who have no money and merely enjoy talking to salesmen. Levene, crushed by this revelation, asks Williamson why he seeks to ruin him. Williamson coldly responds, \"Because I don't like you.\" Levene pleads for his ill daughter, but Williamson rebuffs him and leaves to inform the detective.\n\nRoma emerges from questioning. Unaware of the exchange, he compliments Levene on his sale and suggests that they form their own partnership. As Levene gets up to meet with the detective, he looks back wistfully at Roma, who has already returned to his sales work.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Richard Roma]]\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as Sheldon \"Shelley the Machine\" Levene\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Blake\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as George Aaronow\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Dave Moss\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as John Williamson\n* [[Jonathan Pryce]] as James Lingk\n* [[Bruce Altman]] as Larry Spannel\n* [[Jude Ciccolella]] as Detective Baylen\n* Paul Butler as Policeman \n* [[Lori Tan Chinn]] as Coat Check Girl\n\n==Production== \nDavid Mamet's play was first performed in 1983 at the <!-- Not 'Royal' until 1988. -->[[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in London. It won the  [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]] in 1984. That year, the play made its [[United States|American]] debut in [[Chicago]] before moving to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Producer Jerry Tokofsky read the play on a trip to [[New York City]] in 1985 at the suggestion of director [[Irvin Kershner]] who wanted to make it into a film.<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\">{{cite news | last = Weinraub | first = Bernard | title = The ''Glengarry'' Math: Add Money and Stars, then Subtract Ego | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = October 12, 1992 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/12/movies/the-talk-of-hollywood-the-glengarry-math-add-money-and-stars-then-subtract-ego.html | access-date = 2010-03-31 }}</ref> Tokofsky saw the play on Broadway and contacted Mamet. Stanley R. Zupnik was a [[Washington, D.C.]] based producer of [[B movie]]s who was looking for a more profitable project. Tokofsky had co-produced two previous Zupnik films. In 1986, Tokofsky told Zupnik about Mamet's play, and Zupnik saw it on Broadway but found the plot confusing.\n\nMamet wanted $500,000 for the film rights and another $500,000 to write the screenplay. Zupnik agreed to pay Mamet's $1 million asking price, figuring that they could cut a deal with a cable company to bankroll the production. Because of the uncompromising subject matter and abrasive language, no major studio wanted to finance it, even with film stars attached. Financing came from cable and video companies, a German television station, an Australian cinema chain, several banks, and [[New Line Cinema]] across four years.<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\"/>\n\n[[Al Pacino]] originally wanted to do the play on Broadway, but at the time he was doing another Mamet production, ''[[American Buffalo (play)|American Buffalo]]'', in [[London]]. He expressed interest in appearing in the film adaptation. In 1989, Tokofsky proposed a role to [[Jack Lemmon]].<ref name= \"Blanchard, Jayne\">{{cite news | last = Blanchard | first = Jayne M | title = ''Glengarry'' Hits the Screen with the Joys of Male Angst | work = [[Washington Times]] | date = September 27, 1992 }}</ref> During this time, Kershner dropped out to make another film ''[[RoboCop 2]]'', as did Pacino with ''[[Sea of Love (film)|Sea of Love]]''. [[Alec Baldwin]], also attached, was earmarked to play the Roma role vacated by Pacino. He reportedly left the project over a contract disagreement, the real reason being Pacino was still being considered for Roma, and would be cast over Baldwin if he elected to accept the role. [[James Foley (director)|James Foley]]'s agent sent Foley Mamet's screenplay in early 1991, but Foley was hesitant to direct because he \"wanted great actors, people with movie charisma, to give it watchability, especially since the locations were so restricted\".<ref name= \"Hartl, John\">{{cite news | last = Hartl | first = John | title = Director is Happy to put Big Stars in Film Version of Mamet Play | work = [[Seattle Times]] | date = September 28, 1992 }}</ref> Foley took the screenplay to Pacino, with whom he had been trying to work on a film for years.<ref name= \"production notes\">{{cite news | title = ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' Production Notes | work = [[New Line Cinema]] Press Kit | year = 1992 }}</ref> Foley was hired to direct, only to leave the production as well.\n\nBy March 1991, Tokofsky contacted Baldwin and begged him to reconsider doing the film. Baldwin's character was specifically written for the actor and the film, and is not in the play. Tokofsky remembers, \"Alec said: 'I've read 25 scripts and nothing is as good as this. OK. If you make it, I'll do it'.\"<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\"/> The two arranged an informal reading with Lemmon in [[Los Angeles]]. Subsequently, the three organized readings with several other actors. Lemmon remembered, \"Some of the best damn actors you're ever going to see came in and read and I'm talking about ''names''\".<ref name= \"production notes\"/> Tokofsky's lawyer, Jake Bloom, called a meeting at the [[Creative Artists Agency]], who represented many of the actors involved, and asked for their help. CAA showed little interest, but two of their clients \u2013 [[Ed Harris]] and [[Kevin Spacey]] \u2013 soon joined the cast.\n\nBecause of the film's modest budget, many of the actors took significant pay cuts. For example, Pacino cut his per-movie price from $6 million to $1.5 million, Lemmon was paid $1 million, and Baldwin received $250,000.<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\"/> Other actors, like [[Robert De Niro]], [[Bruce Willis]],<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\"/> [[Richard Gere]], and [[Joe Mantegna]],<ref name= \"Blanchard, Jayne\"/> expressed interest in the film. Mantegna had been in the original Broadway cast and won a [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play|Tony Award]] in 1985 for his portrayal of Roma.\n\nOnce the cast was assembled, they spent three weeks in rehearsals. With a budget set at $12.5 million, filming began in August 1991 at the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in [[Queens, New York]], and on location in [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn]], over 39 days. Harris remembered: \"There were five and six-page scenes we would shoot all at once. It was more like doing a play at times [when] you'd get the continuity going\".<ref name= \"production notes\"/> Alan Arkin said of the script, \"What made it [challenging] was the language and the rhythms, which are enormously difficult to absorb\".<ref name= \"production notes\"/> During filming, cast members would arrive outside of their required days, just to watch the other actors' performances.<ref name= \"Berardinelli, James\">{{cite news | last = Berardinelli | first = James | title = ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' | work = ReelViews | year = 2006 | url = http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/g/glengarry_glen.html | access-date = 2007-09-23 }}</ref>\n\nThe director of photography, [[Juan Ruiz Anch\u00eda]], relied on low lighting and shadows. A color scheme of blues, greens, and reds was used for the first part of the film, and the second half has a monochromatic blue-grey color scheme.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}\n\nDuring production, Tokofsky and Zupnik had a falling out over money and credit for the film.
