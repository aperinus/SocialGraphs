It is the [[sequel]] to the 1984 film ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' and the second installment in the [[Beverly Hills Cop (franchise)|''Beverly Hills Cop'' film series]]. Murphy returns as Detroit police detective [[Axel Foley]], who reunites with Beverly Hills detectives Billy Rosewood ([[Judge Reinhold]]) and John Taggart ([[John Ashton (actor)|John Ashton]]) to stop a robbery/gun-running gang after Captain Andrew Bogomil ([[Ronny Cox]]) is shot and seriously wounded.\n\nDespite it making less money than the first film and receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film was still a box office success, grossing $276.5 million. Aside from box office success, the film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] and for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, for [[Bob Seger]]'s \"[[Shakedown (Bob Seger song)|Shakedown]]\".\n\n==Plot==\nBeverly Hills Police Captain Andrew Bogomil, Detective Billy Rosewood, and Sergeant John Taggart are trying to figure out who is behind the \"Alphabet Crimes\", a series of mostly high-end-store robberies distinguished by their monogrammed envelopes with an alphabetical sequence the assailants leave behind. Complicating matters is the new \"political\" state of the [[Beverly Hills Police Department]], headed by incompetent, egotistical and verbally abusive new police chief Harold Lutz, who is doing everything he can to stay on Mayor Ted Egan's good side. Furious when Rosewood calls the FBI to help solve the case, Lutz holds Bogomil responsible as commanding officer and suspends him, despite Bogomil's efforts to convince the chief that Rosewood was only following a hunch. Lutz also punishes Taggart and Rosewood by placing them on traffic duty. On the way home, Bogomil is shot at and injured by Karla Fry, the chief enforcer of Maxwell Dent, who is secretly the mastermind behind the Alphabet Crimes. After hearing about the shooting on a news report, [[Axel Foley]] secretly abandons his current undercover duties and immediately flies out to Beverly Hills to help find out who shot Bogomil, finding Taggart and Rosewood all too happy to assist him.\n\nPosing as an undercover FBI agent to get past Lutz with the aid of Detective Jeffrey Friedman, Axel soon makes the connection between the robberies and Dent. He first finds out that [[AutoMag (pistol)|the ammunition]] fired at one of the robberies was made by a gunsmith for Charles Cain, the manager of a gun club owned by Dent. Axel has Bogomil's daughter Jan use her connections as an insurance agent to find out about Dent's financial dealings. Dent is robbing his own businesses on purpose in order to finance firearms transactions with an arms dealer named Nikos Thomopolis and is discreetly using Cain as the front man for his operations. Bogomil was shot because his investigation was on the correct track into the case.\n\nHaving foiled a robbery attempt at a bank depot, Axel tricks Dent's accountant Sidney Bernstein into letting him use his computer, discovering that Dent and Karla are planning to leave the country. Axel also learns from Jan that all of Dent's businesses have had their insurance coverage canceled and are about to go bankrupt except his racetrack. Hurrying to the racetrack, Axel solves the latest riddle sent to the police, and is convinced that this riddle was made easily solvable in order to implicate Cain as the Alphabet Bandit and throw the authorities off Dent's trail.\n \nThe trio arrive but are unable to prevent the robbery and find Cain, shot by Karla, among those killed. While Lutz announces publicly that the Alphabet Crimes have been solved, Axel notices some red mud at the stables, which leads him, Taggart and Rosewood to Dent's oil field, where Dent is making his final arms deal with Thomopolis. The three get into a shootout with everyone involved in the deal. Rosewood destroys one shipment with a rocket-propelled grenade as the truck is leaving the scene, while Axel destroys another truck shipment with grenades.  Dent confronts Axel in the warehouse, but Axel gets distracted by one of Dent's henchmen on the roof above him and Dent gets away. Dent then crashes through the wall in his car and Axel shoots Dent through the windshield. The car hits Axel and goes down a hill, erupting in flames. Karla appears and is about to kill Axel, but Taggart makes it in time to save Axel and Karla is shot dead by Taggart.\n\nJust as the last criminals are about to flee, the police arrive on time and made it to the scene and arrest the remainder of Dent's goons and Thomopolis. Lutz and Mayor Egan come as well. Lutz is furious at Rosewood and Taggart for their insubordination and attempts to arrest Axel. However, both Taggart and Rosewood, frustrated, stand up to an infuriated Lutz and prove that Dent was the real Alphabet Bandit and the rest of the alphabet crimes were about the arms deal. They are also able to convince Mayor Egan of Lutz's incompetence, and the mayor fires Lutz for his abusive attitude towards his own men and for jeopardizing the investigation.\n\nMayor Egan chooses Bogomil to replace Lutz as the new Police Chief. Axel returns to Detroit, but only after he is told off by Inspector Todd over the phone, after Egan called Todd to congratulate him on allowing Axel to assist them on this case.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as Detective [[Axel Foley]]\n* [[Judge Reinhold]] as Detective Billy Rosewood\n* [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]] as Maxwell Dent\n* [[John Ashton (actor)|John Ashton]] as Sergeant John Taggart\n* [[Ronny Cox]] as Captain Andrew Bogomil\n* [[Brigitte Nielsen]] as Karla Fry\n* [[Allen Garfield]] as Chief Harold Lutz\n* [[Brian O'Connor (actor)|Brian O'Connor]] as Detective Biddle\n* [[Dean Stockwell]] as Charles Cain\n* [[Gil Hill]] as Inspector Douglas Todd\n* [[Gilbert Gottfried]] as Sidney Bernstein\n* [[Paul Reiser]] as Detective Jeffrey Friedman\n* [[Paul Guilfoyle]] as Nikos Thomopolis\n* [[Robert Ridgely]] as Mayor Ted Egan\n* Alice Adair as Jan Bogomil\n* [[Glenn Withrow]] as Willie\n* [[Tom Bower (actor)|Tom Bower]] as Russ Fielding\n* [[Hugh Hefner]] as Himself\n* [[Frank Pesce]] as Carlotta \n* [[Chris Rock]] as Parking Valet\n* [[Valerie Wildman]] as Gun Club Receptionist \n* [[Robert Pastorelli]] as Vinnie\n* [[Tommy 'Tiny' Lister]] as Orvis\n* [[John Hostetter]] as Stiles\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Paramount Pictures]] had planned a [[television series]] based on the [[Beverly Hills Cop|first film]].

However, the film's soundtrack album, released by [[MCA Records]], includes only a different version sung by [[Corey Hart (singer)|Corey Hart]], with different lyrics. The film introduced [[George Michael]]'s controversial song \"[[I Want Your Sex]]\", a number 2 hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

It was the second time the sisters had contributed to the [[Beverly Hills Cop (franchise)|''Beverly Hills Cop'' franchise]]; they'd notched a top 10 single with \"[[Neutron Dance]]\" from the [[Beverly Hills Cop (soundtrack)|''Beverly Hills Cop'' soundtrack]]. [[Harold Faltermeyer]]'s 1988 album, ''Harold F'', includes a song called \"Bad Guys\", which is used as part of the film's score\u2014an instrumental section of the song plays during the opening jewelry store robbery scene, and also during several other scenes throughout the film.\n\nThe soundtrack debuted at {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 8 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums charts and spent 26 weeks on the charts, a far cry compared to the 49 weeks spent by the first film's soundtrack. Despite this, one song from the album, \"Shakedown\", was nominated for an Academy Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.
