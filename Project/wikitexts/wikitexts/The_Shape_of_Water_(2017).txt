It stars [[Sally Hawkins]], [[Michael Shannon]], [[Richard Jenkins]], [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]], [[Michael Stuhlbarg]], and [[Octavia Spencer]]. Set in 1962 [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], the film follows a [[Muteness|mute]] cleaner at a high-security government laboratory who falls in love with a captured [[humanoid]] [[amphibian]] creature, and decides to help him escape from death at the hands of an evil colonel. Filming took place on location in [[Ontario]], Canada, from August to November 2016.\n\n''The Shape of Water'' was screened as part of the main competition in the [[74th Venice International Film Festival]], where it premiered on August 31, 2017, and was awarded the [[Golden Lion]]. It was also screened at the [[2017 Toronto International Film Festival]]. It began a [[limited release]] in two theaters in New York City on December 1, 2017, before expanding wide on December 23, 2017, and grossed $195&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\n''The Shape of Water'' was acclaimed by critics, who lauded its acting, screenplay, direction, visuals, production design, cinematography, and musical score, but was criticized for the lack of labels to the theme. The [[American Film Institute]] selected it as one of the [[American Film Institute Awards 2017|top ten films of 2017]]. The film was nominated for thirteen awards at the [[90th Academy Awards]], winning four, and received [[List of accolades received by The Shape of Water|numerous other accolades]]. It was the second fantasy film to win [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], after ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (2003). A novelization by del Toro and [[Daniel Kraus (author)|Daniel Kraus]] was published on March 6, 2018.\n\n== Plot ==\nElisa Esposito, who was found abandoned as an infant with wounds on her neck by the side of a river, is [[Muteness|mute]] and communicates through [[sign language]]. By 1962, during the [[Cold War]], Esposito works as a cleaner at a secret government laboratory in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and lives a very routine life. Her only friends are her [[closeted]] next-door neighbor Giles, a struggling middle-aged advertising illustrator, and her co-worker Zelda Fuller. [[Colonel]] Richard Strickland has just captured a mysterious creature from a South American river and has taken the creature to the Baltimore facility for further study. Curious about the creature, Elisa discovers it is a [[humanoid]] [[amphibian]]. She begins visiting him in secret, and the two form a close bond.\n\nSeeking to exploit the Amphibian Man for a US advantage in the [[Space Race]], [[General of the Air Force|General]] Frank Hoyt is eventually persuaded by Strickland to [[Vivisection|vivisect]] it. Dr. Robert Hoffstetler \u2013 a scientist who is secretly a Russian spy named Dimitri Mosenkov \u2013 pleads unsuccessfully to keep the Amphibian Man alive for further study and is simultaneously ordered by his Soviet [[Agent handling|handlers]] to [[Euthanasia|euthanize]] the creature. When Elisa overhears the Americans' plans for the Amphibian Man, she persuades Giles to help her liberate him. Hoffstetler stumbles upon Elisa's plot in progress and chooses to assist her. Though initially reluctant, Zelda also becomes involved in making the escape successful.\n\nElisa plans to release the Amphibian Man into a nearby canal when heavy rain will allow access to the ocean. In the meantime, she keeps him in her bathtub. Strickland interrogates Elisa and Zelda, among others, but he learns nothing. Back at the apartment, Giles discovers the Amphibian Man devouring one of his cats. Startled, the Amphibian Man slashes Giles's arm and rushes out of the apartment. He gets as far as the cinema downstairs before Elisa finds him and returns him to her apartment. The creature touches Giles on his balding head and wounded arm; the next morning, Giles discovers his hair has begun growing back, and the wounds on his arm have [[Regeneration (biology)|healed]]. Elisa continues to develop her romantic relationship with the Amphibian Man, culminating in [[sexual intercourse]].\n\nGeneral Hoyt unexpectedly arrives and tells Strickland he has 36 hours to recover the Amphibian Man, or his career and life will be over. Meanwhile, Hoffstetler is told he will be [[Extraction (military)|extracted]] from the US in two days. Although the planned release date approaches, the Amphibian Man's health begins to deteriorate. Hoffstetler goes to meet his handlers, and Strickland follows him. At the rendezvous, Hoffstetler is shot by one of his handlers, but Strickland in turn shoots and kills both handlers. Having realized that he is a spy, Strickland tortures the dying Hoffstetler into revealing specifics on the \"team\" which broke out Amphibian Man, and Strickland is surprised to learn that Elisa and Zelda are implicated. Strickland threatens Zelda at home, unsuccessfully, until her husband, Brewster, reveals that Elisa has the Amphibian Man. Zelda immediately telephones Elisa, warning her to release the creature. An enraged Strickland ransacks Elisa's empty apartment until he finds a calendar note revealing where she plans to release the Amphibian Man.\n\nAt the canal, Elisa and Giles are bidding farewell to the creature when Strickland arrives, knocks Giles down, and shoots both the Amphibian Man and Elisa. The Amphibian Man quickly applies his healing abilities himself, and slashes Strickland's throat, killing him. Before he dies, Strickland remarks, \"You really are a god.\" As the police arrive on the scene with Zelda, the Amphibian Man takes Elisa and jumps into the canal where he heals her. When he applies his healing ability underwater to the scars on Elisa's neck, they open to reveal gills like his; she jolts back to life and the two embrace. In a closing voice-over narration, Giles conveys his belief that Elisa lived \"happily ever after\" and \"remained in love\" with the Amphibian Man.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sally Hawkins]] as Elisa Esposito\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Richard Strickland\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Giles\n* [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as \"The Amphibian Man\"<!-- The film and its featurettes use this name in credits -->\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as Robert Hoffstetler / Dimitri Mosenkov\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Zelda Delilah Fuller\n* [[Nick Searcy]] as [[General of the Air Force]] Frank Hoyt\n* [[David Hewlett]] as Fleming\n* [[Nigel Bennett]] as Mihalkov\n* Stewart Arnott as Bernard\n* [[Lauren Lee Smith]] as Elaine Strickland\n* Martin Roach as Brewster Fuller\n* [[John Kapelos]] as Mr. Arzoumanian\n* [[Morgan Kelly]] as Pie Guy\n* [[Wendy Lyon]] as Sally\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Still from the Creature from the Black Lagoon (15666911261).jpg|thumb|The [[Gill-man]] from ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' was an inspiration for del Toro's concept.]]\nThe film was directed by [[Guillermo del Toro]] from a screenplay he co-wrote with [[Vanessa Taylor]].<ref name=\"BBFC\">{{Cite web |title=The Shape of Water |url=https://www.bbfc.co.uk/release/the-shape-of-water-q29sbgvjdglvbjpwwc0zodm5nti |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171221031355/http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/shape-water-2017 |archive-date=December 21, 2017 |access-date=December 19, 2020 |publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification]]}}</ref> Del Toro formed the idea for ''The Shape of Water'' over breakfast in December 2011 with [[Daniel Kraus (author)|Daniel Kraus]], his future collaborator on the novel ''[[Trollhunters: Tales of Arcadia|Trollhunters]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Potter |first=Janet |date=March 1, 2018 |title=How an Evanston writer's boyhood idea inspired 'Shape of Water' |url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/daniel-kraus-the-shape-of-water-guillermo-del-toro-george-a-romero/Content?oid=42049844 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418054236/https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/daniel-kraus-the-shape-of-water-guillermo-del-toro-george-a-romero/Content?oid=42049844 |archive-date=April 21, 2021 |access-date=April 21, 2021 |website=[[Chicago Reader]]}}</ref> It was primarily inspired by del Toro's childhood memories of seeing ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' (1954) and wanting to see the [[Gill-man]] and Kay Lawrence (played by [[Julie Adams]]) succeed in their romance.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Iconic Horror Movie Scene That Inspired 'The Shape of Water' |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3457493/iconic-horror-movie-scene-inspired-shape-water/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014233850/http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3457493/iconic-horror-movie-scene-inspired-shape-water/ |archive-date=October 14, 2017 |access-date=October 16, 2017 |website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=September 6, 2017 }}</ref> When del Toro was in talks with [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] to direct a remake of ''Creature from the Black Lagoon'', he tried pitching a version focused more on the creature's perspective, where the Creature ended up together with the female lead, but the studio executives rejected the concept.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Del Toro Talks Black Lagoon Influence On \"Shape\" |url=https://www.darkhorizons.com/del-toro-talks-black-lagoon-influence-on-shape/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201035326/https://www.darkhorizons.com/del-toro-talks-black-lagoon-influence-on-shape/ |archive-date=December 1, 2017 |access-date=November 20, 2017 |website=darkhorizons.com|date=November 5, 2017 }}</ref> Additionally, the film also shows similarities to the 2015 short film ''The Space Between Us''.<ref>{{Cite news |date=August 18, 2017 |title=Is 'The Shape of Water' Cribbed Directly From the Short Film 'The Space Between Us'? |work=AwardsWatch |url=http://awardswatch.com/2017/08/18/is-the-shape-of-water-cribbed-directly-from-the-short-film-the-space-between-us/ |url-status=dead |access-date=September 11, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911161739/http://awardswatch.com/2017/08/18/is-the-shape-of-water-cribbed-directly-from-the-short-film-the-space-between-us/ |archive-date=September 11, 2017}}</ref> In placing the film in the 1960s, del Toro said \"the movie is a movie about our problems today and about demonizing the other and about fearing or hating the other, and how that is a much more destructive position than learning to love and understand [...] if I say once upon a time in 1962, it becomes a fairy tale for troubled times.

In an interview with [[NPR]], Jones said his initial reaction to learning the creature would also be a romantic lead was \"utter terror\" but trusted the director to expand the character's development. As Jones wanted to portray a creature distinct from others in monster films, he practiced a variety of movements in a dance studio.

In January 2017, Desplat was shown a rough cut of the finished film, and finding it similar to a musical, he agreed to compose a score. As a result, Desplat tried to capture the sound of water extensively to have audiences experience a \"warm feeling\" that is also caused by love. In an interview, he said the melody from the opening scene was \"actually made of waves. I did not do that on purpose, but by being completely immersed in this love and these water elements, I wrote a melody that plays [[arpeggio]]s like waves.\"<ref name=\"Music\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/12/the-shape-of-water-alexandre-desplat-oscars-interview-1202220056/|title='The Shape Of Water' Composer Alexandre Desplat On The Sounds Of Love & Water|date=December 30, 2017|first=Matt|last=Grobar|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=July 6, 2021|archive-date=January 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190124041733/https://deadline.com/2017/12/the-shape-of-water-alexandre-desplat-oscars-interview-1202220056/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWriting the film score took six weeks; it was purposely composed to create the sense of immersion and to give the \"sense that you, yourself, are floating\". The two melodies, one titled \"Elisa's Theme\", are heard at the beginning of the film and later merge into a single piece of music by the end of it. To emphasize this effect and its final result, Desplat changed the sounds of the accompanying flutes, accordions, and whistles to \"something blurred\". On composing the score overall, he said that it was \"a matter of sculpting the music and making it take the shape of the storyline.\" As a result, Desplat opted out of giving Shannon's character a melody.<ref name=\"Music\" />\n\nThe music for ''The Shape of Water'' was released on December 1, 2017, by [[Decca Records]].
