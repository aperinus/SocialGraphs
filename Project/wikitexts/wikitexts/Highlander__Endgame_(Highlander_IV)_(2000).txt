It is the fourth theatrical release in the [[Highlander (franchise)|''Highlander'' film series]] and it serves as a continuation of both the ''Highlander'' film from 1986 and the [[Highlander: The Series|''Highlander'' television series]] (including the latter's spin-off ''[[Highlander: The Raven]]''). The film reunites [[Duncan MacLeod]], the lead character of the series, and [[Connor MacLeod]], the lead character of the films. In the film, the Macleods need to deal against a new enemy named Jacob Kell, a powerful immortal who is willing to break any rule to win the Prize. This marks Lambert's fifth and final appearance as Connor. ''Highlander: Endgame'' was released on September 1, 2000.  A stand-alone sequel, ''[[Highlander: The Source]]'' was released seven years later, with Paul reprising his role.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=August 2021}}\nIn A.D. 1555, Connor MacLeod ([[Christopher Lambert]]) returns to his former home in [[Glenfinnan]], [[Scotland]], to save his mother from his former friend and village priest Jacob Kell ([[Bruce Payne]]). Kell executes Connor's mother for [[witchcraft]]. Enraged, Connor kills both Kell and Kell's adoptive father, Father Rainey, and sets Glenfinnan ablaze before leaving with his mother's body. Jacob Kell is reborn as an Immortal, and vows hypocritical vengeance against Connor for Rainey's death. He spends the next four centuries killing people Connor cares about. Kell amasses great power by ignoring the rules of The Game; he recruits several lesser Immortals as disciples, who overpower other Immortals so Kell can take their heads.\n\nSome time after leading to the events of [[Highlander (film)|the original film]], the death of [[the Kurgan]], and ten years before the present-day events of the current film, Kell orchestrates the death of Connor's adopted daughter [[Rachel Ellenstein]]. Heartbroken, Connor departs for [[Watcher (Highlander)#The Sanctuary|The Sanctuary]], where Immortals are under surveillance by a subgroup of [[Watcher (Highlander)|Watchers]] to prevent [[Immortal (Highlander)#The Prize|The Prize]] from being won.\n\nA decade later, Kell and his disciples attack the Sanctuary, and Connor is believed to have been beheaded along with the other Immortals there. [[Duncan MacLeod]] ([[Adrian Paul]]), compelled by a vision he has of the slaughter, begins to investigate. Meanwhile, Matthew Hale, the Watcher supervising the sanctuary, looks on at the carnage, and decides that they will now turn to \"volunteers\" to refill their test-subjects' numbers. Duncan goes to see [[Methos]], who tells him about the Sanctuary. Duncan cannot believe that Connor would even go to such a place. He later leaves London for New York, where he goes to Connor's NYC loft, which was destroyed in the explosion that killed Rachel. Sensing an Immortal, he turns to see Kate ([[Lisa Barbuscia]]), his wife from 200 years before. Then Kell's posse arrives, and fights Duncan (disregarding the rule of one-on-one combat). The fighting stops when Kell arrives, but Carlos shoots Duncan, who falls on a spike, rendering him unconscious. Kell is furious with Carlos, and beheads him &ndash; as the [[Quickening (Highlander)|Quickening]] begins, a van drives up to where Duncan fell, and takes him away.\n\nLater on, Duncan wakes up, only to realize that he has been taken by Watchers who want to keep him in the Sanctuary so that the Prize cannot be won by any Immortal. He is later saved with the help of Methos and [[Joe Dawson (Highlander)|Watcher Joe Dawson]]. Joe warns Duncan about Kell and how powerful he has become, having already taken a total of 661 immortal heads. He discovers Connor was spared by Kell, so as to allow the evil Immortal to make Connor's life even more miserable. Kell wants to kill Duncan in order to torture Connor, and given the number of Quickenings he has received, this seems quite likely to occur. Additionally, Connor is too guilt-ridden by the deaths of all his loved ones to stand up to Kell by himself. Duncan later confronts Kate (now using the alias \"Faith\") at a fashion-shoot, and asks her why she is with Kell. She tells him how much she hates the fact that she will never have children or grow old and die, and believes that Kell understands her pain. Duncan must earn her forgiveness, or face her as an embittered part of Kell's faction. Later on in his hotel room, Kate arrives after having a chat with Kell, and the two make love. Duncan touches the scar that was caused when he made her Immortal, and apologizes to Faith for what he did. Though it would appear that she has forgiven him, it is not the case, and she tells Duncan that she will never forgive him; Duncan tells her that it is never too late for redemption, and that he will wait, even if it takes years or centuries.\n\nUltimately, Kell executes his group in a mock [[Last Supper]] to gain their powers, including possibly Faith. Later on a rooftop, Connor meets Duncan and intentionally starts a sword-fight with him. Telling him that neither one of them can defeat Kell alone, Connor convinces Duncan that he must allow himself to be beheaded in order for Duncan to have enough power to rival Kell. After an emotional goodbye, Duncan ends the fight with respect and honor, sorrowfully beheading his beloved clansman, Connor.\n\nSoon after, Duncan and Kell engage in a final battle. At first, Kell easily overpowers Duncan, even when MacLeod attempts a supposedly-unbeatable sword move that Connor taught him. Hale attempts to interfere and take Duncan back to the Sanctuary, but Joe arrives and shoots him dead. Just before Duncan's impending death at the hands of Kell, Connor's spirit takes control of Duncan, which gives him the strength to continue. Duncan then kills Kell by jumping over him and decapitating him as he turns around, avenging Connor and all of Connor's loved ones. Duncan absorbs all of Kell's massive power, taking his place as the most powerful immortal in existence. He then goes to [[Glen Coe|Glencoe]], [[Scotland]] to bury Connor next to Connor's first wife [[Heather MacLeod|Heather]] and mentor [[Juan S\u00e1nchez Villa-Lobos Ram\u00edrez|Ram\u00edrez]].\n\nProducer's Cut: After Duncan's visit to Glencoe to bury Connor, Kate appears and explains that Kell spared her life. After proclaiming that her \"Faith\"-persona is \"dead,\" and that she is giving \"Kate\" another try, she and Duncan share a kiss, suggesting that they will reconcile their marriage, and live together forever.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Adrian Paul]] as [[Duncan MacLeod]]\n* [[Christopher Lambert]] as [[Connor MacLeod]]\n* [[Bruce Payne]] as Jacob Kell\n* [[Lisa Barbuscia]] as Kate Devaney MacLeod / Faith\n* [[Donnie Yen]] as Jin Ke\n* [[Jim Byrnes (actor)|Jim Byrnes]] as [[Joe Dawson (Highlander)|Joe Dawson]]\n* [[Peter Wingfield]] as [[Methos]]\n* [[Damon Dash]] as Carlos Dash\n* [[Beatie Edney]] as Heather MacDonald MacLeod\n* [[Sheila Gish]] as Rachel Ellenstein\n* [[Oris Erhuero]] as Winston Erhuero\n* [[Ian Paul Cassidy]] as Cracker Bob\n* [[Edge (wrestler)|Adam \"Edge\" Copeland]] as Lachlan\n* June Watson as Caiolin MacLeod\n* [[Donald Douglas (Scottish actor)|Donald Douglas]] as Father Rainey\n* [[Doug Aarniokoski]] as Kirk\n\n==Production==\nEarly drafts of the screenplay differed greatly from the final cut in several respects. The Kate character was originally named \"Alexis\"; most of the flashback scenes occurred in [[Shanghai, China|Shanghai]] instead of [[Ireland]]; [[Paris, France|Paris]] was the original location of [[Methos]]'s home rather than [[London, England|London]]; Duncan MacLeod lived on his Parisian barge during the modern-day sequences; and [[Hugh Fitzcairn]] appeared during the Shanghai flashbacks. The titles of the various drafts included ''Highlander IV: The Immortals'', ''Highlander: The Search for Connor'', and ''Highlander: World Without End''. [[Gregory Widen]], writer of the original ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'', worked on the early drafts and was in talks to direct the film. Widen had previously directed the film ''[[The Prophecy]]'', which he also wrote. Portions of Widen's writing were used for ''Endgame'', though he received only a \"Characters Created By\" credit.\n\nThe film features several shots from the original ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]''. The first is a computer-altered and enhanced shot of [[Glenfinnan]], which was originally the shot of Connor walking away from his village. The second is a shot of the Silvercup sign, pulled from the scene of [[the Kurgan]] taking Brenda Wyatt to the building. And in the rooftop [[Quickening (Highlander)|Quickening]], two shots of Connor and [[Heather MacLeod]] together are taken from the first film. [[Castle Stalker]] is seen briefly in the film during Connor's flashback scene. This building was also seen in ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''.<ref>[http://www.scotlandthemovie.com/movies/h4stalker.html Scotland: the Movie Location Guide \u2014 ''Highlander: Endgame'' \u2014 Castle Stalker]. Scotlandthemovie.com. Retrieved on 2011-06-20.</ref>\n\n[[Donnie Yen]] served as the film's martial arts choreographer and also played the role of Jin Ke, who was based on a real historical figure: [[Jing Ke]], renowned for his failed assassination of the Chinese emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]]. Hip-Hop producer [[Damon Dash]]  makes an appearance as one of Jacob Kell's Immortal minions. Professional wrestler [[Edge (wrestler)|Adam Copeland]], known as \"Edge\" in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF, now WWE), makes a [[cameo appearance]] as Lachlan. A reference is made to Copeland's wrestling persona when Duncan says to Lachlan, \"Looks like you've lost your edge, lad.\"\n\nThe movie was meant to act as a bridge between ''[[Highlander: The Series]]'' and the spin-off series ''[[Highlander: The Raven]]'' which was continuing on television back in 1999. But these plans started to go awry when ''Raven'' was canceled due to low ratings and the change in syndication, as well as production delays, started occurring due to cast availability problems. [[Dimension Films]], which took on the project as a way of invigorating the film series, realized that its plans for the film were not going to meet expectations, and scaled back on its release.\n\nFilming began on October 22, 1999, and ended on March 7, 2000. Much of the bulk of filming happened in [[Romania]], a decision which was opposed by the producers.\n\n''Endgame''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s theatrical distributor, Dimension Films, demanded that cuts be made to the film to give it a faster pace. The deleted footage contained [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] necessary to understanding the ''Highlander'' universe, resulting in a theatrical cut that was criticized for being incomprehensible to audiences unfamiliar with the earlier films.<ref>\"For the viewer not familiar with the peculiar universe of ''Highlander'', the movie is virtually incomprehensible.\" \u2014 Jesse Shanks, [http://digitallyobsessed.com/showtheaterreview.php3?ID=27 ''Highlander: Endgame'' review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110073013/http://digitallyobsessed.com/showtheaterreview.php3?ID=27 |date=2009-11-10 }}, Digitally Obsessed</ref><ref>\"...non- fans will be wondering what the heck is going on.\" \u2014 [http://ottawa.film-can.com/REVIEWS/highlander.html ''Highlander: Endgame'' review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143325/http://ottawa.film-can.com/REVIEWS/highlander.html |date=2008-12-05 }}, FilmCan</ref><ref name=\"EW\">[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,277493,00.html ''Highlander: Endgame'' review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011122324/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,277493,00.html |date=2008-10-11 }}, Lisa Schwarzbaum, Entertainment Weekly</ref> An extended cut with restored footage was later released on DVD. (See alternate versions below.)\n\n==Alternative versions==\nThe DVD release features a 101-minute \"[[director's cut|producers' cut]]\" which features improved visual effects, sound mixing, and [[color-timing]], and restores numerous scenes of [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] intended to make the story more easily understandable for audiences unfamiliar with the ''Highlander'' franchise. The \"producers' cut\" includes the \"Kate lives\" ending and removes the line of dialogue in which [[Methos]] refers to the Sanctuary as holy ground, which was criticized by fans.<ref name=DVDcom>''Highlander: Endgame'' / Audio Commentary by Peter Davis (Producer), William Panzer (Producer), Robert A. Ferretti (Editor), and H. Daniel Gross (Co-Executive Producer / Dimension Home Video (2007) / Region 1 DVD</ref>\n\nThe [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] (United States and Canada) DVD includes, as a bonus feature, a rough [[workprint]] cut of the film. The visual quality of the rough cut is rather poor, with unfinished special effects and a [[timecode]] visible at all times, and alternating between widescreen and full-screen. This cut features a subplot involving Connor giving a Christmas tree to an orphanage every Christmas, an activity picked up by Duncan after Connor's death. Kate does not appear in this version of the film at its conclusion, unlike the producers' cut included on the DVD. The rough cut also notably features an extended version of the \"Last Supper\" scene in which Jin Ke plunges his sword into a wall and beheads himself after realizing that he cannot beat Kell, thereby denying Kell the opportunity to kill him. In the other versions of the film, this scene was edited to make it appear that Kell beheads Jin Ke (off-screen) along with the rest of the group.\n\n===Producers cut===\n\nThe producers of the film disagreed with Dimension Films over the running length and story structure of the film. They were unsatisfied with the theatrical cut, and upon its DVD release, they re-edited the film and added twelve minutes of new footage, which included:\n* A new opening sequence, in which we see Duncan and Connor roaming the streets of New York and Duncan buying a hot dog. Connor tells Duncan that he has an errand to run, and leaves a concerned Duncan behind after telling him to \"watch his back.\" The scene goes to Rachel walking towards the antiques store.\n* The shots of the photographs with Rachel and Connor in them are not in the DVD cut. Instead we see Rachel enter the store, go to the loft and find a TV playing a video of herself and Connor at various points of her life. The phone rings and when she answers, the store explodes just as Connor walks up to it.\n* The DVD cut has Duncan walking past a payphone on his way to [[Methos]].  He answers the phone and a woman (later revealed as Faith) tells him, \"Whatever you fear about Connor MacLeod, fear the worst.\" She says that she is a friend and hangs up. As Duncan walks on, we see a watcher named Matthew spying on Duncan from a cafe saying into his cellphone, \"He's on the move.\"\n* During the scene where Duncan is at Connor's destroyed loft, the posse enter and Winston says, \"It's time to show our Immortal brother a thing or two.\" Cracker Bob has more of an entrance.  We see him crash in on his motorcycle swings his bat and says, \"Someone order a club sandwich?\" Duncan mocks his outfit and Bob complains to Faith.\n* A Flashback to Kate and Duncan's wedding is re-edited. We see Duncan sitting at the table with Kate, and one of their friends gets drunk and collapses while urging the two to kiss. They do, then we see Duncan, Kate and their wedding guest dancing. From there, we see Connor walking through the door and embracing Duncan.\n* After Duncan and Faith separate at the studio (the fashion show scene), we see them roaming the streets. Faith goes to Kell's temple, then her apartment.  Inside, we see Kell waiting for her. The dialogue makes it clear that they have a sexual relationship and Kell suspects that she may turn over to Duncan's side. We go from this scene to Faith walking about the streets of New York and then entering Duncan's hotel room where they have an intimate moment.\n* The fight scene between Duncan and Kell is extended.\n* We see a scene where Duncan is bandaging a leg wound and taking off his coat. The watcher Matthew is pointing a rifle at him.  \"Just watching,\" someone says. Matthew turns and Joe is standing behind him. Matthew raises his rifle at Joe, but Joe shoots him with a revolver. Matthew dies.\n* Duncan's face morphing into Connor's, and back, a few times is reduced in their visibility and intensity.\n\nAmong other changes was the edited blurring of a large [[JVC]] billboard that was prominently featured during Connor's death scene in the theatrical cut.\n\n==Theatrical trailer==\nThe trailers for the film feature several shots showing Kell using mystical abilities (such as stopping a sword in midair with some sort of force field, cloning himself and holding an orb with Connor's screaming head inside of it). Also, Connor and Duncan are shown emerging from some sort of portal. None of this footage made it into any released version of the film, and the footage is only seen in the trailer. No explanation for the nature of these scenes has ever been willingly{{Weasel inline|date=November 2016}} released by the producers or film studio, although it has since been revealed{{By whom|date=November 2016}} that these shots were never intended for inclusion in any finished cut of the movie \u2014 they were shot exclusively for its trailer, instead.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} No mention of Kell's magical abilities exists in the online version of an early screenplay.\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 11% based on reviews from 54 critics, with an average rating of 3.30/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"The fourth and supposedly last ''Highlander'' movie is a confusing mess, complete with bad acting and dialogue.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/highlander_endgame |title=Highlander: Endgame (2000) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]] |access-date=2021-04-30}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 21 out of 100 based on 16 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/highlander-endgame |title=Highlander: Endgame Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref>\n\n[[Elvis Mitchell]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave ''Endgame'' a mildly positive review, saying: \"It's nice to see mindless violence back in a [[B movie|B picture]], where it belongs, and the swordplay is impressive.

The only reason why this film earns one-half of a star instead of zero is due to some unintended laughs.

Cheap special effects that look cool, weak characters that still pull heartstrings, and a bunch of actors no one really knows unless you have seen this or that obscure flick.

Lambert's character has nowhere to go, and his once-magnetic glower is tired and worn. Several opportunities for spectacular action are squandered because the movie's villain has a tendency to execute summarily his own henchmen. Paul's modicum of charisma, director Douglas Aarniokoski's broad panoramas that recall the original ''Highlander'', and Lambert's amusing skirmishes with a Scottish accent are not enough to provide any redeeming value.<ref>[http://www.aboutfilm.com/movies/h/highlanderendgame.htm Highlander: Endgame Review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517050047/http://www.aboutfilm.com/movies/h/highlanderendgame.htm |date=2008-05-17 }}, Carlo Cavagna, About Film, October 2000</ref>\n\n==Box office==\nAt the North American box office, the film opened at #5, grossing $6,223,330 in its opening weekend.
