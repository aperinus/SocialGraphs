The film debuted at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 1993, where it received critical praise.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}} After receiving an [[NC-17]] rating from the [[MPAA]], the film was given an R rating on appeal and released in the United States in September 1993. It was a critical and financial failure.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe movie follows a surgeon whose growing obsession with a woman leads him to hold her captive in his home after she suffers a car accident and to amputate her limbs to keep her captive.\n\nNick Cavanaugh is a lonely [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] surgeon obsessed with Helena, with whom he had one intimate experience, but she disdains him. After she suffers a [[Gustilo open fracture classification|high-grade tibial fracture]] in a hit-and-run motor vehicle collision in front of his home, Nick kidnaps Helena and surreptitiously treats her in his home, amputating both her legs above the knee. Later, after she tries to choke him, Nick amputates her arms above the elbow.\n\nThough Helena is the victim of Nick's kidnapping and mutilation, she dominates the dialogue with constant ridicule of his shortcomings. But this was all a dream: Helena awakes in the hospital with all her limbs intact.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sherilyn Fenn]] as Helena<ref>{{cite news|title= Boxing Helena Rated NC-17|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=January 14, 1993|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-01-14/entertainment/ca-1663_1_helena-rated-nc-17|access-date=October 24, 2010|first=David J.|last=Fox}}</ref>\n* [[Julian Sands]] as Nick Cavanaugh\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as Ray O'Malley\n* [[Kurtwood Smith]] as Alan Palmer\n* [[Art Garfunkel]] as Lawrence Augustine\n* Betsy Clark as Anne Garrett\n* Nicolette Scorsese as Fantasy Lover/Nurse\n* Meg Register as Marion Cavanaugh\n* Bryan Smith as Russell\n* Marla Levine as Patricia\n* Kim Lentz as Nurse Diane\n* Lloyd T.

In writing, Lynch was inspired by some elements from her own childhood, telling ''Vice'' that being born with [[club feet]], and her grandmother owning a ''[[Venus de Milo]]'' replica, influenced her insight into the characters:<ref name=\"Vice\"/>\n\n<blockquote>It always struck me the way people looked at the Venus. They didn't see her as broken, they saw her as beautiful. And it really made a huge impact on me. I thought I was broken and that maybe someday someone would find me beautiful. So this idea of a damaged boy who was in an obsessive situation who would try to recreate from his own view the one thing that didn't hit him or abandon him was this armless, beautiful woman. And therefore in a dream recreate this obsessive thing where we take from one another until we are the size and shape that we think the other person should be for us.<ref name=\"Vice\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] was slated to play Helena, but shortly before filming was to begin in January 1991 she dropped out, halting the production.<ref name=\"Insandout\">{{cite news|last1=Thompson|first1=Anne|title=FILM; The Ins and Outs of 'Boxing Helena'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/05/movies/film-the-ins-and-outs-of-boxing-helena.html |website=The New York Times|date=July 5, 1992|access-date=18 November 2016}}</ref> The next month, in an attempt to salvage the film, Lynch met with [[Kim Basinger]] about playing Helena.
