The film was directed by [[Jay Chandrasekhar]] and released on August 5, 2005, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. As in the television series, the film depicts the adventures of cousins Bo, Luke, and Daisy, and their Uncle Jesse, as they outfox crooked Hazzard County Commissioner [[Boss Hogg]] and [[Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane]].\n\nThe film was the acting debut of pop singer [[Jessica Simpson]]. While financially successful with an opening debut of 30 million and a worldwide gross of 111 million, the film met with generally negative reviews from critics. The film was followed by a [[direct-to-video]] [[prequel]] titled ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning]]'' (2007).\n\n==Plot==\nCousins [[Bo Duke|Bo]], [[Luke Duke|Luke]], and [[Daisy Duke]] run a [[moonshine]] business for their Uncle Jesse in [[The Dukes of Hazzard|Hazzard County, Georgia]]. The cousins' primary mode of transportation is an orange 1969 [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]] that the boys affectionately refer to as the \"[[General Lee (car)|General Lee]]\". Along the way, the family is tormented by corrupt Hazzard County Commissioner [[Boss Hogg|Jefferson Davis Hogg]], widely known as \"Boss Hogg\", and his willing but dimwitted [[henchman]], [[Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane]].\n\nAfter Rosco has the General Lee vandalised after Bo and Luke's attempt to run away from a daughter of one their many moonshine customers, Billy Prickett, a famous stock-car driver, enters Hazzard to participate in the rally. Meanwhile, Rosco plants a fake moonshine still (\"'cause he's too dumb to find the real one\") in Uncle Jesse's barn and seizes the Duke property in the interest of [[eminent domain]] for Boss Hogg, forcing the family to temporarily reside with neighbor and Uncle Jesse's love-interest, Pauline. Pauline informs the Dukes that Rosco seized another farm on charges, so Bo and Luke investigate a local construction site and find geologic core samples with the help of bait-shop owner Sheev. Meanwhile, at the local auto body shop run by the Dukes' friend Cooter Davenport has made a start on repairing the General Lee after it was damaged. Rosco then arrives and informs Cooter that he intends to seize the General Lee as \"evidence\", hearing this instead of just repairing the damage Rosco inflicted to the car earlier, with help turns the General Lee into a hot rod and applies a new horn, new paint job (including the Confederate flag and General Lee lettering on the roof) aswell as welding the doors shut (unable to fix them), in return for finally getting payment for all the work he has done (\"...'cause that's how this works...\") for the boys in the past.\n\n[[Image:Dukes-of-hazzard-sheriff-car.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sheriff's car at location in Thousand Oaks, California]]\nRosco arrives before Bo and Luke can leave but the pair escape straight after Rosco opens the gates to the yard, they attempt to chase after Bo and Luke but thanks to the help of Cooter are left with flat tyres preventing them from chasing after the General Lee. The Dukes go to Atlanta to visit a local university geology lab, meeting with Katie-Lynn Johnson, a Hazzard county girl and the Duke boys' love interest, and her Australian roommate Annette. At the lab, pretending to be scientists they discover Boss Hogg's intentions of turning the county into a strip coal mine. They inform Uncle Jesse about what Boss Hogg plans to do to Hazzard County and he tells them to get back to Hazzard County as fast as possible. While stopped at a set of lights however they get ambushed by a group of black gangsters who threaten them for pretending to be black (Bo and Luke's faces were covered in soot), before a fight can break out all of them except Katie and Annette are arrested by [[Atlanta Police Department]] (the pair had earlier run from campus police after under speeding). Back in Hazzard, Daisy learns, with the help of Sheriff's Deputy Enos Strate, that Billy Prickett has been hired by Boss Hogg to participate in the rally as a ringer. Boss Hogg then heads to Atlanta, where he informs the Duke boys, in lock-up, that they are too late to stop him and reveals that the vote on Hogg's proposition is at the same time as the rally, explaining Billy Prickett's involvement. During a transfer from detainment, Daisy helps the boys escape from the patrol car, and they speed home to try to inform the townsfolk, escaping the Atlanta Police, and the [[Georgia State Patrol]] after Bo outmaneuvers the city cops (who's furious at Luke after finding out that he and Katie-Lynn snuck up into the Dukes\u2019 hayloft without him knowing about it).\n\nUpon returning home, the Dukes discover that Boss Hogg and Rosco had taken Uncle Jesse and Pauline hostage, an obvious trap for the boys, and that Billy is in on the scheme because he is ashamed of the town's low status. The two race to the farmhouse to cause a distraction to the waiting Hazzard County Sheriff's deputies and Georgia State Troopers, while Daisy and Cooter rescue Jesse and Pauline. Meanwhile, the college girls head to the rally with Sheev to inform the townsfolk about the vote on the strip-mining ordinance. Because of Sheev's armadillo hat and lack of pants, no one listens to him, so Bo leaves for the rally while Luke and Jesse team up to foil the county and state police who are chasing Bo, interfering with the race. Upon crossing the finish line first before Billy, the two then continue racing across town, leading the townsfolk to the courthouse. Meanwhile other Hazzard County Sheriff's deputies and Georgia State Troopers had placed a roadblock before the courthouse, and after Daisy failed to get help claiming that her car had broken down thanks to a female officer seeing through her ruse, using Cooter's tow truck as a ramp, Bo jumps over the roadblock. Luke, having stolen Boss Hogg's car, smashes through the roadblock, allowing the townsfolk to arrive just in time to vote against Boss Hogg's proposed ordinance. At the courthouse, Boss Hogg attempt's to have the boys locked up but Daisy takes advantage of the governor of Georgia's presence and TV cameras to convince him to pardoning the boys, so Uncle Jesse takes the opportunity to knock out Boss Hogg and gets a pardon for assaulting a county commissioner at the same time.\n\nThe final scene shows a cook-out at the Dukes' house where Pauline convinces Uncle Jesse, who could not be found because he was \"using the meat smoker\", to get up and play the [[Theme from \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" (Good Ol' Boys)|television series' main theme]]. Bo and Luke are romantically involved with the girls in the General Lee (Luke with Katie & Bo with Annette) when they are caught by Luke's other love-interest Laurie Pullman from the introduction of the film who points a shotgun at them, realising she is about to fire after cocking the gun Luke shouts ''Go Bo Go'' with Bo responding ''Luke You Manwhore''. Laurie proceeds to chase them with the shotgun as they drive away.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Dukes of Hazzard Premiere.jpg|thumb|right|Knoxville and Scott at the premiere]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Johnny Knoxville]] as [[Luke Duke]]\n* [[Seann William Scott]] as [[Bo Duke]]\n* [[Jessica Simpson]] as [[Daisy Duke]]\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as [[Boss Hogg]]\n* [[Willie Nelson]] as Uncle Jesse Duke\n* [[David Koechner]] as Cooter Davenport\n* [[M.

Schneider has also questioned why TV channels show the film but are not prepared to rerun the original series.{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}}\n\n==Differences From Source Material==\n* In the series, Bo and Luke Duke were on probation, and Jesse had quit moonshining to keep them out of prison. A frequent obstacle as the result of their probation was their inability to leave Hazzard County without the consent of Boss Hogg. In the film, the Dukes are still actively producing and distributing moonshine, and Bo and Luke freely travel to Atlanta.\n* Boss Hogg and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane are portrayed as far more serious and sinister than their TV counterparts. In the series, Hogg was very opposed to violence and would often abandon schemes if any characters were put in harm's way. In the film, Hogg has Jesse and Pauline (an original character) held hostage in one scene, and pays for an annoying prisoner to be knocked unconscious in another.\n* When the series portrayed the origins of the General Lee, the car immediately showcased its iconic design. In the opening of the film, the design of the General is rather different, with a crudely-styled 01 on the doors and missing the Confederate flag and name above the windows. When Cooter restores the General after it is vandalized by Boss Hogg's associates, the classic design is applied.\n* In most of the series, the Hazzard County Police Department is limited to Sheriff Coltrane and one deputy. (Enos or Cletus) In the film, the police department seems to be rather extensive for a small town.\n* In the series, Luke was a former Sergeant of the [[U.S. Marine Corps]]. This is not mentioned in the film. Contrarily, in the film, Jesse is introduced as a [[Korean War]] veteran, though the series did not portray him as a veteran.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Anchor|Soundtrack|Jessica Simpson version}}\n{{Main|These Boots Are Made for Walkin'#Jessica Simpson version}}\nJessica Simpson recorded her own version of \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\" (and added her own lyrics) for the [[soundtrack]] to the film.
