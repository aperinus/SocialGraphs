It is an adaptation of the 1909 play ''[[Anne Pedersdotter (play)|Anne Pedersdotter]]'' by [[Hans Wiers-Jenssen]], based on a [[Anne Pedersdotter|16th century Norwegian case]]. The film tells the story of a young woman who is forced into a marriage with an elderly pastor after her late mother was accused of [[witchcraft]]. She falls in love with the pastor's son and also comes under suspicion of witchcraft.\n\nThe film was produced during the Nazi [[Occupation of Denmark]], and Dreyer left the country for Sweden after its release. It has received very positive reviews, despite initial criticisms for slow pacing.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a Danish village in 1623, an old woman known as Herlof's Marte is accused of witchcraft. [[Anne Pedersdotter|Anne]], a young woman, is married to the aged local pastor, [[Absalon Pederss\u00f8n Beyer|Absalon Pedersson]], who is involved with the [[Witch-hunt|trials of witches]], and they live in a house shared with his strict, domineering mother Meret. Meret does not approve of Anne, who is much younger than her husband, being about the same age as the son from his first marriage. Anne gives Herlof's Marte refuge, but Marte is soon discovered in the house, though she is presumed to have hidden herself there without assistance. Herlof's Marte knows that Anne's mother, already dead at the time of the events depicted, had been accused of witchcraft as well, and had been spared thanks to Absalon's intervention, who aimed at marrying young Anne.  Anne is thus informed by Herlof's Marte of her mother's power over people's life and death and becomes intrigued in the matter.\n\nAbsalon's son from his first marriage, Martin, returns home from abroad and he and Anne are immediately attracted to each other. She does not love her husband and thinks he does not love her. Under torture, Herlof's Marte confesses to witchcraft, defined among other evidence as wishing for the death of other people.  She threatens to expose Anne if Absalon does not rescue her from a guilty verdict, begging him to save her as he saved Anne's mother. Marte, after pleading with Absalon a second time, does not betray his secret and is [[Execution by burning|executed by burning]] with the villagers looking on. Absalon feels his guilt over having saved Anne's mother, but leaving Marte to burn. Anne and Martin, clandestinely growing closer, are seen as having changed in recent days, fueling Meret's suspicion of Anne's character. Anne is heard laughing in Martin's company by her husband, something which has not occurred in their time together. Absalon regrets that he married Anne without regarding her feelings and true intentions, and tells her so, apologizing for stealing her youth and happiness.\n\nA violent storm erupts while Absalon is away visiting a dying young parishioner, Laurentius.  He had been cursed by Herlof's Marte during her interrogation and she foretold an imminent death.  Meanwhile, Anne and Martin are discussing the future, and she is forced to admit wishing her husband dead, but only as an \"if\" rather than it actually happening. At that moment Absalon, on his way home, feels \"like the touching of Death itself.\" On Absalon's return, Anne confesses her love for Martin to her husband and tells him she wishes him dead.  He collapses and dies, calling Martin's name. Anne screams. The following morning Martin is overcome by his own doubts.  Anne declares that she had nothing to do with his father's death, which she sees as providential help from above to release her from her present misery and unhappy marriage. At Absalon's funeral, Anne is denounced by Meret, her mother-in-law, as a witch. Anne initially denies the charge, but when Martin sides with his grandmother she is faced with the loss of his love and trust, and she confesses on her husband's open coffin that she murdered him and enchanted his son with the Devil's help. Her fate appears sealed.{{sfn|Dreyer|1970|pp=133-235}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Thorkild Roose]] as [[Absalon Pederss\u00f8n Beyer|Rev.

He had spent the previous eleven years working as a journalist and unsuccessfully attempting to launch such film projects as an adaptation of ''[[Madame Bovary]]'', a documentary on Africa and a film about [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart]].{{sfn|Milne|1971|p=121}}\n\nDreyer had first seen Wiers-Jenssen's play ''Anne Pedersdotter'' in 1925 and had wanted to adapt it to the screen for several years.{{sfn|Dreyer|1970|p=17}} It differs slightly from the original play, such as the scene where Anne and Martin first meet and kiss. In Wiers-Jenssen's play they are hesitant and shy, while in Dreyer's film they are bluntly sexual.{{sfn|Dreyer|1970|p=18}}\n\nDreyer's producers had wanted him to cast [[Eyvind Johan-Svendsen]] in the role of Absalon, but Dreyer thought the actor was too much of \"a Renaissance man\" and preferred to cast an actor that could project the austerity that he wanted.{{sfn|Milne|1971|p=147}} [[Lisbeth Movin]] was cast after being asked to meet with Dreyer.

To depict it, Svierkier was tied to a wooden ladder, and Dreyer left her there while the rest of the cast and crew went for lunch, over the objections of [[Preben Lerdorff Rye]] and [[Thorkild Roose]]. When they returned, Svierkier was perspiring profusely, which is visible in the film.<ref>{{cite AV media|people=Torben Skjodt Jensen (Director) |date=1995 |title=[[Carl Th.
