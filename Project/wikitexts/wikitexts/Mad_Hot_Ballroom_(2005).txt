Told from the students' perspectives as the children strive toward the final citywide competition, the film chronicles the experiences of students at three schools in the neighborhoods of [[Tribeca]], [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn|Bensonhurst]] and [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]]. The students are united by an interest in the ballroom dancing lessons, which builds over a 10-week period and culminates in a competition to find the school that has produced the best dancers in the city. As the teachers cajole their students to learn the intricacies of the various disciplines, Agrelo intersperses classroom footage with the students' musings on life; many of these reveal an underlying maturity.<ref name=\"Rotten\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe documentary premiered at the 2005 [[Slamdance Film Festival]] in [[Park City, Utah]] and was purchased by [[Paramount Vantage|Paramount Classics]] and [[Nickelodeon Movies]].
