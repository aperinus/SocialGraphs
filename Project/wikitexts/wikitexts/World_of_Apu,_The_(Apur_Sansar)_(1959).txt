It is based on the second half of [[Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay]]'s novel ''Aparajito''. Following ''[[Pather Panchali]]'' (1955) and ''[[Aparajito]]'' (1956), ''The World of Apu'' is the final part of Ray's ''[[The Apu Trilogy]]'', about the childhood and early adulthood of a young [[Bengali people|Bengali]] named Apu in early twentieth century India. ''The World of Apu'' stars [[Soumitra Chatterjee]] (as Apu) and [[Sharmila Tagore]] (as Apu's wife Aparna); the duo would go on to appear in many subsequent Ray films.\n\nUpon its release on 1 May 1959, ''The World of Apu'' was well-received by critics. It won the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film]] as well as several international awards, including the [[Sutherland Trophy|Sutherland Award for Best Original And Imaginative Film]] and [[National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn early 1940s, Apurba Kumar Roy (Apu) is an unemployed graduate (completed study up to the intermediate science) living in a rented room at [[Tala, Calcutta]]. Despite his teacher's advice to go for higher studies, he is unable to do so because he cannot afford it. He tries to find a job, while barely getting by providing private tutoring. His main passion is writing a novel, partially based on his own life, hoping to get it published some day. One day, he meets his old friend Pulu, who coaxes him to join him on a trip to his village in [[Khulna]] to attend the marriage of a cousin named Aparna.\n\nOn the day of the marriage, it is revealed that the bridegroom has a serious mental disorder. The bride's mother cancels the marriage, despite the father's protests. He and the other villagers believe, according to prevalent Hindu tradition, that the young bride must be wedded off during the previously appointed [[Auspicious wedding dates|auspicious]] hour, otherwise, she will have to remain unmarried all her life. Apu, after initially refusing when requested by a few villagers, ultimately decides to take Pulu's advice and come to the rescue of the bride by agreeing to marry her. He returns with Aparna to his apartment in Calcutta after the wedding. He takes up a clerical job, and a loving relationship begins to bloom between them. Yet, the young couple's blissful days are cut short when Aparna [[Maternal mortality in fiction|dies while giving birth]] to their son, Kajal. Apu is overcome with grief and holds the child responsible for his wife's death.\n\nHe shuns his worldly responsibilities and becomes a recluse \u2013 travelling to different corners of India, while the child is left with his maternal grandparents. Meanwhile, Apu throws away his manuscript for the novel he had been writing over the years. A few years later, Pulu finds Kajal growing wild and uncared for. He then seeks out Apu, who is working at a mining quarry and advises Apu one last time to take up his fatherly responsibility. At last, Apu decides to come back to reality and reunite with his son. When he reaches his in-laws' place, Kajal, having seen him for the first time in his life, at first does not accept him as a father. Eventually, he accepts Apu as a friend and they return to Calcutta together to start life afresh.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Soumitra Chatterjee]] as Apu (Apurba Kumar Roy)\n* [[Sharmila Tagore]] as Aparna, Apu's wife\n* Swapan Mukherjee as Pulu\n* Alok Chakravarty as Kajal\n* Sefalika Devi as Sasinarayan's wife\n* Dhiresh Majumdar as Sasinarayan\n* Dhiren Ghosh as the landlord\n\n==Production==\nRay wanted fresh faces again for the film like other two films in the [[Apu Trilogy]] and thus he started auditioning. In others films he made in between, like ''[[Parash Pathar]]'' (1958) and ''[[Jalsaghar]]'' (1958), he did work with professional actors like [[Soumitra Chatterjee]], a radio announcer and a stage actor who, with doyen of [[Bengali theatre]] [[Sisir Bhaduri]], had first auditioned for the role of the adolescent Apu in ''[[Aparajito]]'' (1956). Though Ray thought he had the right look, he found him too old for the role. Ray remembered him and offered the role of adult Apu two years later. {{Sfn|Ray|1996|p=131}} Chatterjee was still unaware that he had already been selected for the title role. He had gone on the sets of Ray's fourth film, ''[[Jalsaghar]]'', to watch the shoot. That day, while he was leaving the sets, Ray called him over and introduced him to actor [[Chhabi Biswas]], saying, \"This is Soumitra Chattopadhyay; he's playing Apu in my next film ''Apur Sansar''\", leaving him surprised.<ref>{{cite news| title = Soumitra Chatterjee on his master Satyajit Ray | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/books/Soumitra-Chatterjee-on-his-master-Satyajit-Ray/articleshow/34684501.cms|date=9 May 2014| access-date = 2014-05-21| newspaper =The Times of India}}</ref> Ray however had a tough time finding an actress for the female lead Aparna. He even placed an ad in a local daily asking for photographs from girls between ages of 15 and 17. There were over a thousand responses to the ad, but Ray found none of them worth auditioning. This was when Ray became aware of a girl, [[Sharmila Tagore]], who had recently performed at a dance recital at Children's Little Theatre (CLT) in Kolkata. She is related to poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and subsequently auditioned and was selected.{{Sfn|Ray|1996|p=131}}\n\nDespite being selected, as a debutant actor, Chatterjee was nevertheless unsure of his career choice and especially his looks, as he did not consider himself photogenic. However, on 9 August 1958, when the first shot of the film was given an okay in one take, he realized he had found his vocation.<ref name=cnn>{{cite web| author=Anuradha SenGupta|title = Being Soumitra Chatterjee: Star of the East|publisher=CNN-IBN| url = http://ibnlive.in.com/news/being-soumitra-chatterjee-star-of-the-east/67961-19.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081201175954/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/being-soumitra-chatterjee-star-of-the-east/67961-19.html| url-status = dead| archive-date = 1 December 2008|date=29 June 2008| access-date = 2014-05-21 }}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n;[[National Film Awards]] (India)\n* '''Winner''' \u2013 [[7th National Film Awards|1959]] \u2013 [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film|President's gold medal for the All India Best Feature Film]]<ref name=\"7thawardPDF\">{{cite web|url=http://dff.nic.in/2011/7th_nff.pdf|title=7th National Film Awards|publisher=[[Directorate of Film Festivals]]|access-date=4 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n;[[British Film Institute|British Film Institute Awards]] ([[London Film Festival]])\n*'''Winner''' \u2013 1960 \u2013 [[Sutherland Trophy|Sutherland Award for Best Original And Imaginative Film]]\n\n;14th [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]]\n*'''Winner''' \u2013 1960 \u2013 Diploma Of Merit\n\n;[[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures|National Board of Review Awards]] (United States)\n*'''Winner''' \u2013 [[National Board of Review Awards 1960|1960]] \u2013 [[National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Film]]\n\n;[[British Academy Film Awards]] (United Kingdom)\n*Nominated \u2013 [[15th British Academy Film Awards|1962]] \u2013 [[BAFTA Award for Best Film]]\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n[[File:President John F.
