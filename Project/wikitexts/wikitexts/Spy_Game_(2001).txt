The film grossed $62 million in the United States and $143 million worldwide on a $115 million budget, and received mostly positive reviews from film critics.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1991, the [[United States]] and [[China]] are close to a major trade agreement, with the [[President of the United States|President]] due to visit [[China]] to seal the deal. The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) learns that its asset Tom Bishop has been arrested at a [[People's Liberation Army]] prison in [[Suzhou]] and will be executed in 24 hours, unless the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] claims him and bargains for his release. Bishop's actions, unsanctioned by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], risk jeopardizing the agreement. A group of CIA executives summon Nathan D. Muir, a veteran [[Agent handling#Case officer|case officer]] and Bishop's mentor, who plans to retire from the Agency at the end of the day. While purportedly interviewing Muir to learn his history with Bishop, the executives seek a pretext for not intervening on Bishop's imprisonment. Unknown to them, Muir was tipped off about Bishop's capture by a fellow CIA veteran Harry Duncan in [[Hong Kong]].\n\nMuir leaks the story to [[CNN]] through an [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] contact, Digby 'Digger' Gibson in Hong Kong, believing that public pressure would force American intervention. They are stalled briefly before a phone call to the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] from [[Deputy Director of CIA for Operations|Deputy Director for Operations]] Charles Harker results in CNN retracting the story as a hoax. Muir met Bishop in 1975, when Bishop was a [[United States Marine Corps Scout Sniper]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. Muir gives Bishop a mission to eliminate a high-ranking [[People's Army of Vietnam|North Vietnamese military]] officer. Bishop and his spotter Tran are able to assassinate the target despite being compromised, though Bishop takes out a pursuing enemy attack chopper. Bishop escorts the now wounded Tran to safety, impressing Muir. In 1976, Muir recruited Bishop as a CIA asset in [[West Berlin|Berlin]], where Bishop was tasked with procuring assets in [[East Germany]]. Then he discusses Bishop's spy work in [[Beirut]] in 1985, during the [[War of the Camps]], which was their last mission together.\n\nIn a series of flashbacks, Bishop is troubled by Muir's conviction that civilian \"assets\" who endangered a mission should be sacrificed to preserve the \"greater good.\" After Bishop attempts to countermand Muir during a mission to save the life of an asset, Muir emphasizes that he will not tolerate dissent, and would not rescue Bishop if he was captured going \"off the reservation\". During a mission in [[Lebanon]], Bishop, posing as a [[Photojournalism|photojournalist]], meets relief worker Elizabeth Hadley. While using her to connect with an asset for the mission, they became romantically involved. Muir distrusts Hadley, and reveals to Bishop that she was exiled from the [[United Kingdom]]. Hadley later confesses to Bishop that she was involved in the bombing of a Chinese building in Britain, which was supposed to be empty but contained Chinese nationals. Bishop reveals to Hadley his true identity. Muir elects again to sacrifice a civilian asset for the sake of their mission, and Bishop cuts professional ties with Muir. Muir, fearing that Hadley could threaten the Agency and potentially Bishop, makes a deal with the Chinese, exchanging Hadley in return for an arrested U.S. diplomat. Chinese agents kidnap Hadley, and a [[Dear John letter]] is forged and left for Bishop.\n\nIn the present, Muir realizes that Bishop went to China for Hadley. In a series of misdirections, he forges a directive signed by the [[Director of Central Intelligence]] to begin \"Operation Dinner Out\", a rescue mission spearheaded by a [[United States Navy SEALs|SEAL]] team that Bishop had developed as a \"Plan B\" for his own attempt at rescuing Hadley. Using [[United States dollar|$]]282,000 of his life savings and a misappropriated file on Chinese coastline satellite imagery, Muir enlists Duncan to assist him in bribing a Chinese energy official to cut power to the prison for 30 minutes, during which time the SEAL rescue team will retrieve Bishop and Hadley. Harker is suspicious that Muir is working against the CIA, but when he confronts Muir before the gathered executives, Muir \"confesses\" to unprofessionally using company resources to gather information about his intended retirement home, which he has distorted the evidence to support. Bishop is rescued along with Hadley, and surmises that Muir was responsible for saving him when he hears the helicopter pilot refer to \"Operation Dinner Out\", which was also the code name for an operation Bishop used to get a birthday gift for Muir while they were in Lebanon. When the CIA officials are belatedly informed of the rescue, Muir has already left the building and is seen driving safely off into the countryside.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Robert Redford]] as CIA Case Officer Nathan D.
