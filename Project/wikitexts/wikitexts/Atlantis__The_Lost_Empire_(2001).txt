Written by [[Tab Murphy]], directed by [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], and produced by [[Don Hahn]], the film features an ensemble cast with the voices of [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Cree Summer]], [[James Garner]], [[Leonard Nimoy]], [[Don Novello]], [[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]], [[Claudia Christian]], [[Jacqueline Obradors]], [[Jim Varney]] (in his final film role), [[Florence Stanley]], [[John Mahoney]], [[David Ogden Stiers]] and [[Corey Burton]]. Set in 1914, the film tells the story of young linguist Milo Thatch, who gains possession of a sacred book, which he believes will guide him and a crew of mercenaries to the lost city of [[Atlantis]].\n\nDevelopment of the film began after production had finished on ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1996). Instead of another [[Musical film|musical]], the production team decided to do an action-adventure film inspired by the works of [[Jules Verne]]. ''Atlantis'' was notable for adopting the distinctive visual style of comic book creator [[Mike Mignola]], one of the film's [[production design]]ers. The film made greater use of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) than any of Disney's previous [[Traditional animation|traditionally animated]] features, and remains one of the few to have been shot in [[anamorphic format]]. [[Linguistics|Linguist]] [[Marc Okrand]] [[Constructed language|constructed]] an [[Atlantean language]] specifically for use in ''Atlantis''. [[James Newton Howard]] provided the film's score. The film was released at a time when audience interest in animated films was shifting away from hand-drawn animation toward films with full CGI.\n\n''Atlantis: The Lost Empire'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in [[Hollywood, California]] on June 3, 2001, and went into general release on June 15. The film received mixed reviews from critics. Budgeted at around {{Nowrap|$90\u2013120 million}}, ''Atlantis'' grossed over {{Nowrap|$186 million}} worldwide, {{Nowrap|$84 million}} of which was earned in North America; its lackluster box office response was identified as being released in competition with ''[[Shrek]]'' and ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]''. As a result of the film's underperformance, Disney quietly cancelled a planned spin-off television series ''Team Atlantis'' and underwater [[Disneyland]] attraction based on it. ''Atlantis'' was nominated for a number of awards, including seven [[Annie Award]]s, and won Best Sound Editing at the 2002 [[Motion Picture Sound Editors|Golden Reel Awards]]. The film was released on VHS and DVD on January 29, 2002, and on [[Blu-ray]] on June 11, 2013. Despite its initial reception, re-evaluation in later years has resulted in ''Atlantis'' gaining a [[cult following]] and appraisal from critics as a mistreated classic, due in part to Mignola's unique artistic influence.<ref name=\"GizmoGem\">{{cite web |date= August 28, 2015 |first= Katharine |last= Trendacosta |title= Atlantis: The Lost Empire Is a Beautiful Gem of a Movie That Deserved Better Than It Got |website= Gizmodo |url= https://gizmodo.com/atlantis-the-lost-empire-is-a-beautiful-gem-of-a-movie-1727214546 |access-date= December 10, 2021 |archive-date= April 21, 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210421210953/https://io9.gizmodo.com/atlantis-the-lost-empire-is-a-beautiful-gem-of-a-movie-1727214546 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://insidethemagic.net/2020/12/atlantis-the-lost-disney-classic-lt1/|title='Atlantis': The Lost Disney Classic|date=April 22, 2021|website=insidethemagic.net|access-date=April 22, 2021|archive-date=April 21, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210421210956/https://insidethemagic.net/2020/12/atlantis-the-lost-disney-classic-lt1/|url-status=live}}</ref> A direct-to-video sequel, ''[[Atlantis: Milo's Return]]'', was released in 2003.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words according to WP:FILMPLOT guidelines. The plot summary is an overview of the film's main events, not minute details such as dialogue, scene-by-scene breakdowns, and technical detail. -->\nIn 6,800 BC, an explosion sends a [[tsunami]] towards the city of [[Atlantis]]. The Queen leaves Princess Kida behind and is lifted up into a floating crystal, which merges with the Queen and creates a protective dome over the city's innermost district, which sinks beneath the waves.\n\n8,800 years later, in 1914, Milo Thatch, a [[Smithsonian Institution]] linguist who is ridiculed for his dream of finding Atlantis, is introduced by Helga Sinclair to eccentric millionaire Preston B. Whitmore, an old friend of Milo\u2019s grandfather. Whitmore reveals that he made a bet with Milo\u2019s grandfather to fund an expedition to Atlantis and gives Milo the Shepherd\u2019s Journal, a book describing the history and path to Atlantis, offering him a place in the expedition. The expedition is headed by Commander Rourke and includes Helga; demolitions expert Vinny; geologist Moli\u00e8re; medical officer Dr. Sweet; mechanic Audrey; radio operator Mrs. Packard; chef Cookie; and dozens of soldiers. Their submarine the ''Ulysses'' is attacked and destroyed by a mechanical leviathan guarding the entrance to Atlantis, leaving only a handful of survivors. Following the journal, they travel through a dormant volcano and eventually arrive at Atlantis, where they are met by the still young Princess Kida.\n\nAgainst her father's wishes, Kida enlists Milo to help Atlantis regain its glory, as its culture and knowledge have been decaying for centuries. Milo learns that a huge crystal, the Heart of Atlantis, gives the people longevity, and once powered their devices via smaller crystals they all wear. He also discovers that Rourke and the rest of the crew have known all along of the crystal and used the expedition as part of Rourke's evil plan to steal it and destroy Atlantis. Rourke fatally punches the king when he refuses to give up the location of the crystal but discovers the crystal\u2019s chamber regardless. Sensing the threat, the crystal merges with Kida. Rourke imprisons her in a crate, whereupon Milo convinces the crew to turn on Rourke, unwilling to be party to an innocent people's extinction. Rourke, Helga, and the soldiers start for the surface with Kida and destroy the bridge to trap the others behind. The dying King gives Milo his own crystal, explaining that he had tried to weaponize the Heart which caused the prior explosion and the fate of his wife. He says the crystal must have a royal host when the city is in danger, and begs Milo to save Atlantis and Kida, who will be lost to the crystal forever if not separated from it in time.\n\nMilo and his friends rally the Atlanteans to reactivate their flying machines and pursue the mercenaries. They quickly defeat Rourke's men, but he and Helga nearly escape with Kida. Rourke betrays Helga and throws her death. As she dies, she shoots the [[dirigible|airship]] containing Kida's crate. Fighting on the burning airship over the Heart, Milo slashes Rourke with a crystal-charged shard of glass, turning Rourke into a crystal monster before being shattered by the airship's propellers, killing him. The airship awakens the volcano as it crash-lands. Milo and the rest flee back to Atlantis with Kida, who, still merged with the crystal, rises into the sky and awakens ancient Stone Guardians, who rise from the flooded portion of Atlantis, creating a dome to protect it from the lava flow. Once the danger is neutralized, the Crystal returns Kida, alive, to Milo. \n\nMilo, as a reward for saving Atlantis from Rourke and Helga, elects to stay in Atlantis with Kida, with whom he has fallen in love, and the rest return to the surface, promising to keep their adventures secret to preserve Atlantis's safety. During the film's [[epilogue]], Whitmore alone learns the truth, from photographs taken by Mrs. Packard as well as an Atleantean crystal sent to him by Milo.\n\n==Voice cast==\n<!--In-universe details about the characters belong in the plot section according to WP:FILMCAST guidelines, please reconsider adding such material to this section as it will most likely be reverted.-->\n[[File:Atlantis Milo kida production.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A penciled production sketch showing a man (Milo) on the left embracing a woman (Kida) on the right.

Wise chose Garner because of his previous experience with [[action film]]s, especially [[War film|war]] and [[Western (genre)|Western]] films, and said the role \"fits him like a glove\". When asked if he would be interested in the role, Garner replied: \"I'd do it in a heartbeat.\"<ref>[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Animation Production: The Voices of Atlantis'' at 3:50\u20134:31]]</ref>\n* [[Cree Summer]] as Kidagakash \"Kida\" Nedakh, the Princess of Atlantis and Milo's love interest. Kida's supervising animator, Randy Haycock, stated that Summer was very \"intimidating\" when he first met her; this influenced how he wanted Kida to look and act on screen when she meets Milo.<ref>[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Animation Production: The Voices of Atlantis'' at 2:32\u20132:50]]</ref> \n** Natalie Strom provided dialogue for Kida as a young child.\n** Summer also voiced the unnamed Queen of Atlantis, Kida's mother and Kashekim's wife who was \"chosen\" by the Crystal during the sinking of the city.\n* [[Don Novello]] as Vincenzo \"Vinny\" Santorini, an [[Italians|Italian]] [[Demolition|demolitions expert]]. Kirk Wise and [[Russ Edmonds]], Vinny's supervising animator, noted Novello's unique ability to [[improvisation|improvise]] dialogue. Edmonds recalled, \"[Novello] would look at the sheet, and he would read the line that was written once, and he would never read it again!

Sweet's supervising animator, [[Ron Husband]], indicated that one of the challenges was animating Sweet in sync with Morris' rapid line delivery while keeping him believable. Morris stated that this character was extreme, with \"no middle ground\"; he mentioned, \"When he was happy, he was ''really'' happy, and when he's solemn, he's ''real'' solemn.\"<ref>[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Animation Production: The Voices of Atlantis'' at 8:20\u20139:13]]</ref>\n* [[Claudia Christian]] as Lieutenant Helga Katrina Sinclair, Rourke's German second-in-command and lieutenant.

Harcourt, a board member of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] who dismisses Milo's belief in the existence of Atlantis. Stiers previously worked with Michael J. Fox in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]''. He earlier voice-acted for Disney in ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' as Cogsworth, ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' as Governor Ratcliffe and Wiggins, and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' as the Archdeacon and would do so again in ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'' as Jumba.\n* [[John Mahoney]] as Preston B. Whitmore, an eccentric millionaire who funds the expedition to Atlantis. [[Lloyd Bridges]] was originally cast and recorded as Whitmore, but he died before completing the film. Mahoney's zest and vigor led to Whitmore's personality being reworked for the film.<ref>[[#Kurtti01|Kurtti 2001, p. 15.]]</ref> Mahoney stated that doing voice work was \"freeing\" and allowed him to be \"big\" and \"outrageous\" with his character.<ref name=\"Cast\">[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Animation Production: The Voices of Atlantis'' at 4:55\u20135:07]]</ref>\n* [[Jim Varney]] as Jebidiah Allardyce \"Cookie\" Farnsworth, a Western-style [[chuckwagon]] chef. Varney died of lung cancer in February 2000, before the production ended, and the film was dedicated to his memory. Producer Don Hahn was saddened that Varney never saw the finished film, but mentioned that he was shown clips of his character's performance during his site sessions and said, \"He loved it.\" Shawn Keller, supervising animator for Cookie, stated, \"It was kind of a sad fact that [Varney] knew that he was not going to be able to see this film before he passed away.

Burton mentioned that finding his performance as Mole was by allowing the character to \"leap out\" of him while making funny voices. To get into character during his recording sessions, he stated that he would \"throw myself into the scene and feel like I'm in this make-believe world\".<ref>[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Animation Production: The Voices of Atlantis'' at 6:55\u20137:10]]</ref>\n* [[Leonard Nimoy]] as Kashekim Nedakh, the King of Atlantis and Kida's father.

An entire sequence is devoted to having dinner and going to bed.

The original version featured a [[Viking]] war party using ''The Shepherd's Journal'' to find Atlantis and being swiftly dispatched by the Leviathan. Near the end of production, story supervisor John Sanford told the directors that he felt this prologue did not give viewers enough emotional involvement with the Atlanteans. Despite knowing that the Viking prologue was finished and it would cost additional time and money to alter the scene, the directors agreed with Sanford. Trousdale went home and completed the [[storyboards]] later that evening.

With the ability to operate in the z-plane, this camera moved through a digital [[Wire-frame model|wire-frame set]]; the background and details were later hand-drawn over the wireframes.

Approaching it as a live-action film, Howard decided to have different musical themes for the cultures of the surface world and Atlantis. In the case of Atlantis, Howard chose an [[Gamelan|Indonesian orchestral sound]] incorporating chimes, bells, and gongs. The directors told Howard that the film would have a number of key scenes without dialogue; the score would need to convey emotionally what the viewer was seeing on screen.<ref>[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Music and Sound'' at 5:00\u20138:45]]</ref>\n\n[[Gary Rydstrom]] and his team at [[Skywalker Sound]] were hired for the film's [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound production]].<ref>[[#DVD1|''Audio Commentary'' at 1:50\u20132:10]]</ref> Like Howard, Rydstrom employed different sounds for the two cultures. Focusing on the machine and mechanical sounds of the early industrial era for the explorers, he felt that the Atlanteans should have a \"more organic\" sound utilizing ceramics and pottery. The sound made by the Atlantean flying-fish vehicles posed a particular challenge. Rydstrom revealed that he was sitting at the side of a highway recording one day when a [[Semi-trailer truck|semi-truck]] drove by at high speed. When the recording was sped up on his computer, he felt it sounded very organic, and decided to use it in the film. Rydstrom created the [[harmonic]] chiming of the Heart of Atlantis by rubbing his finger along the edge of a champagne flute, and the sound of sub-pods moving through the water with a [[Oral irrigator|water pick]].<ref>[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Music and Sound'' at 0:05\u20134:48]]</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Atlantis: The Lost Empire'' had its world premiere at Disney's [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Hollywood, California on June 3, 2001<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/010601/laf080a.html|title= World Premiere of Walt Disney Pictures' ATLANTIS: THE LOST EMPIRE \u2013 Update|date=June 1, 2001|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|access-date= September 22, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010615001509/http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/010601/laf080a.html|archive-date=June 15, 2001}}</ref> and a limited release in New York City and Los Angeles on June 8; a wider release followed on June 15.<ref name=\"BOM\"/><ref name=\"USAToday\"/> At the premiere, ''Destination: Atlantis'' was on display, featuring behind-the-scenes props from the film and information on the legend of Atlantis with video games, displays, laser tag, and other attractions.
