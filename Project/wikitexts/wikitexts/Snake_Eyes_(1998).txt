De Palma also co-wrote the story with [[David Koepp]], who wrote the screenplay. The film stars [[Nicolas Cage]] as a detective investigating an assassination at a boxing match in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]].\n\nThe film was released and produced by [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Touchstone Pictures]] on August 7, 1998. The film garnered mixed reviews from critics, criticizing the film's story, writing and pacing while praising its style and the performances. It grossed $104 million worldwide against a $73 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nOn a dark and stormy night, corrupt, flamboyant [[Atlantic City]] police detective Rick Santoro ([[Nicolas Cage]]) attends a [[boxing]] match at Gilbert Powell's ([[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]]) Atlantic City Arena between heavyweight champion Lincoln Tyler ([[Stan Shaw]]) and challenger Jose Pacifico Ruiz. He meets up with his best friend since childhood, [[U.S. Navy]] [[Commander (United States)#Naval|Commander]] Kevin Dunne ([[Gary Sinise]]), who is working with the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to escort [[United States Secretary of Defense|Defense Secretary]] Charles Kirkland ([[Joel Fabiani]]) and Powell at the fight after a trip to [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Virginia]].\n\nAs the first round begins, Kevin is distracted by an attractive redhead named Serena ([[Jayne Heitmeyer]]) who wears a ruby ring, and leaves his seat, which is then taken by Julia Costello ([[Carla Gugino]]), a mysterious woman with platinum blonde hair and a white [[satin]] suit. When Ruiz unexpectedly knocks out Tyler, gunshots ring out, mortally wounding Kirkland and grazing Julia, who loses her glasses and blonde wig, revealing her naturally dark hair. Kevin kills the sniper and orders the arena to be locked down. Despite the lockdown, Julia escapes into the [[casino]], covers her wounds in pieces of cloth from her blouse and, after stealing a black satin jacket, disguises herself as a hooker.\n\nRick notices that the \"knocked out\" Tyler awoke instantly when the shots rang out and, after studying the fight tape, realizes the knockout punch didn't connect. Tyler confesses that he threw the fight in order to pay gambling debts, but he was never told that anyone would be killed and reveals that Serena, the redhead who tricked Kevin into leaving his post, paid him to take a dive. With Tyler, Serena and the sniper, along with the man who signaled Tyler to go down and whoever gave him the go-ahead, involved, Rick, suspecting a conspiracy, reveals everything he has learned to Kevin, who confesses that the trip to Norfolk was to test the AirGuard missile defense system, which Powell's company was backing. He deduces that the sniper, a known [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] terrorist named Tarik Ben Rabat, assassinated Kirkland over the Pentagon's large-scale defense cooperation with and weapons systems transfers to Israel.\n\nRick studies surveillance footage to find Serena while Kevin continues searching for Julia, aided by Powell's security guards. However, once they split up, it is revealed that Kevin is actually the fifth party and masterminded the conspiracy. He kills the now-blonde Serena and Zeitz (the man who signaled Tyler to go down) in order to prevent their further involvement and then conceals their bodies, aided by his bodyguards. Kevin then enlists Tyler by revealing the truth to him.\n\nJulia seduces Ned Campbell ([[David Anthony Higgins]]), a sleazy guest at the hotel, so she can hide in his room. Both Rick and Kevin discover this simultaneously and give chase, but Rick reaches her first and takes her into protective custody. In a stairwell, Julia confesses that she is an analyst who worked on the AirGuard tests and discovered the results were faked to make the missile defense system look like it was working when it actually was not; the system failed to work and she tipped off Kirkland to the deception. However, Kevin discovered her actions and arranged the entire conspiracy to kill both her and Kirkland, using Rabat's background as a rabidly anti-Israel terrorist to have him kill the SECDEF and then be immediately killed off himself. Rick discovers Kevin's involvement and, despite initially refusing to believe it, quickly accepts the truth. After hiding Julia in a warehouse, Rick inspects the footage of a new floating camera and discovers proof of his friend's involvement.\n\nKevin confronts Rick and confesses that his motive was to prevent any further attacks on U.S. ships, similar to one on the USS ''Renville'', where Kevin had to leave several men to drown in order to prevent the ship from sinking following an Iraqi missile strike. He offers Rick one million dollars for Julia's location. When Rick refuses, since the only thing he said is that Julia did nothing wrong, Kevin has Tyler beat him up, but he still does not give in. Kevin plants a tracker on Rick and follows him to the warehouse just as a [[hurricane]] hits Atlantic City. When a tidal wave hits the [[boardwalk (entertainment district)|boardwalk]], Rick uses it as cover to rush Julia outside, where the police, tipped off by Rick, are waiting and witness Kevin opening fire (one of the bullets, instead of striking Julia, smashing the windshield). Kevin shouts to the police that Julia is a suspect, but to no avail. Unable to escape the police and a news crew, Kevin commits suicide during the live news feed.\n\nRick is later hailed as a hero, but the press soon uncovers his corruption and he loses his job and family. Before reporting for his prison term, Rick meets Julia on the boardwalk. She thanks him for his help, as Powell is completely restructuring his company and scrapping the AirGuard. Rick promises to call when he gets out in twelve to eighteen months. Ultimately, Serena's ruby ring is seen embedded in one of the concrete pillars of the new Powell Millennium Arena.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Detective Rick Santoro\n* [[Gary Sinise]] as Commander Kevin Dunne\n* [[Carla Gugino]] as Julia Costello\n* [[Joel Fabiani]] as US Secretary of Defense Charles Kirkland\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Gilbert Powell, Defense Contractor\n* [[Stan Shaw]] as Lincoln \"The Atlantic City Executioner\" Tyler\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Lou Logan, Reporter\n* [[Michael Rispoli]] as Jimmy George, Bookie\n* [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]] as Cyrus, Drug Dealer\n* [[David Anthony Higgins]] as Ned Campbell\n* [[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]] as Walt McGahn\n* [[Peter McRobbie]] as FBI Agent Gordon Pritzker \n* [[Tamara Tunie]] as Anthea, Reporter\n* [[Chip Zien]] as Mickey Alter, Tyler's Lawyer\n* [[Jayne Heitmeyer]] as Serena, The Redhead\n* Chip Chuipka as Zeitz, The Drunk Who Shouts \"Here Comes The Pain!\"\n* Eric Hoziel as Tarik Ben Rabat, The Assassin\n* Richard Zeman as Agent #1\n* Richard Lemire as Agent #2\n* Adam C.
