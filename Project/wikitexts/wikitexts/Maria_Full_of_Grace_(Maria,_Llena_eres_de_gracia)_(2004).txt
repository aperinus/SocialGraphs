The film was produced between Colombia and the United States. The story follows a Colombian girl who becomes a drug mule for a trafficking ring. Lead actress [[Catalina Sandino Moreno]] was named Best Actress at the [[Berlin Film Festival]], and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] in the [[77th Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nSeventeen-year-old [[Colombia]]n girl Maria \u00c1lvarez works in [[sweatshop]]-like conditions at a flower plantation. Her income helps support her family, including an unemployed sister who is a single mother, but after unjust treatment from her boss, she quits her job de-thorning roses, despite her family's vehement disapproval. Shortly thereafter, Maria discovers she is pregnant by her boyfriend, and he suggests marriage, but she declines because she does not feel she loves him, or that he loves her. On her way to [[Bogot\u00e1]] to find a new job, she is offered a position as a [[Mule (smuggling)|drug mule]]. Desperate, she accepts the risky offer, and swallows 62 wrapped pellets of drugs, and flies to [[New York City]] with her friend Blanca, who has also been recruited as a drug mule.\n\nMaria is almost caught by U.S. customs who are suspicious after finding Maria's $800 in cash and wanting to make a surprise visit to a sister she \"hasn't seen in years\", but not knowing anywhere else to go if she isn't home. She tells them that the father of her child paid for her plane ticket. She avoids being [[X-ray]]ed due to her pregnancy, and is released. The traffickers collect Maria, Blanca, and Lucy, another more experienced mule that Maria had befriended during her recruitment. The mules are held in a motel room until they pass all the drug pellets. Lucy falls ill when a drug pellet apparently ruptures inside her. Unknown to the traffickers, Maria witnesses them carrying Lucy out of the hotel room, and she sees blood stains in the bathtub. She comes to the conclusion that the traffickers cut her open to retrieve the other drug pellets inside her body. Scared, Maria convinces Blanca to escape with her while the traffickers are gone. They leave with the drugs they have passed.\n\nMaria has nowhere to sleep, and goes to Lucy's sister's house, but doesn't reveal to the sister that Lucy is dead. Blanca soon joins her there. Eventually the sister unexpectedly hears of their involvement in her sister's death and throws them out. Blanca and Maria make an agreement to return the drugs to the traffickers and receive their money. Maria uses some of her drug money to send Lucy's body home to [[Colombia]] for a proper burial. Maria and Blanca are ready to board the plane back to Colombia when Maria decides to stay in the United States. Blanca returns home without Maria.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Catalina Sandino Moreno]] as Maria \u00c1lvarez \n* John \u00c1lex Toro as Franklin\n* Johanna Andrea Mora as Diana \u00c1lvarez\n* Virginia Ariza as Juana\n* Yenny Paola Vega as Blanca\n* Guilied Lopez as Lucy D\u00edaz\n* [[Patricia Rae]] as Carla\n* Rodrigo S\u00e1nchez Borhorquez as the supervisor\n* Charles Albert Pati\u00f1o as Felipe\n* Wilson Guerrero as Juan\n* Fabricio Suarez, Mateo Suarez as Pacho\n* Evangelina Morales as Rosita\n* Juana Guarderas as a pharmacist\n* Jaime Osorio G\u00f3mez as Javier\n* Victor Macias as Pellet maker\n* [[Selenis Leyva]] as Customs Inspector\n\n== Release ==\n''Maria Full of Grace'' was first shown on 18 January at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in the [[United States]].
