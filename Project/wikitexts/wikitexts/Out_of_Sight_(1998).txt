The first of several collaborations between Soderbergh and actor [[George Clooney]], it was released on June 26, 1998.\n\nThe film stars Clooney and [[Jennifer Lopez]] and co-stars [[Ving Rhames]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Dennis Farina]], [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]], [[Steve Zahn]], [[Catherine Keener]], and [[Albert Brooks]]. There are also special appearances by [[Michael Keaton]], briefly reprising his role as Ray Nicolette from [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Jackie Brown (film)|Jackie Brown]]'' the previous year, and [[Samuel L. Jackson]].\n\nThe film received [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]]. It won the [[Edgar Award]] for [[List of Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Motion Picture Screenplay winners|Best Screenplay]] and the [[National Society of Film Critics]] awards for Best Film, Best Director, and Best Screenplay. The film led to a short-lived spinoff TV series in 2003 titled ''[[Karen Sisco]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nCareer [[bank robber]] Jack Foley is caught after a spur-of-the-moment robbery in [[Miami]]. Sent to [[Glades Correctional Institution]], he deduces that fellow inmate Chino is orchestrating a breakout. Planning his own escape, Jack calls his ex-wife Adele, an out-of-work [[magician's assistant]], to notify his friend and accomplice Buddy.\n\nThat night, [[U.S. Marshal]] Karen Sisco arrives at the prison, as does Buddy, and spots the escapees tunneling outside. In the confusion, Jack exits the tunnel in a guard's uniform and overpowers Karen. They are forced to share the trunk of her car as Buddy drives them to meet Glenn, an unreliable associate. Karen convinces Glenn to drive off with her, but he crashes the car and flees while she is taken to the hospital.\n\nKaren has a dream about tracking Jack down, but instead of arresting him, they have sex. Determined to join the task force hunting the fugitives, she questions Adele and happens to arrest Chino, who arrives seeking revenge on Jack. Karen is forced to wait in the lobby while the task force raids Buddy\u2019s apartment, but she and Jack spot each other as he and Buddy escape.\n\nTwo years earlier, Jack, Buddy, and Glenn were incarcerated at [[United States Penitentiary, Lompoc|Lompoc Penitentiary]], where wealthy inmate Richard Ripley bragged to Glenn about a cache of [[rough diamond|uncut diamonds]] hidden at his home in [[Detroit]]. Jack saved Richard from being extorted by vicious criminal Maurice \"Snoopy\" Miller, leading Richard to promise Jack a job. After his release, Jack balked at the menial position and Richard's disdain for his criminal past. Thrown out of the building, he impulsively robbed the bank across the street and was sent to Glades.\n\nIn Detroit, Maurice plans to steal the diamonds with his brother-in-law Kenneth, henchman White Boy Bob, and a reluctant Glenn, whom Maurice forces to help kill a rival drug dealer. Jack and Buddy meet Maurice and his crew, agreeing to team up on the robbery. Following Jack to Detroit, Karen questions Maurice's wife Moselle, and defends herself when Kenneth attempts to assault her. Jack finds Karen at her hotel, where they share a romantic interlude at the bar and spend the night together.\n\nGlenn gets cold feet and runs into Karen, who lets him escape but continues to tail Jack. The thieves force their way inside Richard's mansion, but the housekeeper Midge tells them Richard is out of town. While Maurice and his crew struggle to shoot open the safe upstairs, Jack and Buddy find Richard hiding in his study, and discover the diamonds hidden in his fish tank. Richard, in love with Midge, refuses to leave without her and is captured by Maurice.\n\nJack sends Buddy away with the diamonds and goes back with Buddy's gun. He is held at gunpoint by White Boy Bob, who trips on the stairs and accidentally shoots himself in the head. Jack shoots Kenneth as he attempts to rape Midge, while Karen enters and shoots Maurice in self-defense. Unwilling to return to prison, Jack confronts Karen with his empty gun, imploring her to kill him. Instead, Karen wounds him in the leg and arrests him.\n\nKaren prepares to transport Jack back to Glades, joined by another detainee, Hejira Henry, who mentions having already escaped from prison nine times. Having arranged for him to join Jack, Karen smiles as the van leaves for Florida.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[George Clooney]] as Jack Foley\n* [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Karen Sisco\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as Buddy Bragg\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as Maurice Miller\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as Glenn Michaels\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Richard Ripley\n* [[Dennis Farina]] as Marshall Sisco\n* [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]] as Chino\n* [[Isaiah Washington]] as Kenneth\n* [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] as Midge\n* [[Keith Loneker]] as White Boy Bob\n* [[Catherine Keener]] as Adele\n* [[Viola Davis]] as Moselle Miller\n* [[Paul Calder\u00f3n]] as Raymond Cruz\n* [[Wendell B.

Jackson]] as Hejira Henry (''uncredited'')\n* [[Connie Sawyer]] as Old Elevator Lady\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe source novel's origins lie in a picture Leonard saw in the ''[[Detroit News]]'' of a beautiful young female [[United States Marshals Service|federal marshal]] standing in front of a Miami courthouse with a shotgun resting on her hip. Producer [[Danny DeVito]] bought the rights to the book after his success with the [[Get Shorty (film)|1995 film adaptation]] of Leonard's novel ''[[Get Shorty]]''. Steven Soderbergh had made two films for [[Universal Pictures]] when executive [[Casey Silver]] offered him ''Out of Sight'' with George Clooney attached. However, the filmmaker was close to making another project and hesitated to commit. Silver told him, \"These things aren't going to line up very often, you should pay attention.\"<ref name= \"Jones, Belinda\">{{cite news | last = Jones | first = Belinda | title = Rockumentaries... | work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = January 1999 }}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[Sandra Bullock]] was originally considered to play Karen Sisco opposite Clooney. According to Soderbergh, \"What happened was I spent some time with [Clooney and Bullock] and they actually did have a great chemistry. But it was for the wrong movie. They really should do a movie together, but it was not Elmore Leonard energy.\"<ref name= \"Showbiz\">{{cite news | title = Steven Soderbergh Interview | work =  Mr. Showbiz | year = 1998 }}</ref>\n\nThe character of Foley appealed to Clooney, who as a boy had considered as heroes the bank robbers in movies, citing \"the [[James Cagney|Cagneys]] and the [[Humphrey Bogart|Bogarts]], [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]] and all those guys, the guys who were kind of bad and you still rooted for them. And when I read this, I thought, 'This guy is robbing a bank but you really want him to get away with it.'\"<ref name= \"Decha, Max\">{{cite news | last = Decha | first = Max | title = America's Most Wanted | work = [[Neon (magazine)|Neon]] | pages = 52 | date = December 1998 }}</ref>\n\nSoderbergh cites [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s 1973 film ''[[Don't Look Now]]'' as the primary influence on how he approached the love scene between Foley and Sisco: \"What I wanted to create in our movie was the intimacy of that, the juxtaposition of these two contrasting things ... We had to mix it up and have you feel like you were more in their heads.\"<ref name= \"Showbiz\"/>\n\n[[Danny DeVito]] and [[Garry Shandling]] were considered for the part of Ripley before [[Albert Brooks]] was cast.\n\nThe character Ray Nicolette also appears in Leonard's novel ''[[Rum Punch]]'', which was being filmed as ''[[Jackie Brown (film)|Jackie Brown]]'' when Universal Pictures was preparing to begin production on ''Out of Sight''. After [[Michael Keaton]] was cast as the detective Nicolette in ''Jackie Brown'', Universal subsequently cast him for a cameo in the same role in ''Out of Sight''. While [[Miramax Films]] owned the rights to the character, due to the fact that ''Jackie Brown'' went into production first, director [[Quentin Tarantino]] felt it was imperative that Miramax not charge Universal for using the character, allowing the character's appearance without Miramax receiving financial compensation. Nicolette appears in only one brief scene, whereas the character was a much more substantial element of ''Jackie Brown''.\n\n===Music===\n[[Disc jockey|DJ]] [[David Holmes (musician)|David Holmes]] was originally hired to write a few sections of the film's theme music. Soderbergh liked what he did so much that he had Holmes score the rest of the film. Holmes spent six weeks working 12- to 17-hour days to finish the score in time for the film's release. He drew upon several influences, including [[Lalo Schifrin]], [[Quincy Jones]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Sun Ra]], and [[Willie Bobo]].<ref name= \"Bautz\">{{cite news | last = Bautz | first = Mark | title = ''Sight'' and Sound | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = June 25, 1998 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,83568,00.html | access-date = 2009-05-23 }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Out of Sight'' was released on June 26, 1998, in 2,106 theaters and grossed [[USD]] 12 million on its opening weekend.
