The film also served as the first stop-motion feature film released by Sony Pictures Entertainment. The film received generally positive reviews,<ref name=RT /> and was a modest box office success, earning $123 million against a budget as high as $55 million.<ref name=\"BOM\"/><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3601&p=.htm | title=2012 Recap (cont.): Losers | publisher=Box Office Mojo | access-date=4 January 2013}}</ref> The film was nominated for the 2013 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]], but lost to [[Pixar]]'s ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]''. It was the second film from [[Sony Pictures Animation]] to be nominated after ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[London]], in 1837, [[Queen Victoria]] is told by her servants that [[British Empire|England]] rules the entire ocean, with the exception of pirates, whom she despises. Meanwhile, The Pirate Captain leads an unorthodox group of amateur pirates who are trying to make a name for themselves on the high seas. To prove his worth, The Captain enters the annual Pirate of the Year competition, with the winner being whoever can plunder the most treasure. After several failed attempts to plunder mundane ships, they come across the ''[[HMS Beagle]]'' and capture its lone passenger, [[Charles Darwin]], who recognizes the crew's pet \"parrot\", Polly, as the [[Endling|last living]] [[dodo|dodo bird]]. Darwin recommends that they enter Polly in the Scientist of the Year competition at the [[Royal Society of London]], and The Captain accepts, believing that winning the competition can help him win the Pirate of the Year award, despite his assistant, The Pirate with the scarf, advising him not to. Allowing The Pirate Captain and his crew to stay at his house for the night, Darwin plans to steal Polly for himself in order to impress Queen Victoria, whom he's smitten with. He has his trained chimpanzee Mr. Bobo steal Polly in a mysterious disguise, but the pirates give chase, which leads to Darwin's house being destroyed.\n\nThe next day, the pirates disguise themselves as scientists to enter the competition, and the dodo display wins the top prize, which turns out to be a meeting with the Queen. The Queen requests that Polly be put in her petting zoo, but The Captain refuses and accidentally reveals his true identity. The Queen orders to have him executed, but Darwin intervenes, reminding the Queen that Polly has been hidden and only the Captain knows where. The Queen [[pardon|pardons]] the Captain of his crimes and orders Darwin to find Polly by any means necessary. Darwin and Mr. Bobo take the Captain to a tavern, get him intoxicated, and steal Polly, but The Captain chases them into the [[Tower of London]], where the Queen is waiting. She gets rid of Darwin and Mr. Bobo for their incompetence via a trapdoor which leads to a dumpster, and offers The Captain enough treasure to ensure his win as Pirate of the Year in exchange for Polly. He accepts the offer and returns to his crew, telling them that he stole the treasure and assuring them Polly is still safe. \n\nAt the Pirate of the Year ceremony, the Captain is announced as the winner, but rival pirate Black Bellamy finds a newspaper revealing the Queen's pardon and explains that if pardoned, one is no longer a pirate, and cannot be Pirate of the Year. The Captain is stripped of his treasure and pirate attire, and admits to his crew that he sold Polly to the Queen for the treasure, prompting them to abandon him. The Captain returns to London to make a living selling baby clothes, and reunites with Darwin, who, while in the dumpster, found a brochure advertising a dining society of world leaders that feast on [[Endangered]] creatures, and Polly is to be served at their next banquet. Realizing the Queen's true intentions, The Pirate Captain and Darwin work together to steal an airship and find the Queen's flagship, the ''QV1'', while Mr. Bobo sets out to find the rest of The Captain's crew.\n\nAboard the ''QV1'', The Captain and Darwin find Polly before she's cooked and eaten, but the Queen finds them and attempts to kill both of them. Mr. Bobo and the crew come to their aid, but while fighting the Queen, they accidentally mix the ship's stash of [[baking soda]] with [[vinegar]], causing a violent reaction that explodes and breaks the ship in two. The Captain, along with the rest of his crew, escape safely, leaving the furious Queen behind on her deflating airship. The Captain becomes the highest bounty known to pirates, with 100,000 Doubloons placed on his head by the Queen, restoring his pirate reputation as well as marking him as the most dangerous pirate alive. Darwin stays on an island to study more exotic animals, Queen Victoria lands on the same island, and is (presumably) eaten by the animals who escaped from the QV1, and The Pirate Captain's crew, along with Mr. Bobo, continue to explore the high seas.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:The Pirates Band of Misfits, Hugh Grant, Sydney.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hugh Grant]] in April 2012 at the film's premiere in Sydney, Australia]]\n{{cast list|\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as the Pirate Captain<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2010/12/features/aardman-morphs|title=How Aardman is embracing the digital age|publisher=[[Wired Magazine]]|author=James Silver|magazine=Wired UK}}</ref>\n* [[Martin Freeman]] as the Pirate with a Scarf/Number Two<ref name=\"Hitfix1\">{{cite news | last=McWeeny | first=Drew | url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/motion-captured/posts/comic-con-sony-animation-panel | title=Comic-Con: Sony Animation panel puts Aardman's 'Pirates' front and center | publisher=[[HitFix]] | date=22 July 2011 | access-date=22 July 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Imelda Staunton]] as [[Queen Victoria]]<ref name=\"empire\" />\n* [[David Tennant]] as [[Charles Darwin]]\n* [[Jeremy Piven]] as Black Bellamy\n* [[Salma Hayek]] as Cutlass Liz<ref name=\"thr\">{{cite web |url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hugh-grant-joins-voice-cast-185746 |title=Hugh Grant Joins Voice Cast for Sony-Backed Pirate Movie|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=5 May 2011 |access-date=5 May 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Lenny Henry]] as Peg-Leg Hastings<ref>{{cite news|last=Lord|first=Peter|title=@PeteLordAardman|url=https://www.twitter.com/PeteLordAardman/statuses/136937271982170112|access-date=17 November 2011|newspaper=Twitter|date=16 November 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Brian Blessed]] as Pirate King<ref name=\"empire\" />\n* [[Russell Tovey]] as Albino Pirate ''(United Kingdom)''<ref>{{cite web | last=Mclean | first=Craig | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/more-mr-nice-guy-why-everyone-loves-russell-tovey-2067802.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220618/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/more-mr-nice-guy-why-everyone-loves-russell-tovey-2067802.html |archive-date=18 June 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live | title=More Mr Nice Guy: Why everyone loves Russell Tovey | work=[[The Independent]] | date=5 September 2010 | access-date=4 May 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Anton Yelchin]] as Albino Pirate ''(United States)''<ref>{{cite news|last=Berkshire|first=Geoff|title=Review: 'The Pirates!

One of them is that the British audience is more tolerant for the eccentricity of the British animators. Another is that the film makers did not want to challenge the United States viewers who do not accept the theory of evolution. He quoted science writer [[Jennifer Ouellette]]'s 2010 statement at the [[Science & Entertainment Exchange]] that scientists are undesirable in American popular culture, being represented as \"the mad scientist or the dweeby nerd that dress funny, have no social skills, play video games, long for unattainable women\".<ref name=BBCScientistsBand /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sarewitz |first1=Daniel |title=World view: Entertaining science |journal=Nature |date=1 July 2010 |volume=466 |issue=7302 |pages=27\u201327 |doi=10.1038/466027a |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/466027a |issn=1476-4687}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\nIn January 2012, it was reported that the latest trailer of ''The Pirates!'' attracted some very negative reactions from the \"leprosy community\".
