It stars [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] as a wandering criminal named Michel, and [[Jean Seberg]] as his American girlfriend Patricia. The film was Godard's first feature-length work and represented Belmondo's breakthrough as an actor.\n\n''Breathless'' is an influential example of [[French New Wave]] (''nouvelle vague'') cinema.<ref>{{cite book | title=Film: Video and DVD Guide 2007 | publisher=Halliwell's | year=2007 | location=London | page=1 | isbn= 978-0-00-723470-7}}</ref> Along with [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' and [[Alain Resnais]]'s ''[[Hiroshima mon amour]]'', both released a year earlier, it brought international attention to new styles of French filmmaking. At the time, ''Breathless'' attracted much attention for its bold visual style, which included then unconventional use of [[jump cut]]s.\n\nUpon its initial release in France, the film attracted over two million viewers. It has since been considered [[List of films considered the best|one of the best films ever made]], appearing in ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' magazine's decennial polls of filmmakers and critics on the subject on multiple occasions. In May 2010, a fully restored version of the film was released in the United States to coincide with the film's 50th anniversary.\n\n==Plot==\nMichel is a youthful, dangerous criminal who models himself on the film persona of [[Humphrey Bogart]]. After stealing a car in Marseille, Michel shoots and kills a policeman who has followed him onto a country road. Penniless and on the run from the police, he turns to an American love interest, Patricia, a student and aspiring journalist, who sells the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' on the boulevards of Paris. The ambivalent Patricia unwittingly hides him in her apartment as he simultaneously tries to seduce her and call in a loan to fund their escape to Italy. Patricia says she is pregnant, probably with Michel's child. She learns that Michel is on the run when questioned by the police. Eventually she betrays him, but before the police arrive, she tells Michel what she has done. He is somewhat resigned to a life in prison, and does not try to escape at first. The police shoot him in the street, and after running along the block, he dies \"\u00e0 bout de souffle\" (\"out of breath\").\n\n===Closing dialogue===\nThe film's final lines of dialogue cause some confusion for English-speaking audiences. The original French is ambiguous; it is unclear whether Michel is condemning Patricia or condemning the world in general; it is unclear if the Police Inspector Vital is intentionally twisting Michel's meaning. It is also unclear whether Patricia is questioning Michel's scorn, questioning the meaning of a French word as elsewhere in the film, or unable to understand the concept of what Michel is saying as it is translated to her by Vital when the two catch up with the dying Michel. \n<blockquote><poem>\nMICHEL: ''C'est vraiment d\u00e9gueulasse.''\nPATRICIA: ''Qu'est-ce qu'il a dit?''\nVITAL: ''Il a dit que vous \u00eates vraiment \"une d\u00e9gueulasse\".''\nPATRICIA: ''Qu'est-ce que c'est \"d\u00e9gueulasse\"?''<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VCoh5Yn9uaEC | author=Dudley Andrew| title=Breathless, chapter: Continuity script for the film| publisher= Rutgers University Press| series=Rutgers Films in Print series| year= 1987| isbn=978-0-8135-1253-2| page= 146}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053472/faq?ref_=tt_faq_1#.2.1.4|title=Breathless (1960) - FAQ|publisher=IMDb|access-date=10 March 2016}}</ref>\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nThis translates as:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nMICHEL: It's really disgusting.\nPATRICIA: What did he say?\nVITAL: He said you are really disgusting.\nPATRICIA: What is \"disgusting\"?\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn French, \"d\u00e9gueulasse\" also has the connotation of \"nauseating\", or making one want to throw up; in reference to a person, it can be loosely translated as a \"disgusting person\", i.e. a \"louse\" or \"scumbag\".\n\nIn the English captioning of the 2001 Fox-Lorber Region One DVD, \"''d\u00e9gueulasse''{{-\"}} is translated as \"scumbag\", producing the following dialogue:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nMICHEL: It's disgusting, really.\nPATRICIA: What did he say?\nVITAL: He said \"You're a real scumbag\".\nPATRICIA: What's a scumbag?\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nThe 2007 [[Criterion Collection]] Region One DVD uses a less literal translation:\n\n<blockquote><poem>MICHEL: Makes me want to puke.\nPATRICIA: What did he say?\nVITAL: He said you make him want to puke.\nPATRICIA: What's that mean, \"puke\"?</poem></blockquote>\n\nThis translation was used in the 2010 restoration.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Breathless-Screenshot-01.jpg|thumb|Jean Seberg and Jean-Paul Belmondo in ''Breathless'']]\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] as Michel Poiccard/Laszlo Kovacs\n* [[Jean Seberg]] as Patricia Franchini\n* [[Daniel Boulanger]] as Police Inspector Vital\n* Henri-Jacques Huet as Antonio Berruti\n* [[Roger Hanin]] as Carl Zumbach\n* Van Doude as Van Doude\n* Liliane Dreyfus as Liliane\n* [[Jean-Pierre Melville]] as Parvulesco\n* [[Jean-Luc Godard]] as an informer\n* Richard Balducci as Tolmachoff\n* [[Philippe de Broca]] as an extra\n* [[Jean Douchet]] as an extra\n* [[Jean Herman]] as an extra\n* [[Andre S.

On this reading, Michel and Patricia are attracted to each other because both live life as essentially meaningless. As an active nihilist, Michel responds to this condition with \"cheerfulness, intensity, and style\" (modelled on Bogart, whose humorous gestures he adopts), throwing himself fully into momentary engagements, including reckless crime and his love for Patricia. Patricia, as a passive nihilist, however, rejects all engagements, dissatisfied with and afraid of the very meaninglessness that Michel enjoys. In the end, she turns him in to the police so that he will be forced to leave and the love affair will end; but he instead throws himself into death with undiminished gusto. Her puzzled reaction to his final performance leaves its impact on her attitude open.<ref name=\"Dreyfus\">{{Cite web\n| title = Professor Dreyfus lecture - Breathless (\u00c0 bout de souffle) Active & Passive Nihilism\n| author = \n| work = YouTube\n| date = 17 June 2012\n| access-date = 26 March 2021\n| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th52fhMlsDA\n| quote = \n}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Background and writing===\n''Breathless'' was based loosely on a newspaper article that [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] read in ''The News in Brief''. The character of Michel Poiccard is based on real-life Michel Portail and his American girlfriend and journalist Beverly Lynette. In November 1952, Portail stole a car to visit his sick mother in Le Havre and ended up killing a motorcycle cop named Grimberg.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite AV media |title={{Ill|Chambre 12, H\u00f4tel de Su\u00e8de|fr}} |last1=Ventura |first1=Claude |last2=Villetard |first2=Xavier |date=2016 |medium=DVD |publisher=The Criterion Collection |oclc=960384313 |language=fr}} 1993 French television documentary (78 minutes).

Godard had read and liked the treatment and wanted to make the film. While working as a press agent at [[20th Century Fox]], Godard met producer [[Georges de Beauregard]] and told him that his latest film was not any good. De Beauregard hired Godard to work on the script for ''[[P\u00eacheur d'Islande]]''. After six weeks, Godard became bored with the script and instead suggested making ''Breathless''. Chabrol and Truffaut agreed to give Godard their treatment and wrote de Beauregard a letter from the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in May 1959 agreeing to work on the film if Godard directed it. Truffaut and Chabrol had recently become star directors, and their names secured financing for the film. Truffaut was credited as the original writer and Chabrol as the technical adviser. Chabrol later claimed that he only visited the set twice and Truffaut's biggest contribution was persuading Godard to cast Liliane David in a minor role.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Fellow New Wave director [[Jacques Rivette]] appears in a cameo as the dead body of a man hit by a car in the street.<ref>{{cite book |last=Brody |first=Richard |title=Everything is Cinema: The Working Life of Jean-Luc Godard |publisher=Metropolitan Books |location=New York, New York |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-8050-8015-5 |page=74}}</ref>\n\nGodard wrote the script as he went along. He told Truffaut \"Roughly speaking, the subject will be the story of a boy who thinks of death and of a girl who doesn't.\"<ref name=\"Fotiade2013\">{{cite book|author=Fotiade, Ramona|title=A Bout de Souffle: French Film Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z14BAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA35|access-date=17 November 2017|date=28 May 2013|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85772-117-4|pages=29\u201330}}</ref> As well as the real-life Michel Portail, Godard based the main character on screenwriter [[Paul G\u00e9gauff]], who was known as a swaggering seducer of women. Godard also named several characters after people he had known earlier in his life when he lived in Geneva.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The film includes a couple of in-jokes as well: the young woman selling ''[[Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma]]'' on the street (Godard had written for the magazine), and Michel's occasional alias of Laszlo Kovacs, the name of Belmondo's character in Chabrol's 1959 film ''[[Web of Passion]]''.\n\nTruffaut believed Godard's change to the ending was a personal one. \"In my script, the film ends with the boy walking along the street as more and more people turn and stare after him, because his photo's on the front of all the newspapers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Francois Truffaut on 'Breathless'|url=https://filmhistorytwo.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/breathless_pressbook.pdf|work=Breathless 50th Anniversary Restoration|publisher=Rialto Pictures Pressbook|access-date=17 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118222326/https://filmhistorytwo.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/breathless_pressbook.pdf|archive-date=18 November 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>...Jean-Luc chose a violent end because he was by nature sadder than I.... he had need of [his] particular ending.

In order to broaden the film's commercial appeal, Godard sought a prominent leading lady who would be willing to work in his low-budget film. He came to [[Jean Seberg]] through her then-husband Francois Moreuil, with whom he had been acquainted.<ref name=\"filmthreat.com\">[http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=interviews&Id=1181 \"The Jean Seberg Enigma: Interview with Garry McGee\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125152903/http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=interviews&Id=1181 |date=25 January 2009 }}, Film Threat, 28 March. 2008</ref> Seberg agreed to appear in the film on 8 June 1959 for $15,000, which was one-sixth of the film's budget. Godard ended up giving Seberg's husband a small part in the film.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> During the production, Seberg privately questioned Godard's style and wondered if the film would be commercially viable. After the film's success, she collaborated with Godard again on the short ''Le Grand Escroc'', which revived her ''Breathless'' character.<ref name=\"filmthreat.com\"/>\n\nGodard initially wanted cinematographer [[Michel Latouche]] to shoot the film after having worked with him on his first short films. De Beauregard instead hired [[Raoul Coutard]], who was under contract to him.<ref name=\"Criterion. Coutard and Rissient\">Criterion. Coutard and Rissient.</ref>\n\nThe 1958 ethno-fiction ''[[Moi, un noir]]'' has been credited as a key influence for Godard. This can be seen in the adoption of jump-cuts, use of real locations rather than constructed sets and the documentary, newsreel format of filming.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/3Iz3JTGHRh0 Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160518202131/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Iz3JTGHRh0 Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{Citation|last=CinemaTyler|title=What I Learned From Watching: Breathless (1960) [INTERACTIVE VIDEO]|date=2015-02-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Iz3JTGHRh0|access-date=2019-07-02}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cip-idf.org/article.php3?id_article=2140|title=CIP-IDF > Projections du 4 juin|website=www.cip-idf.org|access-date=2019-07-02}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nGodard envisaged ''Breathless'' as a ''reportage'' (documentary), and tasked cinematographer [[Raoul Coutard]] to shoot the entire film on a [[hand-held camera]], with next to no lighting.<ref name=\"Begery, Benjamin p. 200\">Begery, Benjamin.

No permission was received to shoot the film in its various locations (mainly the side streets and boulevards of Paris), adding to the spontaneous feel for which Godard was aiming.<ref>{{cite news| last=Solomons| first=Jason| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/06/raoul-coutard-jean-luc-godard-breathless| title= Jean-Luc Godard would just turn up scribble some dialogue, and we would rehearse maybe a few times| newspaper= [[The Observer]]| date= 6 June 2010}}</ref> However, all locations were selected before shooting began, and assistant director Pierre Rissient has described the shoot as very organized. Actor Richard Balducci has stated that shooting days ranged from 15 minutes to 12 hours, depending on how many ideas Godard had on a given day. Producer Georges de Beauregard wrote a letter to the entire crew complaining about the erratic shooting schedule. Coutard said that when de Beauregard encountered Godard at a caf\u00e9 on a day on which Godard had called in sick, the two engaged in a fistfight.<ref name=\"Criterion. Coutard and Rissient\"/>\n\nGodard shot most of the film chronologically, with the exception of the first sequence, which was filmed toward the end of the shoot.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Filming at the H\u00f4tel de Su\u00e8de for the lengthy bedroom scene with Michel and Patricia included a minimal crew and no lights. The location was difficult to secure, but Godard was determined to shoot there after having lived at the hotel after returning from South America in the early 1950s. Instead of renting a [[Camera dolly|dolly]] with complicated and time-consuming tracks to lay, Godard and Coutard rented a wheelchair that Godard often pushed himself.<ref name=\"Criterion. Coutard and Rissient\"/> For certain street scenes, Coutard hid in a postal cart with a hole for the lens and packages piled on top of him.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Shooting lasted for 23 days and ended on 12 September 1959. The final scene in which Michel is shot in the street was filmed on the rue Campagne-Premi\u00e8re in Paris.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWriting for ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'' magazine in 1960, [[Pierre Marcabru]] observed: \"It seems that, if we had footage of Godard shooting his film, we would discover a sort of accord between the dramatized world in front of the camera (Belmondo and Seberg playing a scene) and the working world behind it (Godard and Raoul Coutard shooting the scene), as if the wall between the real and projected worlds had been torn down.\"{{Citation needed|reason=Direction quotations need a citation.|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Editing===\n''Breathless'' was processed and edited at GTC Labs in [[Joinville-le-Pont|Joinville]] by lead editor C\u00e9cile Decugis and assistant editor Lila Herman. Decugis has said that the film had a bad reputation before its premiere as the worst film of the year.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nCoutard said that \"there was a panache in the way it was edited that didn't match at all the way it was shot. The editing gave it a very different tone than the films we were used to seeing.\"<ref name=\"Criterion. Coutard and Rissient\"/> The film's use of [[jump cut]]s has been called innovative. [[Andrew Sarris]] analyzed it as existentially representing \"the meaninglessness of the time interval between moral decisions.\"<ref>The Criterion Collection. ''Breathless'' DVD. Special Features, disc 2. Breathless as Criticism. 2007.</ref> Assistant director Pierre Rissient said that the jump cut style was not intended during the film's shooting or the initial stages of editing.<ref name=\"Criterion. Coutard and Rissient\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nIn his 2008 biography of Godard, [[Richard Brody]] wrote: \"The seminal importance of the film was recognized immediately. In January 1960 \u2013 prior to the film's release \u2013 Godard won the Jean Vigo Prize, awarded 'to encourage an auteur of the future' ... ''Breathless'' opened in Paris ... not in an art house but at a chain of four commercial theaters, selling 259,046 tickets in four weeks. The eventual profit was substantial, rumored to be fifty times the investment. The film's success with the public corresponded to its generally ardent and astonished critical reception ... ''Breathless,'' as a result of its extraordinary and calculated congruence with the moment, and of the fusion of its attributes with the story of its production and with the public persona of its director, was singularly identified with the media responses it generated.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Brody |first=Richard |title=Everything is Cinema: The Working Life of Jean-Luc Godard |publisher=Henry Holt & Co. |date=2008 |page=72}}</ref>\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[A.

Other Godard works are also scattered through the scene. Dialog from this film is recited by two other characters throughout the episode. Themes from this episode parallel themes from both this movie and Godard's complete oeuvre. The climax of the episode hinges on the final lines, including one additional line, from the final scene of the film.\n* In an episode of ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'', Sergeant Jeffords mentions ''Breathless'' when the detectives are discussing their favorite cop movies. Jeffords identifies the film as \"Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's ''Breathless''\", despite the fact that only the director's name is generally used in such a way. In reference to this error, Jeffords is seen later in the season at a party, defending his statement by saying \"film is a writer's medium\".\n* In ''[[The Dreamers (2003 film)|The Dreamers]]'' one of the protagonists re-enacts a scene from the film.\n* The final scene is recreated in Romeo Void's \"Never Say Never\" video.\n* In issue #30 of [[IDW Publishing|IDW]]'s ongoing comic book series ''[[The Transformers (IDW Publishing)|Transformers: More Than Meets the Eye]]'', Whirl votes for repeat showings of the film during the crew's movie night.\n* The Canadian band [[The Tragically Hip]] made a music video for the song \"In View\" that pays homage to the film.\n* In the 2001 Novel [[Jean-Michel Guenassia#Works|''The Incorrigible Optimists Club'']] by [[Jean-Michel Guenassia]], the main character sees the film in the cinema with his family. The theater is empty and the woman working the ticket stand advises against seeing it. Nonetheless, he loves the film.\n* The 2017 [[Malayalam]]-language film ''[[Mayaanadhi]]'' (''Mystic River''), directed by Ashiq Abu, draws inspiration from ''Breathless''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibtimes.co.in/mayaanadhi-copy-godards-french-classic-breathless-here-truth-behind-social-media-campaign-755169/|title=Is Mayaanadhi a copy of Godard's French classic Breathless?|website=[[International Business Times]] |date=January 2018|access-date=12 March 2020}}</ref>\n* The 1967 film [[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|''Bonnie and Clyde'']] contains numerous visual references to ''Breathless'', including an early shot of Warren Beatty wearing a fedora slanted over his eyes and with a match tilted upward held in his lips, echoing Jean-Paul Belmondo's hat and cigarette in the opening scenes of ''Breathless''. Later Beatty also wears a pair of round-rim black sunglasses with one lens missing, an exact visual reference to Belmondo wearing the same sunglasses with a missing lens later in ''Breathless''. ''Bonnie and Clyde'' also shares a general storyline with ''Breathless'', involving a handsome, nihilistic young killer who steals cars and who connects with a beautiful, free-spirited young woman. [[Pauline Kael]], in her 1967 review of ''Bonnie and Clyde'' in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', wrote that \"If this way of holding more than one attitude toward life is already familiar to us\u2014if we recognize the make-believe robbers whose toy guns produce real blood, and the Keystone cops who shoot them dead, from Truffaut\u2019s ''Shoot the Piano Player'' and Godard\u2019s gangster pictures, ''Breathless'' and Band of Outsiders\u2014it\u2019s because the young French directors discovered the poetry of crime in American life (from our movies) and showed the Americans how to put it on the screen in a new, 'existential' way.\"\n* [[Daryush Shokof]] makes the all-female film ''Breathful'' with reference to ''Breathless''.\n* In ''[[A Very Secret Service]]'', the characters go to see ''Breathless'' in a movie theater, and are shown watching the iconic final scene.\n* In ''[[The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo ]]'', fictional actress Evelyn Hugo, at a low point in her career, watches ''Breathless'' and is inspired to go to Paris to revive her career.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Breathless (1983 film)|Breathless]]'', a 1983 American remake starring [[Richard Gere]] in the Belmondo role and [[Val\u00e9rie Kaprisky]] in the Seberg role\n* [[List of French-language films]]\n* [[List of films considered the best]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0053472|Breathless}}\n* {{Amg title|7054|Breathless}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=69637}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|breathless|Breathless}}\n* [http://thoughtcatalog.com/2010/breathless-jean-luc-godard-movie/ Why ''Breathless'' (Essay on ThoughtCatalog.com)]\n* [http://www.newwavefilm.com/french-new-wave-encyclopedia/breathless.shtml ''Breathless'' on NewWaveFilm.com]\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/526-breathless-then-and-now ''Breathless Then and Now''] an essay by [[Dudley Andrew]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Jean-Luc Godard}}\n{{French New Wave}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Breathless (1960 Film)}}\n[[Category:1960 films]]\n[[Category:1960 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:1960 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jean-Luc Godard]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:French black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:French crime drama films]]\n[[Category:1960s French-language films]]\n[[Category:1960s multilingual films]]\n[[Category:French multilingual films]]\n[[Category:1960s French films]]"}]}}}}
