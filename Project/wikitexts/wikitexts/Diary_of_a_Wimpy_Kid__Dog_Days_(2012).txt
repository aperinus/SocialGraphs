It stars [[Zachary Gordon]] and [[Steve Zahn]]. [[Robert Capron]], [[Devon Bostick]], [[Rachael Harris]], [[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton List]], [[Grayson Russell]], and [[Karan Brar]] also have prominent roles. It is the third installment in the ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]'' film series. It was released by 20th Century Fox on August 3, and it earned $77.1 million against a $22 million production budget.\n\nThe film is based on the third and fourth books of the [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid|Diary of a Wimpy Kid book series]], ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw|The Last Straw]]'' and ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days (book)|Dog Days]]'', respectively. The \"Holly Hills\"  and \"Spag Union\" portions of the film are featured in the third book, while much of the rest is based on the fourth book.\n\nThe film is also the last one in the series to feature the original cast members, as many of the cast (such as [[Zachary Gordon]], [[Robert Capron]] and [[Devon Bostick]]) outgrew their roles and new actors were cast for the next installment ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'', which was released on May 19, 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Should be 400-700 per WP:FILMPLOT--> \nAfter Greg and Rodrick develop a brotherly bond, their family visits the local pool, where they run into Lenwood Heath, a reformed delinquent friend of Rodrick's who works as a lifeguard. Heath attends Spag Union, a military school that begins at the eighth grade. Frank notes that Greg is about to enter eighth grade and considers signing him up.\n\nAfter learning that Greg spent his entire first day of summer vacation playing video games, Frank disables the family's television set. Susan starts a book club for Greg and his friends and urges Frank to spend more time with him. Frank takes him fishing and to a [[American Civil War reenactment|Civil War reenactment]], but his incompetence annoys Frank.\n\nRowley invites Greg to the local country club. Initially reluctant, he joins Rowley as a guest after learning that his crush, Holly Hills, teaches tennis there. Frank surprises Greg with an unpaid summer internship at his office, hoping they can bond. Disliking the idea, Greg lies about getting a job at the country club, to Frank and Susan's delight. Frank and Susan give Greg a starter cell phone that only allows him to call home or 911.\n\nRowley invites Greg on a family trip to a rented beach house near the boardwalk, and they ride a ride called the Cranium Shaker that Rodrick suggested, despite Rowley's parents forbidding them from going on \"scary rides\". Greg becomes increasingly uneasy with the Jeffersons' eccentric lifestyle and secretly uses Rowley's father Robert's laptop computer to email Susan to get himself out of the trip. The Jeffersons confront him after he accidentally sends the email to everyone on Robert's contact list. He desperately tries to call home using his phone but inadvertently calls 911, leading to Robert almost getting arrested for coming to the door with a knife in his hand. Greg is sent home early, and Frank starts to believe that Rowley is a bad influence.\n\nA few days later, Rowley informs Greg that he is no longer allowed to invite him to the country club, but he sneaks in by impersonating members. After Rodrick learns that Holly's sister, Heather, whom he has a crush on, also works at the club, he asks Greg to help him sneak in. Greg reconciles with Rowley and gets L\u00f6ded Diper a gig for Heather's upcoming [[Sweet sixteen (birthday)|sweet sixteen]], to Rodrick's delight. During another country club visit, Robert confronts Frank and Greg over Greg's purchase of two hundred and sixty dollars worth of smoothies. Frank mentions that Greg has a \"job\" there, but the manager denies this. Learning the truth of Greg's deception, Frank expresses his disappointment with him. Shortly after, Rodrick reveals to him that a Spag Union disc has been mailed to them, to his horror.\n\nRodrick urges Greg to go on the \"Wilderness Weekend\" camping trip with his classmates to impress Frank. During it, Fregley tells a scary story. Spooked, Greg strikes Frank's hand with a mallet. Greg admits his guilt over constantly messing up. The next day, after overhearing Frank's boss, Stan Warren, insult him over his lack of camping skills, Greg sets a trap with his friends and sneaks into Stan's tent, where he learns that their troop has been cheating by using household appliances and eating precooked meals. Stan discovers Greg and insults him, but Frank chastises Stan for faking his camping skills. He runs into Greg's trap, humiliating himself. At a motel, Frank confesses he never liked camping and decides not to send Greg to Spag Union, to his surprise and delight. He also talks to him about learning from mistakes and taking responsibility, making them both realize they are more alike than they thought.\n\nAt Heather's party a few days later, L\u00f6ded Diper performs a [[hard rock]] cover of \"[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)|Baby]]\" with Rodrick on lead vocals to try to impress her. The performance goes awry when he accidentally knocks over a huge [[ice sculpture|ice bust]] of her. She attempts to assault him with a microphone stand but smashes a [[chocolate fountain]] with it, ending the party in disaster. Holly and Greg still become a couple and spend the rest of their summer together with Rowley.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Zachary Gordon]] as [[Greg Heffley]], the main character.\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as Frank Heffley, Greg's father.\n* [[Robert Capron]] as Rowley Jefferson, Greg's best friend.\n* [[Devon Bostick]] as Rodrick Heffley, Greg's older brother.\n* [[Rachael Harris]] as Susan Heffley, Greg's mother.\n* [[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton List]] as Holly Hills, Greg's crush and eventual girlfriend.\n* [[Grayson Russell]] as Fregley, a weird friend of Greg's.\n* [[Karan Brar]] as Chirag Gupta, one of Greg's friends.\n* Bryce Hodgson as Ben, one of Rodrick\u2019s friends.\n* [[Laine MacNeil]] as Patty Farrell, Greg's arch-enemy.\n* [[Melissa Roxburgh]] as Heather Hills, Holly's older sister and Rodrick's crush.
