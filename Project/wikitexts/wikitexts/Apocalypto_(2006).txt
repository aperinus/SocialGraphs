The film features a cast of Native American and Indigenous Mexican actors consisting of [[Rudy Youngblood]], [[Raoul Trujillo]], [[Mayra S\u00e9rbulo]], Dalia Hern\u00e1ndez, [[Gerardo Taracena]], Rodolfo Palacios, Bernardo Ruiz Juarez, Ammel Rodrigo Mendoza, Ricardo Diaz Mendoza, and [[Israel Contreras]]. All of the indigenous people depicted in the film were [[Maya peoples|Maya]]. Similar to Gibson's earlier film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', all dialogue is in a modern approximation of the ancient language of the setting. Here, the Indigenous [[Yucatec Mayan language]] is spoken with subtitles, which sometimes refer to the language as [[Mayan languages|Mayan]]. This was the last film Gibson directed until 2016's ''[[Hacksaw Ridge]]'' ten years later.\n\nSet in [[Yucat\u00e1n]], Mexico, around the year [[Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n|1502]], ''Apocalypto'' portrays the [[hero's journey]] of a young man named Jaguar Paw, a late [[Mesoamerica]]n hunter and his fellow tribesmen who are captured by an invading force. After the devastation of their village, they are brought on a perilous journey to a [[Mayan civilization|Mayan]] city for [[Human sacrifice in Mayan culture|human sacrifice]] at a time when the Mayan civilization is in decline. The film was a box office success, grossing over $120 million worldwide, and received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising Gibson's direction, [[Dean Semler]]'s cinematography, and the performances of the cast, though the portrayal of [[Mayan civilization]] and historical accuracy were criticized. The film was distributed by [[Buena Vista Pictures]] in North America and [[Icon Film Distribution]] in the United Kingdom and Australia.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile hunting in the [[Mesoamerican]] rainforest, Jaguar Paw, his father Flint Sky, and their fellow tribesmen encounter a contingent of fleeing refugees, and the group's leader explains that their lands were ravaged and asks for permission to pass through the jungle. Flint Sky notes that the refugees were sick with fear and urges Jaguar Paw to never allow fear to infect him. Later that night, the tribe gathers around an elder who tells a prophetic story about a being who is consumed by an emptiness that cannot be satisfied, despite having all the gifts of the world offered to him, and who will continue blindly taking until there is nothing left in the world for him to take, and the world is no more.\n\nThe next morning, the village is attacked by raiders led by Zero Wolf; huts are set on fire, many villagers are killed, and the surviving adults are taken prisoner. During the attack, Jaguar Paw lowers his pregnant wife Seven and their young son Turtles Run into a [[cenote]]. Returning to the fight, Jaguar Paw nearly kills the sadistic raider Middle Eye, but is eventually captured. When Middle Eye realizes that Flint Sky is Jaguar Paw's father, he kills Flint Sky and mockingly renames Jaguar Paw \"Almost\". The raiders tie the captives together and set out on a long forced march through the jungle, leaving the children behind to fend for themselves. The refugees from earlier are also shown to have been taken captive. Meanwhile, Seven and Turtles Run remain trapped in the well after a suspicious raider severs the vine leading out of it.\n\nAs the party approaches the raiders' [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n city, they encounter razed forests and vast fields of failed [[maize]] crops, alongside villages decimated by an unknown disease. They then pass a little girl infected with the plague who prophesies the end of the [[Maya civilization|Mayan world]]. Once the raiders and captives reach the city, the females are sold into slavery while the males are escorted to the top of a [[Mesoamerican pyramids#Maya|step pyramid]] to be [[human sacrifice|sacrificed]] before the Mayan king and queen.\n\nTwo captives are sacrificed, but as Jaguar Paw is laid out on the altar, a [[solar eclipse]] gives the [[Maya religion|high priest]] pause, and the Mayans take the event as an omen that the gods are satisfied and conclude the ceremony, sparing the remaining captives.\n\nThe remaining captives are then taken by the raiders to be used as target practice and offered freedom if they can run to safety. The first pair of captives to attempt the run across the arena are struck down. Jaguar Paw suffers an arrow wound, but escapes into the jungle, killing Zero Wolf's son Cut Rock in the process. Zero Wolf and Middle Eye take their men to chase after him. Fleeing back into the jungle, Jaguar Paw nearly sinks in quicksand, but very calmly escapes. Reflecting on this, he remembers his father's lesson about fear and resolves to kill his pursuers with the resources the jungle provides him. He dares the nine Raiders to challenge him, and they die one by one: killed by a [[jaguar]]; a snake; drowning and one killed by Zero Wolf himself. Jaguar Paw kills Zero Wolf. The last two Raiders pursue Jaguar Paw.\n\nLater, heavy rain begins to fall, threatening to drown Jaguar Paw's family, who are still trapped in the pit. Seven gives birth to another son, who is born under the surface of the dangerously rising water. Meanwhile, the two remaining raiders chase Jaguar Paw towards the coast, where all three are astonished at the sight of [[Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s making their way to the shore. As the two raiders are confounded by the Spanish ships, Jaguar Paw uses the distraction to flee and return to his village. Jaguar Paw returns just in time to save his family from the flooding pit, and is overjoyed at the sight of his newborn son.\n\nLater, the reunited family looks out over the water at the Spanish ships. Jaguar Paw decides not to approach the strangers, and they depart, returning into the jungle to seek a new beginning.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|'''The Village'''\n* [[Rudy Youngblood]] as Jaguar Paw/ Almost\n* [[Dalia Hern\u00e1ndez]] as Seven\n* Jonathan Brewer as Blunted\n* [[Morris Birdyellowhead]] as Flint Sky\n* Carlos Emilio B\u00e1ez as Turtles Run\n* Am\u00edlcar Ram\u00edrez as Curl Nose\n* [[Israel Contreras]] as Smoke Frog\n* Israel R\u00edos as Cocoa Leaf\n* Mar\u00eda Isabel D\u00edaz as Mother in Law\n* Espiridion Acosta Cache as Old Story Teller\n* [[Mayra Serbulo]] as Young Woman\n\n'''The Holcane Warriors'''\n* [[Raoul Trujillo]] as Zero Wolf\n* [[Gerardo Taracena]] as Middle Eye\n* Rodolfo Palacios as Snake Ink\n* Ariel Galv\u00e1n as Hanging Moss\n* Bernardo Ruiz Ju\u00e1rez as Drunkards Four\n* Ricardo D\u00edaz Mendoza as Cut Rock\n\n'''The City'''\n* Fernando Hern\u00e1ndez as High Priest\n* Mar\u00eda Isidra Hoil as Oracle Girl\n* Aquetzali Garc\u00eda as Oracle Girl\n* [[Abel Woolrich]] as Laughing Man\n* Rafael V\u00e9lez as King\n* Diana Botello as Queen\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Screenplay===\n[[File:Mel Gibson Cannes 2016 3.jpg|thumb|[[Mel Gibson]] directed ''Apocalypto'' after he made ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''.]]\n\nScreenwriter and co-producer [[Farhad Safinia]] first met [[Mel Gibson]] while working as an assistant during the post-production of ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''.

He also served as a dialogue coach during production. As they researched the script, Safinia and Gibson traveled to Guatemala, Costa Rica and the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] to scout filming locations and visit Maya ruins.\n\nStriving for a degree of historical accuracy, the filmmakers employed a consultant, [[Richard D.

As director of the [[Mirador Basin]] Project, he works to preserve a large swath of the Guatemalan rain forest and its Maya ruins.

The scarification and tattooing was all researched, the inlaid jade teeth are in there, the [[earspool|ear spools]] are in there.
