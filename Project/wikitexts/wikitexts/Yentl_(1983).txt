It is based on [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]]'s short story \"Yentl the Yeshiva Boy\".{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n\nThe film incorporates humor and music to tell the story of an [[Ashkenazi]] [[Judaism|Jewish]] girl in [[Poland]] who decides to dress and live like a boy so that she can receive an education in [[Talmudic law]] after her father dies. The film's [[Film score|musical score]] and songs, composed by [[Michel Legrand]], with lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman, include the songs \"[[Papa, Can You Hear Me?]]\" and \"[[The Way He Makes Me Feel]]\", both sung by Streisand. The film received the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Academy Award for Best Original Song Score]] and the [[Golden Globe Award]]s for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture\u2014Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Streisand, making her the first woman to have won Best Director at the Golden Globes.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n\n==Plot==\nYentl Mendel is a woman living in an Ashkenazi [[shtetl]] named Pechev<ref>{{cite journal|last=Whitfield|first=Stephen|title=Yentl|journal=Jewish Social Studies|date=January 1999|page=154}}</ref> in [[Vistula Land|Poland]] in 1904. Yentl's father, Rebbe Mendel ([[Nehemiah Persoff]]), secretly instructs her in the [[Talmud]] despite the proscription of such study by women according to the custom of her community. Yentl refuses to be married off to a man.\n\nAfter the death of her father, Yentl decides to cut her hair short, dress like a man, take her late brother's name, Anshel, and enter a [[Yeshiva]], a Jewish religious school in [[Bychawa]]. There she befriends a fellow student, Avigdor ([[Mandy Patinkin]]), and meets his fianc\u00e9e, Hadass ([[Amy Irving]]). Upon discovering that Avigdor lied about his brother's death (a suicide, not consumption as Avigdor claimed), Hadass' family cancels the wedding over fears that Avigdor's family is tainted with insanity. Hadass' parents decide that she should marry Anshel instead, and Avigdor encourages Anshel to go ahead with the marriage, so Hadass can marry someone she knows rather than have a stranger for a husband. Anshel marries Hadass\u2014to avoid Avigdor fleeing town\u2014but, their marriage remains [[sexless marriage|unconsummated]], Anshel claiming it is a sin for a woman to give herself to a man while she loves another. Anshel starts to teach Hadass the Talmud. Meanwhile, Hadass develops romantic feelings for Yentl (as Anshel), while Yentl herself is falling in love with Avigdor.\n\nAnshel leaves for a trip to the city with Avigdor that will take him away from home for a few days. In their lodging in the city, Anshel finally reveals his true identity to Avigdor. At first, Avigdor does not believe his friend is a woman, but Yentl proves her womanhood by showing him her breasts. When a confused Avigdor asks her why she didn't tell him, Yentl breaks down in his arms, showing she has revealed her real self to him out of love. Avigdor is stunned, but, after a moment, reciprocates the feeling  and remarks how beautiful Yentl's features are. The two kiss, but, Avigdor breaks away suddenly, remembering Hadass. Yentl assures him their marriage is not valid. Avigdor suggests he and Yentl elope. Yentl realizes that she will not be able to continue her studies if she marries Avigdor, and that she wants more from life than to be a wife. Yentl and Avigdor part ways, knowing they will always care for each other. It is implied that Hadass and Anshel's marriage is annulled, as it was never [[consummated]]. Avigdor returns to marry Hadass. In the following scene, the two are successfully reunited and reading a letter from Yentl, learning that she's going to a new place and will love them both always. Yentl leaves Europe on a boat bound for the United States, where she hopes to lead a life with more freedom. With a smile on her face, Yentl finishes her story by singing: \"Papa, watch me fly.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Barbra Streisand]] as Yentl Mendel\n* [[Mandy Patinkin]] as Avigdor\n* [[Amy Irving]] as Hadass Vishkower\n* [[Nehemiah Persoff]] as Rebbe Mendel\n* [[Steven Hill]] as Reb Alter Vishkower\n* [[Allan Corduner]] as Shimmele\n* [[David de Keyser]] as Rabbi Zalman\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Sarah\n* [[Doreen Mantle]] as Mrs. Shaemen\n* [[Lynda Baron]] as Peshe \n* [[Kerry Shale]] as Yeshiva Student\n\n==Production==\nThe production of Barbra Streisand's film ''Yentl'' was a long and arduous process that delayed the project for over a decade.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n\nAfter reading Isaac Bashevis Singer's story \"Yentl: The Yeshiva Boy\" in 1968, Streisand sought to make it her next film after her completion of ''[[Funny Girl (film)|Funny Girl]]''.<ref name=\"Considine 1985 298\"/> The screen rights were gained in 1969, with Streisand to be the star.<ref>{{cite book|last=Spada|first=James|title=Streisand: Her Life|year=1995|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|page=402}}</ref> In 1971, the Czechoslovakian director, [[Ivan Passer]], was originally hired by First Artists to direct the film.

For the sake of making memory of the occasion, Streisand had her brother take a photo of her standing next to her father's tombstone. The photo revealed that Emmanual Streisand's grave was directly next to that of a man named Anshel, the name of Yentl's dead brother that Yentl adopts when she takes on a male identity.

She was working with a script by Ted Allen at the time, but discarded a majority of it, keeping the musical segments. The film was to be co-produced by Barbra's friends and associates: Joan Marshall Ashby and Jon Peters. To prepare for the film, Streisand exhaustively researched the many aspects of Judaism, ceremonies, relentlessly studied the Torah, and consulted numerous rabbis,<ref name=\"Riese 1993 408\"/> one being Rabbi Lapin, whom Streisand appointed as the main religious consultant for the film.<ref>{{cite book|last=Riese|first=Randall|title=Her Name Is Barbra|url=https://archive.org/details/hernameisbarbrai00ries_0|url-access=registration|year=1993|publisher=Carol Publishing|location=Madison Ave. New York, NY|page=[https://archive.org/details/hernameisbarbrai00ries_0/page/410 410]|isbn=9781559722032 }}</ref>\n\nOrion Pictures made the announcement that it had agreed to produce ''Yentl'' as Barbra Streisand's directorial debut in the late summer of 1980. Traveling to Prague with a Super-8 camera and song lyrics, Streisand scouted out film locations while also shooting film of herself walking through the city in costume with early recordings of ''Yentl''{{'}}s soundtrack being played in the background.<ref>{{cite book|last=Andersen|first=Christopher|title=Barbra: The Way She Is|url=https://archive.org/details/barbrawaysheis00ande_234|url-access=limited|year=2006|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/barbrawaysheis00ande_234/page/n321 278]}}</ref> However, not long after her return, ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980), a [[Michael Cimino]] picture produced by United Artists, lost $35 million at the box office, bringing Orion to cancel all films that exceeded a $10 million production cost in order to preserve itself.

Streisand's character is a young woman growing up in an oppressive society that will not let her pursue her religious education. She is told she must have the \"soul of a man\" because of her desire to learn.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Whitfield|first=Stephen|title=Yentl|journal=Jewish Social Studies|date=Autumn 1998 \u2013 Winter 1999|volume=5|issue=1/2|page=154|doi=10.2979/jss.1998.5.1-2.154}}</ref> Her talent, curiosity and ambition are considered strictly masculine by her society and religious tradition. Unwilling to live without access to education on the basis of sex, Yentl leaves her home and conceals her sex to be able to pursue the scholarly occupation of a Jewish man. In doing so, Yentl inadvertently embarks on a journey of self-discovery that defies traditional ideas of gender roles within her community.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n\nYentl's defiance of social expectation and her reversal of traditional gender roles crosses deeply rooted religious boundaries, particularly once Yentl marries Hadass. Until this point, Yentl only adopts the appearance and occupation of a man, but now she lives as a man in a more complete sense, as a husband, occupying the traditionally male role in her household. Her identity as a woman, not only socially and religiously, but also personally and sexually, is called into question, as she occupies this role and develops an intimate, loving connection with Hadass, complete with hinted sexual chemistry.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fernley|first=Allison|author2=Paula Maloof |title=Yentl by Barbra Streisand|journal=Film Quarterly|date=Spring 1985|volume=38|issue=3|page=43|doi=10.1525/fq.1985.38.3.04a00070}}</ref>\n\nIn Singer's story, this dual betrayal of nature and the divine plan dooms Yentl to a life of pain, alienation, and shameful dishonesty. After her marriage ends in disaster, Yentl remains trapped forever in her disguise, unable to find redemption from her rejection of a normal life\u2014a take on the legend of the [[Wandering Jew]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fernley|first=Allison|author2=Paula Maloof |title=Yentl by Barbra Streisand|journal=Film Quarterly|date=Spring 1985|volume=38|issue=3|pages=39\u201341|doi=10.1525/fq.1985.38.3.04a00070}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Whitfield|first=Stephen|title=Yentl|journal=Jewish Social Studies|date=Autumn 1998 \u2013 Winter 1999|volume=5|issue=1/2|pages=170\u2013171|doi=10.2979/jss.1998.5.1-2.154}}</ref>\n\nIn Streisand's film, Yentl's defiance of expectation and definition, a rejection of sexist gender roles, is treated as a virtue. Though Yentl faces difficult choices in her attempt to live the life of her choosing, including sacrificing her love of Avigdor, she finds herself capable of following her dreams, of feeling different forms of love and intimacy with both sexes, as well as emerging from confusion and ambiguity with a powerful, independent sense of self-worth. At the film's conclusion, Yentl takes this developed, ever-evolving self to America to seek new possibilities and opportunities for discovery. Singer criticized the film's ending as hopelessly unrealistic, but the ending serves more as an affirmation of Yentl's independence and relentless optimism than a historically fitting conclusion to the narrative.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/04/27/reviews/streisand-singer.html \"I. B. Singer Talks to I. B. Singer About the Movie 'Yentl'\".

Her difficult experiences expand, rather than trap her personality. She does not conform to expectations from her surroundings or from her audience, neither remaining merely a woman hiding in men's clothing nor revealing herself to be neutered or firmly homosexual. She refuses to accept a limited, traditional life, even when offered one in marriage to Avigdor. Rather, Yentl becomes a \"real woman\", thoroughly modern and encompassing \"what society has defined as both masculine and feminine traits\".<ref name=\"Fernley 39\u201340\">{{cite journal|last=Fernley|first=Allison|author2=Paula Maloof |title=Yentl by Barbra Streisand |journal=Film Quarterly |date=Spring 1985 |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=39\u201340 |doi=10.1525/fq.1985.38.3.04a00070}}</ref> In the end, her pain, her confusion, and her loss never destroy her hope or resolve. She remains assertive and defiant, daring to find or to create room for new self-definition and new possibility, without seeking simple or complete resolution to ongoing challenges in her constant thirst for more.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n\nAlthough Isaac Bashevis Singer insisted that ''Yentl'' does not have feminist undertones,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Whitfield|first=Stephen|title=Yentl|journal=Jewish Social Studies|date=January 1999|volume=5|issue=1/2|pages=76\u2013154|doi=10.2979/jss.1998.5.1-2.154}}</ref> many critics and viewers of the film consider Yentl to be a feminist role model. One reason is that she rebels against patriarchal Orthodox Jewish society by disguising herself as a man to do what she loves\u2014study the Torah. Another reason is that although she finds herself in love with Avigdor, she has the strength to leave him behind, in exchange for a freer life in the US.<ref name=\"Fernley 39\u201340\"/>\n\n===Jewish-American themes===\nStreisand's interpretation of I. B. Singer's \"Yentl the Yeshiva Boy\" has philosophical implications as a Jewish-American film. Streisand changed Singer's specific ending, in which Yentl wanders off, presumably to a different yeshiva, to continue her studies and her cross-dressing. In the film interpretation of the story, Yentl moves on, but this time to the US. Viewers are led to believe that in the States she can have both study and womanhood. This idea symbolizes a refusal to conform to old-world Jewish standards and instead move \"against the authority and authenticity of the Judaic past\", which Streisand asserts has \"propelled itself so far from the austerity of Talmudic study\".<ref name=\"Whitfield 1999 154\">{{cite journal |last=Whitfield |first=Stephen |title=Yentl |journal=Jewish Social Studies |date=31 January 1999 |page=154}}</ref>\n\nOften, Jewish-American immigrants who struck out on their own were unable to dedicate the amount of time and energy into text study that their ancestors had; their lives instead were characterized by an \"individualism and experimentalism\" that \"Jewish immigrants and their descendants have so strikingly honored, reinforced, and revised\".<ref name=\"Whitfield 1999 154\"/> The differences between the written version of this story, which originated in Warsaw, and the American film interpretation thus symbolize a potential philosophical shift from the self-understanding of Eastern-European Jewry to Jewish-American self-understanding: it suggests America can potentially alter preexisting Jewish values.<ref name=\"Whitfield 1999 154\"/>\n\n=== Sexual themes ===\n''Yentl'' blurs lines between male and female and its characters develop attractions that could be seen as homosexual, although the film upholds a heterosexual sensibility. Yentl's desire is exclusively for her study partner, Avigdor, while her marriage to a woman remains unconsummated and at times is comical.  Her choice to reveal herself as a woman to Avigdor in hopes of gaining his love firmly establishes her self-determination.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rigney |first=Melissa |title=Brandon Goes to Hollywood: Boys Don't Cry and the Transgender Body in Film |journal=Film Criticism |date=Winter 2003}}</ref>\n\nWhile ''Yentl'' does not take its characters outside the realm of heterosexuality, the film critically questions the \"appropriateness of gender roles\" as determined by society.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fernley|first=Allison|author2=Paula Maloof |title=Yentl|journal=Film Quarterly |date=1985 |volume=38 |issue=3 |page=41}}</ref> Ultimately it argues that the society Yentl lives in does not allow equal opportunities for happiness for all people, especially women. In this way, it can be read as a potentially feminist text.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|1}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0086619|Yentl}}\n* {{tcmdb title|17854|Yentl}}\n* {{AFI film|58166}}\n* {{mojo title|yentl|Yentl}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|yentl|Yentl}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=Yentl}}\n\n{{Barbra Streisand}}\n{{Isaac Bashevis Singer}}\n{{Jack Rosenthal}}\n{{Films about Orthodox and Hasidic Jews}}\n{{GoldenGlobeBestMotionPictureMusicalComedy 1981-2000}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Yentl (Film)}}\n[[Category:1983 films]]\n[[Category:1980s musical drama films]]\n[[Category:1983 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:1980s musical films]]\n[[Category:American musical drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic musical films]]\n[[Category:Best Musical or Comedy Picture Golden Globe winners]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1904]]\n[[Category:Films set in Poland]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Original Score Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Cross-dressing in American films]]\n[[Category:1980s feminist films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Michel Legrand]]\n[[Category:Films about Jews and Judaism]]\n[[Category:American films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Isaac Bashevis Singer]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Barbra Streisand]]\n[[Category:Same-sex marriage in film]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Barbra Streisand]]\n[[Category:United Artists films]]\n[[Category:American historical romance films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related musical films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in the Czech Republic]]\n[[Category:Barwood Films films]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Barbra Streisand]]\n[[Category:Films based on adaptations]]\n[[Category:Films whose director won the Best Director Golden Globe]]\n[[Category:American historical musical films]]\n[[Category:1983 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:Films about Orthodox and Hasidic Jews]]\n[[Category:Films about LGBT and Judaism]]\n[[Category:1983 drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
