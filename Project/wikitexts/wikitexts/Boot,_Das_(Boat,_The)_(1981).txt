It has been exhibited both as a [[theatrical release]] and a TV [[miniseries]] (1985). There are also several different [[home video]] versions as well as a [[director's cut]] supervised by Petersen in 1997.\n\nAn [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of [[Lothar-G\u00fcnther Buchheim]]'s 1973 German novel of the same name based on his experiences aboard {{GS|U-96|1940|6}}, the film is set during [[World War II]] and follows ''U-96'' and its crew, as they set out on a hazardous patrol in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. It depicts both the excitement of battle and the tedium of the fruitless hunt, and shows the men serving aboard [[U-boat#World War II (1939\u20131945)|U-boats]] as ordinary individuals with a desire to do their best for their comrades and their country.\n\nDevelopment began in 1979. Several American directors were considered three years earlier before the film was shelved. During production, [[Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock]], the captain of the real ''U-96'' during Buchheim's 1941 patrol and one of Germany's top U-boat \"tonnage aces\" during the war, and Hans-Joachim Krug, former first officer on {{GS|U-219||2}}, served as consultants. One of Petersen's goals was to guide the audience through \"a journey to the edge of the mind\" (the film's German tagline {{lang|de|Eine Reise ans Ende des Verstandes}}), showing \"what war is all about\".<ref>{{Cite book |last=McCaulay |first=Philip Martin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RQ_YAQAAQBAJ&dq=wolfgang+petersen+%22what+war+is+all+about%22&pg=PA61 |title=World War II Movies |year=2010 |publisher=Lulu.com |isbn=978-0-557-30299-4 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nProduced with a budget of [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]&nbsp;32&nbsp;million (about $18.5&nbsp;million, equivalent to [[Euro|\u20ac]]{{Inflation|DE|32|1982}} million {{Inflation-year|DE}}), the film's high production cost ranks it among the most expensive films in [[Cinema of Germany|German cinema]], but the film was a commercial success and grossed $84.9&nbsp;million worldwide (equivalent to $220 million in 2020).

He is driven by its captain and chief engineer to a raucous French bordello where he meets some of the crew. Thomsen, another captain, gives a crude drunken speech to celebrate his [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|''Ritterkreuz'' award]], in which he mocks [[Adolf Hitler]].\n\nThe next morning, ''U-96'' sails out of the [[harbour]] of [[La Rochelle]] and Werner is given a tour of the boat. As time passes, he observes ideological differences between the new crew members and the hardened veterans, particularly the captain, who is embittered and cynical about the war. The new men, including Werner, are mocked by the rest of the crew, who share a tight bond. One Nazi officer, ''1-WO'' (the 1st [watch] officer), is disliked by the others. After days of boredom, the crew is excited by another U-boat's spotting of an enemy convoy, but they are soon spotted by a British [[destroyer]] and bombarded with [[depth charge]]s. They escape with only light damage.\n\nThe next three weeks are spent enduring a relentless North Atlantic gale. Morale drops after a series of misfortunes, but the crew is cheered temporarily by a chance encounter with Thomsen's boat. Shortly after the storm ends, the boat encounters a British [[convoy]] and quickly launches three torpedoes, sinking two ships. They are spotted by a destroyer and have to dive below test depth, the [[Submarine depth ratings|submarine's rated limit]]. During the ensuing depth-charge attack, the chief machinist, Johann, panics and has to be restrained. The boat sustains heavy damage, but is eventually able to safely surface when night falls. A British tanker they torpedoed is still afloat and on fire, so they torpedo it again, only to learn there are still sailors aboard. The crew watch in horror as the sailors leap overboard and swim towards them. Unable to accommodate prisoners, the captain orders the boat away.\n\nThe worn-out U-boat crew looks forward to returning home to La Rochelle in time for [[Christmas]], but the ship is ordered to [[La Spezia]], Italy, which means passing through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]\u2014an area heavily defended by the [[Royal Navy]]. The U-boat makes a secret night rendezvous at the harbour of [[Vigo]], in [[Neutral country|neutral]] although [[Francoist Spain|Axis-friendly Spain]], with the SS ''Weser'', an [[interned]] German [[merchant ship]] that clandestinely provides U-boats with fuel, torpedoes, and other supplies. The filthy officers seem out of place at the opulent dinner prepared for them, but are warmly greeted by enthusiastic officers eager to hear their exploits. The captain learns from an envoy of the German consulate that his request for Werner and the Chief Engineer to be sent back to Germany has been denied.\n\nThe crew finishes resupplying and departs for Italy. As they carefully approach the Strait of Gibraltar and are just about to dive, they are suddenly attacked and heavily damaged by a British [[fighter plane]], wounding the navigator, Kriechbaum. The captain orders the boat directly south towards the North African coast at full speed, determined to save his crew even if he loses the boat. British warships begin shelling and they are forced to dive. When attempting to level off, the boat does not respond and continues to sink until, just before being crushed by the pressure, it lands on a sea shelf, at the depth of 280 metres. The crew works desperately to make numerous repairs before running out of oxygen. After over 16 hours, they are able to surface by blowing their [[ballast tank]]s, and limp back towards La Rochelle under cover of darkness.\n\nThe crew is exhausted when they finally reach La Rochelle on Christmas Eve. Shortly after Kriechbaum is taken ashore to a waiting ambulance, [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] planes bomb and strafe the facilities, wounding or killing many of the crew. Ullmann, Johann, the 2nd Watch Officer, and the {{lang|de|Bibelforscher}} are killed. Frenssen, {{lang|de|Bootsmann}} Lamprecht, and Hinrich are wounded. After the raid, Werner leaves the [[submarine pen|U-boat bunker]] in which he had taken shelter and finds the captain, badly injured by shrapnel, watching his U-boat sink in the dock. Just after the boat disappears under the water, the captain collapses and dies. Werner rushes to his body, and surveys the grim scene with tears in his eyes.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:DasBootcast.png|thumb|right|The U-96 officers. From left to right: the II.

Werner is mocked for his lack of experience, and soon learns the true horrors of service on a U-boat.\n* [[Klaus Wennemann]] as Chief Engineer ({{lang|de|[[Leitender Ingenieur]]}} or LI, Rank: {{lang|de|Oberleutnant}}): A quiet and well-respected man. At age 27, the oldest crew member besides the Captain.

The second most important crewman, as he oversees diving operations and makes sure the systems are running correctly.\n* [[Hubertus Bengsch]] as 1st Watch Officer (I. WO, Rank: {{lang|de|Oberleutnant}}): A young, by-the-book officer, an ardent [[Nazi]] and a staunch believer in the {{lang|de|[[Endsieg]]}}. He has a condescending attitude and is the only crewman who makes the effort to maintain his proper uniform and trim appearance while all the others grow their beards in the traditional [[U-Bootwaffe]] fashion. He was raised in some wealth in Mexico by his stepparents who owned a plantation. His German fianc\u00e9e died in a British air raid.

When he is introduced, he is extremely drunk and briefly mocks Hitler on the stage of the French bordello. (In the \"Director's Cut\" DVD [[audio commentary]], Petersen says that Sander was really drunk while they were shooting the scene.) Sometime after ''U-96'' departs, Thomsen is deployed once again and the two submarines meet randomly in the middle of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] being put off course by the storm. This upsets the Captain because it means that there is now a gap in the blockade chain. After failing to make contact later, it becomes apparent that Thomsen's boat is missing. When ''U-96'' intercepts the convoy and sees they are without escorts, the Captain makes the observation that they must be away chasing down another boat; this boat is probably Thomsen's.\n* [[G\u00fcnter Lamprecht]] as the Captain of the ''Weser'': An enthusiastic officer aboard the resupply ship ''Weser''. He mistakes the 1st Watch Officer for the Captain as they enter the ship's elegant dining room. An ardent Nazi, he complains about the frustration of not being able to fight, but boasts about the food that has been prepared for the crew and the ship's \"specialities\".\n* [[Sky du Mont]] as an officer aboard the ''Weser'' (uncredited).\n\n== Production ==\nIn late 1941, war correspondent [[Lothar-G\u00fcnther Buchheim]] joined {{GS|U-96|1940|2}} for her 7th patrol, during the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].<ref name=Uziel>{{cite book |author=Daniel Uziel |author-link = Daniel Uziel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1pKnPzrPD7sC&q=buchheim%20iron%20cross&pg=PA402 |title=The Propaganda Warriors: The Wehrmacht and the Consolidation of the German Home Front |location=Bern / Oxford |publisher=Lang |year=2008 |isbn=978-3-03911-532-7 |page=402 }}</ref><ref name=Grauniad>{{cite news |author=Dan van der Vat |author-link = Dan van der Vat |url=https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,2026462,00.html |title=Obituary: Lothar-G\u00fcnther Buchheim |date=5 March 2007 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> His orders were to photograph and describe the U-boat in action. In 1973, Buchheim published a novel based on his wartime experiences, {{lang|de|Das Boot}} (The Boat), a fictionalised autobiographical account narrated by a \"Leutnant Werner\".

Several American directors were considered, and the {{lang|de|Kaleun}} ({{lang|de|Kapit\u00e4nleutnant}}) was to be played by [[Robert Redford]]. Disagreements sprang up among various parties and the project was shelved. Another Hollywood production was attempted with other American directors in mind, this time with the {{lang|de|Kaleun}} to be portrayed by [[Paul Newman]]. This effort primarily failed due to technical concerns, for example, how to film the close encounter of the two German submarines at sea during a storm.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}\n\nProduction of ''Das Boot'' took two years (1979\u20131981) and was the most expensive German film at the time.<ref name=Winds/> Most of the filming was done in one year; to make the appearance of the actors as realistic as possible, scenes were filmed in sequence over the course of the year. This ensured natural growth of beards and hair, increasing skin pallor, and signs of strain on the actors, who had, just like real U-boat men, spent many months in a cramped, unhealthy atmosphere.\n\nThe production included the construction of several models of different sizes, as well as a complete, detailed reconstruction of the interior of the {{GS|U-96|1940|2}}, a [[German Type VII submarine|Type VIIC-class U-boat]].\n\nHans-Joachim Krug, former first officer on ''U-219'', served as a consultant, as did [[Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock]], the captain of the real ''U-96''.\n\nThe film features both Standard German-speakers and [[dialect]] speakers. Petersen states in the DVD audio commentary that young men from throughout Germany and Austria were recruited for the film, as he wanted faces and dialects that would accurately reflect the diversity of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] around 1941. All of the main actors are bilingual in German and English, and when the film was dubbed into English, each actor recorded his own part (with the exception of Martin Semmelrogge, who only dubbed his own role in the Director's Cut). The German version is dubbed as well, as the film was shot \"silent\", because the dialogue spoken on-set would have been drowned out by the [[gyroscope]]s in the special camera developed for filming. Unusually, the film's German version actually grossed much higher than the English-dubbed version at the United States box office.<ref name=\"indiewire.com\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.indiewire.com/1999/08/editorial-life-isnt-beautiful-anymore-its-dubbed-82123/ |title = EDITORIAL: Life Isn't Beautiful Anymore, it's Dubbed|date = 23 August 1999}}</ref><ref name=\"Archived copy\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html |title=Will Dubbing Fly in the U.S.?

Two full-size mock-ups of a Type VIIC boat were built, one representing the portion above water for use in outdoor scenes, and the other a cylindrical tube on a motion mount (hydraulic [[gimbal]]) for the interior scenes. The mock-ups were built according to U-boat plans from [[Chicago]]'s [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]].\n\nThe outdoor mock-up was basically a shell propelled with a small engine, and stationed in La Rochelle, France, and has a history of its own. One morning the production crew walked out to where they kept it afloat and found it missing. Someone had forgotten to inform the crew that an American filmmaker had rented the mock-up for his own film shooting in the area. This filmmaker was [[Steven Spielberg]] and the film he was shooting was ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.<ref>{{cite book | author=Marcus Hearn | title =The Cinema of George Lucas | publisher =Harry N.

The full-sized mock-up was used during the Gibraltar surface scenes; the attacking aircraft (played by a [[North American T-6 Texan]] / Harvard) and rockets were real while the British ships were models.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}\n\nA mock-up of a conning tower was placed in a water tank at the [[Bavaria Film Studios|Bavaria Studios]] in [[Munich]] for outdoor scenes not requiring a full view of the boat's exterior. When filming on the outdoor mockup or the conning tower, jets of cold water were hosed over the actors to simulate the breaking ocean waves. A half-sized full hull operating model was used for underwater shots and some surface running shots, in particular the meeting in stormy seas with another U-boat. The tank was also used for the shots of British sailors jumping from their ship; a small portion of the tanker hull was constructed for these shots.\n\nDuring the filming there was a scene where actor [[Jan Fedder]] (Pilgrim) fell off the bridge while the U-boat was surfaced. During the played rescue, Bernd Tauber (Chief Helmsmann Kriechbaum) really broke two ribs.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.focus.de/kultur/kino_tv/wiedersehen-unter-veteranen-das-boot_id_2000568.html |title=Wiedersehen unter Veteranen |language=German | magazine=Focus |date=2013-09-03 |accessdate=2021-08-28}}</ref> This event is often purported as Jan Fedder breaking the ribs.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082096/trivia| title = \"Das Boot\" on imdb.com| website = [[IMDb]]}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align:left\" caption=\"Mock-up of the interior at the Bavaria Studios in Munich\">\nFile:Bavaria Filmstudio Das Boot 1.jpg\nFile:Bavaria Filmstudio Das Boot 4.jpg\nFile:Bavaria Filmstudio Das Boot 5.jpg\nFile:Bavaria Filmstudio Das Boot 6.jpg\n</gallery>\n\nThe interior U-boat mock-up was mounted five metres off the floor and was shaken, rocked, and tilted up to 45 degrees by means of a hydraulic apparatus, and was vigorously shaken to simulate depth charge attacks. Petersen was admittedly obsessive about the structural detail of the U-boat set, remarking that \"every screw\" in the set was an authentic facsimile of the kind used in a [[World War II]] U-boat. In this he was considerably assisted by the numerous photographs [[Lothar-G\u00fcnther Buchheim]] had taken during his own voyage on the historical ''U-96'', some of which had been published in his 1976 book, {{lang|de|U-Boot-Krieg}} (\"U-Boat War\").\n\nThroughout the filming, the actors were forbidden to go out in sunlight, to create the pallor of men who seldom saw the sun during their missions.

The rest of the officers are either indifferent or openly anti-Nazi (the Captain).  The enlisted sailors and NCO are portrayed as apolitical. In his book ''[[Iron Coffins]]'', former U-boat commander Herbert A. Werner states that the selection of naval personnel based on their loyalty to the party only occurred later in the war (from 1943 onward)  when the U-boats were suffering high casualties and when morale was declining{{Citation needed|date=January 2022}}. Such a degree of skepticism may or may not have occurred.
