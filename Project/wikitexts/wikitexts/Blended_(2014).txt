To their surprise, they both end up at the same African safari resort with their children and are forced to stay together. The film's [[ensemble cast]] also features [[Bella Thorne]], [[Emma Fuhrmann]], [[Terry Crews]], [[Joel McHale]], [[Wendi McLendon-Covey]], [[Kevin Nealon]], and [[Shaquille O'Neal]].

Lauren and Jim run into each other while on errands to the pharmacy, and the cashier mistakenly switches their credit cards. Jim goes to Lauren's house to switch the credit cards back. Jen is at Lauren's house and has broken up with her boyfriend Dick, Jim's boss, although she and Dick had already paid for a trip to Africa. Lauren commits to using Jen's portion of the vacation package without knowing that Jim intends to use Dick's as well and that the hotel accommodation is for a romantic suite.\n\nThe families are put together for a \"blended familymoon\", where they get together with other couples, including the oversexed Eddy and Ginger. Eddy's new bride is quite his junior, to the chagrin of their teenage son Jake, on whom Jim's oldest daughter Hilary develops a crush at first sight. The kids make an awkward impression with each other, with Brendan calling his mother \"hot,\" and the others not knowing how to react to Espn acting like her mother is there with her, as she is not ready to let go of her yet. Over time the kids begin to bond with each other and each other's parent.\n\nJim bonds with the boys, helping them with adventurous sports, while Lauren bonds with the girls, helping Hilary to change her [[tomboy]]ish look into a more feminine one, leading to Jake becoming her boyfriend. As they become closer to their children, Jim and Lauren begin to warm up to each other. They inadvertently get together for a couples' massage and have fun with each other. When Lou asks Lauren to put her to bed, Lauren sings her \"[[Over the Rainbow]],\" which, unknown to her, was the song Lou's mother used to sing. The other girls pretend to sleep, while discovering how much they truly love Lauren. She returns this feeling when she maternally kisses each girl's forehead as she says goodnight. Jim starts to experience deeper feelings for Lauren.\n\nOn the last night of the trip, Lauren puts on a black dress that she admired earlier. She wears it that evening and receives admiration from everyone. Jim and Lauren are sat down for a romantic dinner, which Lauren soon discovers was actually planned by Jim specifically for her. They chat briefly about basic parenting techniques and then pull in for a kiss; however, at the last second, Jim pulls away, apologizing and explaining that he \"can't do it\".\n\nAfter returning to America, Jim realizes he misses Lauren and that he has fallen in love with her, which he admits to his daughters who are ecstatic with the news. Although Espn is not fully ready to move on from her mother's death, she also does not want her family to lose Lauren. She tells her father that her mother said that she had other things to do in [[Heaven]], and would not be around as much. At the kids' behest, Jim goes to Lauren's house to give her flowers, only to find her ex-husband Mark there. Tyler gets excited to see Jim and wants to play ball; Mark bullies Jim into leaving, then ditches Tyler to answer a summons from work. Mark tries to make a move on Lauren, but she refuses his advances because of his continuous failure to be a good father, in addition to his having an affair during their marriage.\n\nLauren and Brendan go to support Tyler at his next baseball game, along with Jen and Dick, whom Jen has worked things out with, and his five kids. Mark does not come to the game. Jim and his daughters arrive to show encouragement, inspiring Tyler to hit the ball as Jim had taught him in Africa. Jim then finds Lauren and they admit to wanting to be together, and they kiss, to the happiness of their kids, who know that they are already a blended family.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Jim Friedman\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Lauren Reynolds\n* [[Bella Thorne]] as Hilary \"Larry\" Friedman, Jim's oldest daughter\n* Braxton Beckham as Brendan Reynolds, Lauren's older son\n* [[Emma Fuhrmann]] as Espen \"ESPN\" Friedman, Jim's middle daughter\n* Kyle Red Silverstein as Tyler Reynolds, Lauren's younger son\n* [[Alyvia Alyn Lind]] as Louise \"Lou\" Friedman, Jim's youngest daughter\n* [[Terry Crews]] as Nickens\n* [[Kevin Nealon]] as Eddy Warnick\n* Jessica Lowe as Ginger Warnick, Eddy's wife\n* Zak Henri as Jake Warnick, Eddy's son\n* [[Wendi McLendon-Covey]] as Jen Palmer, Lauren's friend and co-worker\n* [[Joel McHale]] as Mark Reynolds, Lauren's ex-husband\n* [[Jackie Sandler]] as Hollywood stepmom\n* [[Jared Sandler]] as cute teenage boy\n* Abdoulaye N'Gom as Mfana, trip's tour guide\n}}\n\nIn addition, [[Shaquille O'Neal]] appears as Doug; [[Dan Patrick (sportscaster)|Dan Patrick]], longtime anchor of [[ESPN]]'s ''[[SportsCenter]]'', appears as Dick; [[South African Cricket Team|South African]] cricketer [[Dale Steyn]] plays himself; [[Lauren Lapkus]] appears as Tracy the babysitter; [[Mary Pat Gleason]] appears as a pharmacy cashier; [[Allen Covert]] and [[Alexis Arquette]] make cameo appearances reprising their roles as Ten Second Tom and Georgina from ''[[50 First Dates]]'' and ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'', respectively.
