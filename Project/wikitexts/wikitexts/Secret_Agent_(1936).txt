Somerset Maugham]].<ref name=\"HitchcockGuide\">{{cite web|url=https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide-secret-agent-1936|title=Alfred Hitchcock Collectors' Guide: Secret Agent (1936)|work=Brenton Film}}</ref> The film stars [[Madeleine Carroll]], [[Peter Lorre]], [[John Gielgud]], and [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]].<ref name=\"HitchcockGuide\"/> It also features uncredited appearances by [[Michael Redgrave]], future star of Hitchcock's ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938) and [[Michael Rennie]] in his film debut.\n\nTypical [[Hitchcockian]] themes used in ''Secret Agent'' include [[mistaken identity]], trains and a \"Hitchcock Blonde\".\n\n==Plot==\nOn 10 May 1916, during [[World War I]], British Captain and novelist Edgar Brodie returns home on leave, only to discover his obituary in the newspaper. He is brought to a man identifying himself only as \"R\", who asks him to undertake a secret mission: to identify and eliminate a German agent on his way to [[Arabia]] to stir up trouble in the Middle East. Upon agreeing, Brodie is given a new identity\u2014Richard Ashenden\u2014a fake death, and the assistance of a killer known variously as \"the Hairless Mexican\" and \"the General\", though he is neither bald, Mexican, nor a general.\n\nBrodie's late \"predecessor\" thought that the enemy agent was staying at the Hotel Excelsior in neutral [[Switzerland]]. When \"Ashenden\" arrives there, he is surprised to find that \"R\" has also provided him with an attractive wife, Elsa Carrington. Entering their suite, he also encounters her new admirer, fellow hotel guest Robert Marvin, who is only slightly deterred by the arrival of her husband (and continues to flirt with Elsa). When they are alone, Ashenden is displeased when Elsa reveals she insisted upon the assignment for the thrill of it.\n\nAshenden and the General go to contact a double agent, the church organist, only to find him dead. In his hand, however, they find a button, evidently torn off in the struggle with his killer. When they go to the casino to meet Elsa, the button is accidentally dropped onto a gambling table. Since it looks the same as his own buttons, an experienced mountaineer named Caypor assumes it is his.\n\nThe agents persuade Caypor to help them settle a concocted bet: which one of them can climb higher on a nearby mountain. As the moment approaches, Ashenden finds he is unable to commit cold-blooded murder, but the General has no such qualms and pushes the unsuspecting Caypor off a cliff.\n\nHowever, a coded telegram informs them that Caypor is not their target. The General finds it very funny, but Elsa becomes terribly distraught when they are told. She decides to quit, despite having told Ashenden that she fell in love with him at first sight. In the lobby, she encounters Marvin. With no destination in mind, she persuades him to take her along with him. Meanwhile, the other two bribe a worker at a chocolate factory (the secret \"German spy post office\") to show them a very important message received the day before. They discover that it is addressed to none other than Marvin.\n\nAshenden and the General set out in pursuit, taking the same train as Marvin and Elsa. Before they can arrange anything, the train crosses the border into [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]] \u2013 enemy territory \u2013 and a large number of soldiers board. Despite this, they manage to get Marvin alone in his compartment. Objecting to cold-blooded murder, Elsa draws a pistol. Before Ashenden can do anything, one way or the other, the train is attacked and derailed by airplanes sent by \"R\". Marvin is pinned in the wreckage, but manages to shoot the General fatally before dying. The \"Ashendens\" quit the spy business.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Gielgud]] as Captain Edgar Brodie/Richard Ashenden\n* [[Peter Lorre]] as The General\n* [[Madeleine Carroll]] as Elsa Carrington/Mrs. Ashenden\n* [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]] as Robert Marvin\n* [[Percy Marmont]] as Caypor\n* [[Florence Kahn (actress)|Florence Kahn]] as Mrs. Caypor\n* [[Charles Carson (actor)|Charles Carson]] as \"R\"\n* [[Lilli Palmer]] as Lilli\n* [[Howard Marion-Crawford]] as Karl (uncredited) \n* [[Michael Rennie]] as Army Captain (uncredited)\n\n==Reception==\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film \"good spy entertainment,\" adding that Hitchcock had \"done well at blending the tale's grim theme with deftly fashioned humor, appropriate romantic interplay and some swell outdoor photography.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=June 17, 1936 |title=Secret Agent |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=23 }}</ref> ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' declared it \"A pretty good espionage melodrama.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=June 27, 1936 |title=Film review: Secret Agent |journal=[[Harrison's Reports]] |page=103 }}</ref> [[John Mosher (writer)|John Mosher]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' called it a \"good picture,\" adding, \"''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' was a first-rate English thriller, you may know, and the bright, quick fresh touch that made it good isn't lacking here.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mosher |first=John |author-link=John Mosher (writer) |date=June 13, 1936 |title=The Current Cinema |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |page=67 }}</ref>\n\n''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' praised the \"technical quality\" of the film and called the acting \"good,\" but thought that the ending was \"brief and not very satisfactory\" and that it was \"often difficult to know quite what [Hitchcock] is getting at, whether he is making a profound protest against war and senseless murder or just presenting simple melodrama.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=May 1936 |title=Secret Agent |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=3 |issue=29 |page=83 }}</ref> B. R. Crisler of ''[[The New York Times]]'' disliked the film, praising Peter Lorre for his performance as \"one of the most amusing and somehow one of the most wistfully appealing trigger men since [[Victor Moore]],\" but criticizing technical aspects such as \"inexpert camera technique\" and \"strangely uneven sound recording.\" He also thought Madeleine Carroll was a \"waste\" in her role.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Crisler |first=B.

According to Greene, these \"melodramatic situations\" are built perfunctorily \"paying no attention on the way to inconsistencies, loose ends, psychological absurdities[,] and then drop[ped:] they mean nothing: they lead to nothing\". Greene jokes that the element of humour may have at least livened the film with laughter.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Greene|first= Graham|author-link= Graham Greene|date= 15 May 1936|title= The Trail of the Lonesome Pine/Secret Agent|journal= [[The Spectator]]}} (reprinted in: {{cite book|editor-last= Taylor|editor-first= John Russell|editor-link= John Russell Taylor|date= 1980|title= The Pleasure Dome|url= https://archive.org/details/pleasuredomegrah00gree/page/74|pages= [https://archive.org/details/pleasuredomegrah00gree/page/74 74\u201375]|isbn= 0192812866|url-access= registration}})</ref>\n \nThe film was voted the fifth best British film of 1936.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article52148556 |title=BEST FILM PERFORMANCE LAST YEAR. |newspaper=[[The Examiner (Tasmania)|The Examiner]] |location=Launceston, Tasmania |date=9 July 1937 |access-date=4 March 2013 |page=8|edition=LATE NEWS EDITION and DAILY|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> It currently has a 90% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with Geoff Andrew of ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' writing, \"This thriller may not be one of Hitchcock's best English films, but it is full of startling [[set piece (filmmaking)|set piece]]s and quirky characterisation\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1018483-secret_agent/ |title=Secret Agent (1936) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=January 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Copyright and home video status==\n''Secret Agent'', like all of Hitchcock's British films, is copyrighted worldwide<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide#slaying-the-public-domain-myth|title=Alfred Hitchcock Collectors' Guide: Slaying the public domain myth|website=Brenton Film}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-dial-c-for-copyright|title=Alfred Hitchcock: Dial \u00a9 for Copyright|website=Brenton Film}}</ref> but has been heavily [[Bootleg recording|bootlegged]] on home video.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/bootlegs-galore-the-great-alfred-hitchcock-rip-off|title=Bootlegs Galore: The Great Alfred Hitchcock Rip-off|website=Brenton Film}}</ref> Despite this, various licensed releases have appeared on [[DVD]] throughout Europe and in [[Australia]].<ref name=\"HitchcockGuide\"/> It was also released in the US on [[LaserDisc]] by [[The Criterion Collection]].<ref name=\"HitchcockGuide\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0028231|title=Secret Agent}}\n*[https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide-secret-agent-1936 ''Alfred Hitchcock Collectors\u2019 Guide: Secret Agent'' at Brenton Film]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20020623143456/http://www.zx.nu/ss/chapter3.htm \"Expressionism at its Height: ''Secret Agent''\"] from ''The Silent Scream: Alfred Hitchcock's Sound Track'' (1982) by Elisabeth Weis\n\n{{Alfred Hitchcock}}\n{{Michael Balcon}}\n{{Alma Reville}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Secret Agent (1936 Film)}}\n[[Category:1936 films]]\n[[Category:1930s romantic thriller films]]\n[[Category:British romantic thriller films]]\n[[Category:1930s spy thriller films]]\n[[Category:British spy thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films based on multiple works]]\n[[Category:British black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Films based on short fiction]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by W.
