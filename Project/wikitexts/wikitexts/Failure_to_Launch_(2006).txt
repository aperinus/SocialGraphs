The film focuses on a 35-year-old man living with his parents who shows no interest in leaving the comfortable life that they, especially his mother, have made for him. It was released on March 10, 2006, and grossed over $128 million.\n\n==Plot==\n35-year-old Tripp still lives with his parents Al and Sue in [[Baltimore]]. His best friends Demo and Ace also still live in their parents' homes and seem proud of it. Tripp has many casual girlfriends. When he\u2019s tired of them, he invites them to \u201chis place\"\u2014and when they realize he still lives at home, they promptly dump him.\n\nAl and Sue are fascinated when their friends, whose adult son recently left home, reveal they hired an expert to get him to move out. The expert is Paula, who believes that men continue to live at home because they have low self-esteem. Her approach is to establish a relationship with the man to build his confidence, then transfer his attachment from his parents to her.\n\nHowever, Tripp does not fit her previous profiles, as he has normal social skills, good self-esteem, and a good job he enjoys. After an awkward encounter with his parents, Paula thwarts Tripp's attempt to dump her and has sex with him, while developing real feelings. She and Tripp find themselves in unfamiliar waters and confide in their friends.\n\nPaula's vocation exasperates her roommate Kit, who thinks Paula took the job because a man broke her heart who lived with his parents. She is shocked to learn why Tripp lives at home: His life collapsed when his fianc\u00e9e suddenly died, and his family has been his solace ever since.\n\nAce discovers what is going on and blackmails Paula for a date with Kit. Although Kit is more attracted to Demo, she and Ace wind up falling in love. Ace then \"outs\"  Paula to Demo, who then tells all to Tripp. Tripp angrily confronts his parents and breaks up with Paula. Wracked with guilt, Paula refunds Al's and Sue's money. After an awkward confrontation, Tripp forgives his parents, but can't forgive Paula.\n\nTripp's parents and friends devise a plan to reconcile the two. They tie up and gag him, locking him and Paula together in a room. Paula pours her heart out, and he finally forgives her. The film ends with Al and Sue in their [[Empty nest syndrome|empty nest]], happily singing \"Hit the Road, Tripp\". This fades into the closing credits over the [[Hit the Road Jack|Ray Charles song]] \"Hit the Road, Jack\", and we see Tripp and Paula sail away on his newly purchased boat.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Tripp\n* [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] as Paula\n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Katherine \"Kit\"\n* [[Justin Bartha]] as Philip \"Ace\"\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as Demo\n* [[Terry Bradshaw]] as Al\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Sue\n* [[Adam Alexi-Malle]] as Mr. Axelrod\n* [[Tyrel Jackson Williams]] as Jeffrey\n* [[Katheryn Winnick]] as Melissa\n* [[Rob Corddry]] as Gun Salesman\n* [[Patton Oswalt]] as Techie Guy\n* [[Mageina Tovah]] as Barista\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as Bud\n* Kate McGregor-Stewart as Bev\n\n==Production==\nThe rock climbing scenes were filmed in Cherokee Rock Village in [[Leesburg, Alabama]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Cherokee Rock Village|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-3105|publisher=encyclopediaofalabama.org|access-date=31 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nIn its opening weekend, the film grossed a total of $24.6 million, ranking first in the [[United States]] [[box office]] results for that weekend.
