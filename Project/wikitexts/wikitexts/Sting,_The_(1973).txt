Created by screenwriter [[David S. Ward]], the story was inspired by real-life cons perpetrated by brothers Fred and Charley Gondorff and documented by [[David W. Maurer|David Maurer]] in his 1940 book ''The Big Con: The Story of the Confidence Man''.\n\nThe title phrase refers to the moment when a con artist finishes the \"play\" and takes the [[Mark (victim)|mark's]] money. If a con is successful, the mark does not realize he has been cheated until the con men are long gone, if at all. The film is played out in distinct sections with old-fashioned [[title card]]s drawn by artist Jaroslav \"Jerry\" Gebr, the lettering and illustrations rendered in a style reminiscent of the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]''. The film is noted for its anachronistic use of [[ragtime]], particularly the melody \"[[The Entertainer (rag)|The Entertainer]]\" by [[Scott Joplin]], which was adapted (along with others by Joplin) for the film by [[Marvin Hamlisch]] (and a top-ten chart single for Hamlisch when released as a single from the film's soundtrack).

The film also rekindled Newman's career after a series of big screen flops.  Regarded as having one of the best screenplays ever written, in 2005, ''The Sting'' was selected for preservation in the U.S. [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1936, during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], Johnny Hooker, a [[Confidence trick|grifter]] in [[Joliet, Illinois]], cons $11,000 in cash in a [[pigeon drop]] from an unsuspecting victim with the aid of his partners Luther Coleman and Joe Erie. Buoyed by the windfall, Luther announces his retirement and advises Hooker to seek out an old friend, Henry Gondorff, in [[Chicago]] to learn \"the big con\". Unfortunately, the reason their victim had so much cash was that he was a [[numbers racket]] courier for vicious crime boss Doyle Lonnegan. Corrupt Joliet police Lieutenant William Snyder confronts Hooker, revealing Lonnegan's involvement and demanding part of Hooker's cut. Having already blown his share on a single [[roulette]] spin, Hooker pays Snyder in counterfeit bills. Lonnegan's men murder both the courier and Luther, and Hooker flees for his life to Chicago.\n\nHooker finds Henry Gondorff, a once-great con-man now hiding from the [[FBI]], and asks for his help in taking on the dangerous Lonnegan. Gondorff is initially reluctant, but he relents and recruits a core team of experienced con men to dupe Lonnegan. They decide to resurrect an elaborate obsolete scam known as \"the wire\", using a larger crew of con artists to create a phony [[off-track betting]] parlor. Aboard the opulent ''[[20th Century Limited]]'', Gondorff, posing as boorish Chicago bookie Shaw, buys into Lonnegan's private, high-stakes [[poker]] game. He infuriates Lonnegan with obnoxious behavior, then out-cheats him to win $15,000. Hooker, posing as Shaw's disgruntled employee Kelly, is sent to collect the winnings and instead convinces Lonnegan that he wants to take over Shaw's operation. Kelly reveals that he has a partner named Les Harmon (actually con man Kid Twist) in the Chicago [[Western Union]] office, who will allow them to win bets on horse races by [[past-posting]].\n\nMeanwhile, Snyder has tracked Hooker to Chicago, but his pursuit is thwarted when he is summoned by undercover FBI agents led by Agent Polk, who orders him to assist in their plan to arrest Gondorff using Hooker. At the same time, Lonnegan has grown frustrated with the inability of his men to find and kill Hooker for the Joliet con. Unaware that Kelly is Hooker, he demands that Salino, his best assassin, be given the job. A mysterious figure with black leather gloves is then seen following and observing Hooker.\n\nKelly's connection appears effective, as Harmon provides Lonnegan with the winner of one horse race and the [[trifecta]] of another. Lonnegan agrees to finance a $500,000 bet at Shaw's parlor to break Shaw and gain revenge. Shortly thereafter, Snyder captures Hooker and brings him before FBI Agent Polk. Polk forces Hooker to betray Gondorff by threatening to incarcerate Luther Coleman's widow.\n\nThe night before the sting, Hooker sleeps with a waitress named Loretta. The next morning, he sees Loretta walking toward him. The black-gloved man appears behind Hooker and shoots her dead. The man reveals that he was hired by Gondorff to protect Hooker; Loretta was Lonnegan's hired killer, Loretta Salino, and had not yet killed Hooker because they were seen together.\n\nArmed with Harmon's tip to \"place it on Lucky Dan\", Lonnegan makes the $500,000 bet at Shaw's parlor on Lucky Dan to win. As the race begins, Harmon arrives and expresses shock at Lonnegan's bet: when he said \"place it\" he meant, literally, that Lucky Dan would \"place\" (i.e., [[Across the board|finish ''second'']]). In a panic, Lonnegan rushes to the teller window and demands his money back. A moment later Polk, Lt. Snyder, and a half dozen FBI agents storm the parlor. Polk confronts Gondorff, then tells Hooker he is free to go. Gondorff, reacting to the betrayal, shoots Hooker in the back. Polk then shoots Gondorff and orders Snyder to get the ostensibly respectable Lonnegan away from the crime scene. With Lonnegan and Snyder safely away, Hooker and Gondorff rise amid cheers and laughter. The gunshots were faked; Agent Polk is actually Hickey, a con man, running a con atop Gondorff's con to divert Snyder and ensure Lonnegan abandons the money. As the con men strip the room of its contents, Hooker refuses his share of the money, saying \"I'd only blow it\", and walks away with Gondorff.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Paul Newman]] as Henry \"Shaw\" Gondorff\n* [[Robert Redford]] as Johnny \"Kelly\" Hooker\n* [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]] as Doyle Lonnegan\n* [[Robert Earl Jones]] as Luther Coleman\n* [[Charles Durning]] as Lt.

Ward]] has said in an interviews that he was inspired to write ''The Sting'' while doing research on pickpockets, saying \"Since I had never seen a film about a confidence man before, I said I gotta do this.\" Daniel Eagan explained: \"One key to plots about con men is that film goers want to feel they are in on the trick. They don't have to know how a scheme works, and they don't mind a twist or two, but it's important for the story to feature clearly recognizable 'good' and 'bad' characters.\" It took a year for Ward to correctly adjust this aspect of the script and to figure out how much information he could hold back from the audience while still making the leads sympathetic. He also imagined an underground brotherhood of thieves who assemble for a big operation and then melt away after the \"mark\".<ref>{{cite book| first=Daniel| last=Eagan| title=America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry| publisher=Bloomsberry| year=2009| isbn=978-0-8264-2977-3| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/americasfilmlega0000eaga/page/700/mode/2up?q=%22underground+brotherhood%22| page=700| access-date=April 13, 2022}}</ref>\n\n[[Rob Cohen]] (later director of action films such as ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'') years later told of how he found the script in the slush pile when working as a [[script coverage|reader]] for [[Mike Medavoy]], a future studio head, but then an agent.  He wrote in his coverage that it was \"the great American screenplay and&nbsp;\u2026 will make an award-winning, major-cast, major-director film.\"  Medavoy said that he would try to sell it on that recommendation, promising to fire Cohen if he could not.

Shaw had slipped on a wet handball court at the Beverly Hills Hotel a week before filming began and had injured the ligaments in his knee. He wore a leg brace during production which was hidden under the wide 1930s style trousers.<ref name=IMDb />\n\n===Principal photography===\nHill decided that the film would be reminiscent of movies from the 1930s and watched films from that decade for inspiration. While studying '30s gangster films, Hill noticed that most of them rarely had extras. \"For instance,\" said Hill as quoted in Andrew Horton's 1984 book ''The Films of George Roy Hill'', \"no extras would be used in street scenes in those films: [[Jimmy Cagney]] would be shot down and die in an empty street.

Surtees]], Hill devised a colour scheme of muted browns and maroons for the film and a lighting design that combined old-fashioned 1930s-style lighting with some modern tricks of the trade to get the visual look he wanted. [[Edith Head]] designed a wardrobe of snappy period costumes for the cast, and artist Jaroslav Gebr created inter-title cards to be used between each section of the film that were reminiscent of the golden glow of old ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' illustrations, a popular publication of the 1930s.\n\n[[File:The Sting (film) on location in Pasadena.jpg|thumb|Filming on location in [[Pasadena, California]].
