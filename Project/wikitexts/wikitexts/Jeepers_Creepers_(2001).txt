It stars [[Gina Philips]] and [[Justin Long]] as Trish and Darry Jenner, two siblings in college who are pursued by the Creeper, a demonic serial killer portrayed by [[Jonathan Breck]]. The film takes its name from the [[Jeepers Creepers (song)|1938 song of the same name]], which is featured in the film under a version by [[Paul Whiteman]].<ref name=\"MainTheme\"/> [[Patricia Belcher]] and [[Eileen Brennan]] also appear in supporting roles, with Salva making a [[cameo appearance]].\n\nProduced by [[American Zoetrope]] and the German companies Cinerenta-Cinebeta and Cinerenta Medienbeteiligungs KG, ''Jeepers Creepers'' began production in August 2000 after Salva convinced the studios to cast Philips and Long with the help of executive producer [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. Due to severe budget cuts, the third act of the project was rewritten during production. Filming took place for two months in Florida in [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]], [[Dunnellon, Florida|Dunnellon]], [[Reddick, Florida|Reddick]], and [[Lake Panasoffkee, Florida|Lake Panasoffkee]]. The film was theatrically released by [[United Artists]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] on August 31, 2001. It was a commercial success, despite mixed reviews, and grossed $59 million on a $10 million budget. It was the first film in the [[Jeepers Creepers (film series)|''Jeepers Creepers'' film series]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\nTrish Jenner and her brother Darry are traveling home from college for [[spring break]]. As they drive through the [[Florida]] countryside, an old truck threateningly [[Tailgating|tailgate]]s them but eventually passes. They later observe the same truck parked next to an abandoned church with the driver sliding what appears to be bodies wrapped in blood-stained sheets into a large pipe sticking out of the ground. Having noticed their car pass by, the driver pursues and runs them off the road.\n\nAfter the truck drives off, Darry convinces Trish to go back to the church. Upon investigation, Darry hears noises coming from within the pipe and crawls inside with Trish holding on to his feet. Trish accidentally drops Darry, and he falls to the bottom of the pipe. Inside, he finds a dying man with stitches running down his stomach and hundreds of bodies sewn to the basement's walls and ceiling, including the bodies of a prom couple that had gone missing twenty-three years prior. Darry eventually finds his way out of the pipe, finds Trish, and they both flee the scene and attempt to contact the police at a diner. At the diner, they are phoned by a strange woman who tells them they are in danger. She then plays the song \"[[Jeepers Creepers (song)|Jeepers Creepers]]\" on a record player, telling them one of them will die screaming while hearing the song. Confused, they ignore her warning and leave with two police officers providing a security escort. As they travel, the police learn that the church has caught fire and any potential evidence has been destroyed. The police are then attacked and killed by the driver, who loads their bodies into the truck. Witnessing the aftermath, Trish and Darry drive off in terror.\n\nThe pair stop at the house of a reclusive, elderly woman, begging her to call the police. The woman complies until she notices the driver hiding in her yard, who kills her before revealing its inhuman face to Trish and Darry. Trish repeatedly runs the driver over with her car but is left horrified as she sees a giant wing tear through its trench coat and flap in the air. The pair leave and drive to a local police station, where they are approached by [[psychic]] Jezelle Gay Hartman, the woman who called them at the diner. She tells them the true nature of their pursuer: It is an ancient creature, known as \"the Creeper,\" which awakens every 23rd spring for twenty-three days to feast on human body parts, which then form parts of its own body. She also tells them that it seeks out its victims through fear, and by smelling the fear from Trish and Darry, it has found something it likes.\n\nThe wounded Creeper arrives at the police station, cuts off the power, and eats several prisoners to heal. The Creeper is swarmed by police but it kills a number of them and evades capture. Trapped, Jezelle warns Trish and Darry that one of them will die a horrible death. Darry demands to know who, and Jezelle looks at Trish. The Creeper finds them but spares Jezelle before cornering Trish and Darry in an upstairs interrogation room. After sniffing them, the Creeper throws Trish aside and chooses Darry. Trish offers her life for her brother's, but the Creeper escapes out of a window and flies away with Darry. The next day, Trish is picked up by her parents, and Jezelle returns home in regret. In an abandoned factory, it is revealed that the Creeper has removed the back of Darry's head and taken his eyes, all the while \"Jeepers Creepers\" plays on the Creeper's record player.\n\n==Cast==\nCredits adapted from the [[British Film Institute]].<ref name=\"BFI\"/>\n<!-- SOME NAMES ARE UNCAPITALIZED PER WP:FILMCAST -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Gina Philips]] as Trish Jenner\n* [[Justin Long]] as Darry Jenner\n* [[Jonathan Breck]] as the Creeper{{efn|name=a|Breck also portrays a bald cop.<ref name=\"JonathanBreckCast\"/>}}\n* [[Patricia Belcher]] as Jezelle Gay Hartman\n* [[Eileen Brennan]] as the cat lady\n* Brandon Smith as Sergeant Davis Tubbs\n* Jon Beshara as Trooper Robert Gideon\n* Avis-Marie Barnes as Trooper Natasha Weston\n* Tom Tarantini as Roach\n* Chris Shepardson as the dying boy\n* [[William Haze|Will Hasenzahl]] as an \"officer with hole in chest\"\n* [[Victor Salva]] as a victim of the Creeper<ref name=\"Commentary\"/>\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Jeepers Creepers finale - storyboard - Brad Parker.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=A storyboard by Brad Parker depicts a truck crashing and exploding into a train.|[[Brad Parker (artist)|Brad Parker]]'s [[storyboard]] of the film's original ending]]\n\nSeveral critics and moviegoers believe the film was loosely inspired by the case of Dennis DePue. In the state of [[Michigan]] in 1990, brother-and-sister Ray and Marie Thornton caught DePue dumping his dead wife's body behind an abandoned schoolhouse.<ref name=\"Inspiration1\"/> The murder case and subsequent [[Manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] of DePue were featured on an episode of ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' on March 20, 1991.<ref name=\"DennisDePue\"/> The following day, DePue committed suicide during a [[shootout]] with police in [[Mississippi]].<ref name=\"DePueDies\"/> The episode's reenactment of events, and many details contained throughout, were found to be similar to the opening scenes of the film.<ref name=\"Inspiration2\"/> Writer and director [[Victor Salva]] has not confirmed nor denied whether the film took inspiration from the case,<ref name=\"Inspiration2\"/> but instead said it borrowed elements from ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968) and ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]'' (1971).<ref name=\"FangoriaInterview\"/>\n\nIt took Salva one month to write the screenplay, down from his average of six months.<ref name=\"FangoriaInterview\"/> He said he wanted the Creeper to kill characters that were for the most part male because he was \"very tired of seeing women slaughtered and raped\" in cinema.<ref name=\"ThirdActChange\"/> To conceal his [[final girl]]-styled ending from viewers, Salva employed various [[red herring]]s throughout the first act so viewers would think Trish was going to die.<ref name=\"RedHerring\"/> His original script also featured a twenty-page third act which was eventually scrapped during production.<ref name=\"ThirdActChange\"/> In it, Darry drives the Creeper's truck into a train, unsuccessfully sacrificing himself in an attempt to kill the Creeper.<ref name=\"Script\"/> The entire sequence had been [[storyboard]]ed by [[Brad Parker (artist)|Brad Parker]] in preparation for the shoot but, due to a budget cut of $1 million, it had to be removed and rewritten.<ref name=\"ProductionCut\"/><ref name=\"GinaPhilipsScript\" /> Because of this, [[Gina Philips]] and [[Justin Long]] were allowed to improvise many of their scenes during the third act.<ref name=\"GinaPhilipsScript\" /> Some scenes cut from the script were used in its sequel, ''[[Jeepers Creepers 2]]''.<ref name=\"ThirdActChange\"/>\n\nSalva wanted the film's defining moment to be the reveal that the Creeper was not human and, to do so, kept the character mysterious throughout the first half by rewriting certain scenes, going against the advice of agents, managers, and acclaimed directors.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/><ref name=\"FangoriaInterview\"/><ref name=\"RedHerring\"/> Salva gave his finished screenplay to executive producer [[Francis Ford Coppola]], who had helped finance ''[[Clownhouse]]'' (1989), Salva's directorial debut. As a result of the successes of the 1999 films ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' and ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', Salva received four offers from interested studios within two days of him completing the script. Seven to eight months later, [[United Artists]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] acquired the distribution rights for $2.5 million.
