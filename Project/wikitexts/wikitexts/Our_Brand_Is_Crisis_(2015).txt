The film gives a fictionalized account of the involvement of American political campaign strategists [[Greenberg Carville Shrum]] (GCS) in the [[Bolivian presidential election, 2002|2002 Bolivian presidential election]]. The film stars [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Scoot McNairy]], [[Billy Bob Thornton]], [[Anthony Mackie]], [[Ann Dowd]] and [[Joaquim de Almeida]].\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on September 29, 2014, in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. [[George Clooney]] and [[Grant Heslov]] produced. The film was screened in the Special Presentations section of the [[2015 Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"variety\">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/sandra-bullocks-our-brand-tom-hiddlestons-i-saw-the-light-to-premiere-at-toronto-1201572271/ |title=Sandra Bullock's 'Our Brand Is Crisis,' Robert Redford's 'Truth' to Premiere at Toronto |access-date=18 August 2015 |work=Variety}}</ref> It was theatrically released by [[Warner Bros.]] on October 30, 2015. It received mixed reviews, despite Bullock's performance being largely praised, and was a [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2002, Bolivian politician Pedro Castillo hires an American political consulting firm (based on [[James Carville]]'s [[Greenberg Carville Shrum]] firm) to help him win the [[Bolivian presidential election, 2002|2002 Bolivian presidential election]]. The firm brings in \"Calamity\" Jane Bodine to manage Castillo's fledging campaign. The opposition's top political consultant is her nemesis, fellow American Pat Candy. In Bolivia, the situation is tense: Bodine learns that the indigenous people, who are a majority in the country but lack any real political power, are protesting for constitutional reform to get proper representation.\n\nThe American consultants, not knowing the language or the culture of Bolivia, are persuaded by Bodine, a burned out veteran of American politics, to follow a strategy of smear campaigning to make up for their candidate's shortcomings. However, Castillo refuses to give permission for the team to do so. It is only after Bodine arranges for the distribution of a flyer accusing Castillo of a long-ago affair (and blaming it on the opposition) does she finally get him to agree to smear his opponents.\n\nIn the following months, the team exercises a strategy of \"declaring a crisis\". They plan to frighten the people, with the aim of persuading them to vote for the unsympathetic but known Castillo rather than the younger opposition candidates. They even resort to publishing photos of their enemy with [[Nazi]] war criminal [[Klaus Barbie]] in the background, so that he has to deny being a Nazi. Castillo's bus is stopped by a group of protesters who don't want the [[International Monetary Fund]] in Bolivia. Castillo promises them that he will not invite the IMF without a public referendum. Eduardo, a young volunteer of the Castillo campaign, is deeply impressed by this show of commitment. His loyalty comes mostly from the fact that Castillo, who was president at the time, took a young Eduardo on his arm during a rally in his town. Nevertheless, his brothers are much more skeptical about Castillo.\n\nDuring the final debate, Bodine cites a quote in a conversation with Candy (knowing that he'll give it to rival candidate Rivera for his speech) saying that \"a great man\" said it. Unfortunately, the quote is actually from [[Joseph Goebbels]], [[Adolf Hitler]]'s minister of propaganda. Castillo wins the vote by a small margin. As one of his first actions, he invites the IMF into Bolivia, thereby breaking his promise. The deeply disappointed Eduardo visits Bodine in her hotel; Bodine replies that she is not responsible for Castillo's actions. In her eyes, her job is done.\n\nThe disillusioned Eduardo joins his brothers at a demonstration of people demanding change. The police arrive and the demonstration quickly turns into a riot. Bodine and her crew join Candy on the way to the airport. All of them, except Bodine, have already taken jobs as political consultants in other countries. When Bodine realizes that she brought a liar into office, she has the car stopped and leaves to join Eduardo.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as 'Calamity' Jane Bodine,<ref name=\"Bullock\" /> a
