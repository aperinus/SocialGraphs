Written by [[Frank Butler (writer)|Frank Butler]] and Frank Cavett based on a story by McCarey, the film is about a new young priest taking over a parish from an established old veteran. Crosby sings five songs<ref name=\"imdb\">Going My Way</ref> with other songs performed onscreen by [[Metropolitan Opera]]'s star [[mezzo-soprano]] [[Ris\u00eb Stevens]] and the [[Robert Mitchell (organist)#Robert Mitchell Boys Choir|Robert Mitchell Boys Choir]]. ''Going My Way'' was followed the next year by a sequel, ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]''.\n\n''Going My Way'' was the [[1944 in film|highest-grossing picture]] of 1944, and was nominated for ten [[Academy Awards]], winning seven, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].<ref name=\"imdbawards\"/> Its success helped to make movie exhibitors choose Crosby as the biggest box-office draw of the year,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/111407%7C111408/Bing-Crosby-Profile.html|title=Bing Crosby Profile|work=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref><ref name=pc1b>{{Pop Chronicles 40s|1|B |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1633239/m1/#track/2 }}</ref> a record he would hold for the remainder of the 1940s. After World War II, Crosby and McCarey presented a copy of the film to Pope [[Pius XII]] at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].\n\n==Plot==\nFather Charles \"Chuck\" O'Malley  ([[Bing Crosby]]), an incoming priest from [[East St. Louis]], is transferred to St. Dominic's Church in [[New York City]].\n\nOn his first day, his unconventional style gets him into a series of mishaps; his informal appearance and attitude make a poor impression with the elder pastor, Father Fitzgibbon ([[Barry Fitzgerald]]). The very traditional Fitzgibbon is further put off by O'Malley's recreational habits&nbsp;\u2013 particularly his golf-playing&nbsp;\u2013 and his friendship with the even more casual Father Timmy O'Dowd ([[Frank McHugh]]). O'Malley privately informs O'Dowd that he was sent by the bishop to take charge of the affairs of the parish, but that Fitzgibbon is to remain as pastor. To spare Fitzgibbon's feelings, O'Malley acts as if he is simply an assistant.\n\nThe difference between O'Malley and Fitzgibbon's styles is openly apparent as they deal with events like a parishioner being evicted and a young woman named Carol James ([[Jean Heather]]) having run away from home. The most consequential difference arises in their handling of the youth of the church, many of whom are consistently getting into trouble with the law in a gang led by Tony Scaponi ([[Stanley Clements]]). Fitzgibbon is inclined to look the other way, siding with the boys because of their frequent church attendance. O'Malley seeks to make inroads into the boys' lives, befriending Scaponi and eventually convincing the boys to become a church choir.\n\nThe noise of the practicing choir annoys Fitzgibbon, who goes to the bishop and asks for O'Malley to be transferred away. In the course of the conversation, Fitzgibbon infers the bishop's intention to put O'Malley in charge of the parish. To avoid an uncomfortable situation, Fitzgibbon asks the bishop to put O'Malley in charge, and then, resigned to his fate, he informs O'Malley of his new role.  A distressed Fitzgibbon runs away in a rainstorm, returning late that night. O'Malley puts the older priest to bed, and the two begin to bond. They discuss Fitzgibbon's long-put-off desire to go to [[Ireland]] and see his mother, now over 90 years old. O'Malley puts Fitzgibbon to sleep with an Irish lullaby, \"[[Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral]]\".\n\nO'Malley runs into Jenny Tuffel ([[Ris\u00eb Stevens]]), an old girlfriend whom he left to join the priesthood. Jenny now has a successful career with the [[Metropolitan Opera]], performing under the stage name Genevieve Linden. As she prepares to go onstage as the lead in a performance of ''[[Carmen]]'', the two discuss their past, and she learns that her world travels with a previous opera company caused her to miss his letter explaining he had entered the priesthood.\n\nO'Malley next pays a visit to Carol, who is now suspected of living in sin with Ted Haines Jr. ([[James Brown (actor)|James Brown]]), the son of the church's mortgage-holder. O'Malley describes to the young couple his calling in life to \"go his way,\" which to him means to follow the joyous side of religion and lead others to do the same. He sings them the song \"Going My Way,\" which he wrote on this theme.  When the junior Haines is confronted by his father, the father discovers that he and Carol have married, and he has joined the Air Force.\n\nJenny visits O'Malley at the church, sees the boys' choir, and reads the sheet music of \"Going My Way\". She, O'Malley, and O'Dowd devise a plan to rent out the Metropolitan, have the choir perform it with a full orchestra, then sell the rights to the song, saving the church from its financial woes. When Max Dolan ([[William Frawley]]), the music executive brought on to hear the song does not believe it will sell, the choir decides to make the most of its opportunity on the grand stage, and sings \"[[Swinging on a Star]]\". The executive overhears and decides to buy it, providing enough money to pay off the church mortgage.\n\nWith everything settled, O'Malley is transferred to a new assignment; O'Dowd will be Fitzgibbon's new assistant, with Tony Scaponi in charge of the choir. However, the church is damaged in a massive fire. On Christmas Eve, parishioners gather in a temporary church for a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] that also serves as O'Malley's farewell. As a going-away present, O'Malley has sent for Fitzgibbon's mother ([[Adeline De Walt Reynolds]]) from Ireland. As mother and son embrace for the first time in 45 years, the choir sings \"Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral\", as Father O'Malley quietly slips away into the night.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Per opening credits, in order, which ends onscreen with Ris\u00eb Stevens -->\n{{div col|colwidth=32em}}\n* [[Bing Crosby]] as Father Chuck O'Malley\n* [[Barry Fitzgerald]] as Father Fitzgibbon\n* [[Frank McHugh]] as Father Timothy O'Dowd\n* [[James Brown (actor)|James Brown]] as Ted Haines Jr.\n* [[Gene Lockhart]] as Ted Haines Sr.\n* [[Jean Heather]] as Carol James\n* [[Porter Hall]] as Mr. Belknap\n* [[Fortunio Bonanova]] as Tomaso Bozanni\n* [[Eily Malyon]] as Mrs. Carmody\n* [[Robert Mitchell (organist)#Robert Mitchell Boys Choir|Robert Mitchell Boychoir]] as St. Dominic's Church Choir <!-- spelling of Boychoir per credits -->\n* [[Ris\u00eb Stevens]] as Genevieve Linden/Jenny Tuffel (credited as Famous Contralto of Metropolitan Opera Association)\n\n'''Uncredited cast'''\n* [[Stanley Clements]] as Tony Scaponi\n* [[William Frawley]] as Max Dolan\n* [[Carl Switzer|Carl \"Alfalfa\" Switzer]] as Herman Langer<ref name=\"imdbcast\">{{cite web |title=Full cast and crew for ''Going My Way'' |publisher=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036872/fullcredits |access-date=August 4, 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Adeline De Walt Reynolds]] as Father Fitzgibbon's mother, Mrs. Molly Fitzgibbon <ref>{{Cite web |title=Adeline De Walt Reynolds |publisher=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0212339/ |access-date=March 17, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Anita Sharp-Bolster]] as Mrs. Quimp\n* [[Jack Norton]] as Mr. Lilley, Music Publisher \n* [[William Henry (actor)|William \"Bill\" Henry]] as Doctor\n* [[Martin Garralaga]] as Zuniga\n* [[Julie Gibson]] as Taxi driver\n* [[Gibson Gowland]] as Churchgoer<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Fred|title=Road to Hollywood|date=1986|publisher=John Joyce|location=Gateshead|page=138}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\nRis\u00eb Stevens, whose character is seen onscreen performing the lead role in a Metropolitan Opera (the Met) production of ''Carmen'', was an actual performer with the Met when the film was made.
