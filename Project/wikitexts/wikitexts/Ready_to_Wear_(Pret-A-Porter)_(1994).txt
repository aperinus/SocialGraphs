Early on, Fashion Council head Olivier de la Fontaine chokes to death on a sandwich, leaving behind a wife, a mistress, and a mysterious Russian companion who has fled the scene.\n\nAs the death is being investigated, Fashion Week continues. Injecting herself between the designers, American television personality Kitty gets sound bites from the high-fashion types throughout the length of the show.\n\nMeanwhile, Anne and Joe are two American journalists, thrown together into the same over-booked room. They are meant to cover the show for their respective papers, but skip out on the majority of the festivities to have a hotel-room tryst during the week.\n\nThree rival magazine editors from ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', ''[[British Vogue|British Vogue]]'' and ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' vie for the exclusive services of Milo O'Brannigan, a trendy photographer who sexually humiliates the three; leading them to vow vengeance against him.\n\nSergei, a fading icon (and the mysterious Russian with Olivier when he died) and Isabella (Olivier's widow) hope to rekindle a romance from decades ago, but as they attempt to be intimate, Sergei falls asleep.\n\nIn the end, Fontaine's former mistress Simone sends her models down the catwalk nude in protest of her son Jack's (who incidentally had been cheating on his model girlfriend with another model) sale of her brand. Kitty quits on the spot, as the nudity confuses her. And the final scene is of Olivier de la Fontaine's funeral procession, after the police declared him dead from choking on a sandwich.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Marcello Mastroianni]] as Sergei/Sergio\n* [[Sophia Loren]] as Isabella de la Fontaine\n* [[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]] as Simone Lowenthal\n* [[Rupert Everett]] as Jack Lowenthal\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Anne Eisenhower\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Joe Flynn\n* [[Kim Basinger]] as Kitty Potter\n* [[Stephen Rea]] as Milo O'Brannigan\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Cy Bianco\n* [[Richard E.
