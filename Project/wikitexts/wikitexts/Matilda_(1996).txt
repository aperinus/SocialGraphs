Based on [[Roald Dahl]]'s popular 1988 [[Matilda (novel)|novel of the same name]], the film stars [[Mara Wilson]] as the [[Matilda Wormwood|title character]] with DeVito (who also served a dual role as the narrator), [[Rhea Perlman]], [[Embeth Davidtz]] and [[Pam Ferris]] in supporting roles. The film centers on the titular [[child prodigy]], Matilda Wormwood, who develops [[psychokinesis|psychokinetic abilities]] and uses them to deal with her disreputable family; and [[Miss Trunchbull]], the ruthless, oppressive, and tyrannical principal of Crunchem Hall Elementary School.\n\nProduced by DeVito's Jersey Films, the film was released theatrically in the United States on August 2, 1996, by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]] through [[TriStar Pictures]] label. The film received positive reviews, praising DeVito's direction, and the film's faithfulness to the spirit of the source material. However, the film was commercially unsuccessful, grossing $33.5 million in the United States on a $36 million budget.<ref name=\"gross\"/>\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\nYoung genius [[Matilda Wormwood]] is neglected and mistreated by her car dealer father Harry and mother Zinnia, and her older brother, Michael. She is smart and independent, and finds solace in the fictional worlds of books at the public library. When Matilda's parents refuse to enroll her into school, she puts [[hydrogen peroxide|bleach]] in her father's [[Hair conditioner|hair tonic]] and glues his hat to his head. Harry catches Matilda reading ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', rips it up, and forces her to watch [[game show]]s on television. Matilda becomes increasingly enraged until the television explodes.\n\nHarry sells a car to Miss Agatha Trunchbull, the tyrannical principal of Crunchem Hall Elementary School, in exchange for admitting Matilda as a student. Matilda's teacher, Miss Jennifer Honey, notices the ease with which Matilda answers middle school multiplication questions and requests Matilda be moved to a higher class, but Trunchbull refuses. The Wormwoods are not interested either. Trunchbull has the whole school watch her forcing pupil Bruce Bogtrotter to eat an entire enormous [[chocolate cake]]. Matilda leads the students in cheering Bruce to success, and Trunchbull gives them all five hours detention. Matilda discovers her father is under surveillance by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] over his illegal dealings. Her parents refuse to believe her as Zinnia flirts with the two agents whom she believes are speedboat salesmen.\n\nMatilda's friend Lavender puts a [[newt]] in Trunchbull's water jug. Trunchbull accuses Matilda, who, in anger at the injustice, [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]] tips the glass over, splashing the newt onto Trunchbull. Matilda is unable to reproduce her powers to Honey during a test. Honey invites Matilda to tea and reveals a secret: her mother died when she was two, and her father Magnus invited his wife's stepsister, Trunchbull, to live with them and look after her, but Trunchbull abused her. Magnus died, apparently by suicide, when Honey was five and left everything to Trunchbull who Honey suspects killed him. Matilda and Honey sneak into Trunchbull's house to retrieve some of Honey's belongings. They narrowly escape when Trunchbull unexpectedly returns.\n\nMatilda practices her telekinetic powers and thwarts the FBI agents to buy Harry time to come to his senses. She returns to Trunchbull's house and attempts to scare her out of it but Trunchbull becomes aware of Matilda's presence upon finding her hair ribbon. The next day, Matilda reveals her powers to Honey but Trunchbull visits the class to make Matilda confess. Matilda telekinetically writes a message on the blackboard, posing as the vengeful soul of Magnus accusing Trunchbull of murdering him. Trunchbull attacks the students in a rage, but Matilda protects them and they force Trunchbull out of the school. Honey moves back into her house.\n\nHarry, Zinnia, and Michael come to Honey's house to collect Matilda and flee to [[Guam]] to avoid the FBI. Matilda refuses to go, saying she would rather be adopted by Honey. Her parents sign the adoption papers and Matilda lives happily with Honey, who becomes principal of Crunchem Hall.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Mara Wilson]] as [[Matilda Wormwood]]; a young, savvy, well-mannered, intelligent 6-year-old girl whose powers can make anything possible.\n**Alissa and Amanda Graham/James and Trevor Gallagher as Newborn Matilda Wormwood\n**Kayla and Kelsey Fredericks as 9-month-old Matilda Wormwood\n**Amanda and Caitlin Fein as Toddler Matilda Wormwood\n**Sara Magdalin as 4-year-old Matilda Wormwood\n*[[Embeth Davidtz]] as Miss Jennifer Honey; the kind and devoted teacher at Crunchem Hall who inspires Matilda to believe in the power of what is inside.\n**Amanda and Kristin Summers as 2-year-old Miss Jennifer Honey\n**Phoebe Pearl as 5-year-old Miss Jennifer Honey\n*[[Pam Ferris]] as [[Miss Trunchbull|Miss Agatha Trunchbull]]; Jennifer Honey's abusive aunt and also the cruel, and selfish principal at Crunchem Hall; she is a former Olympian athlete, and uses her strengths - [[shot put]], [[hammer throw]], and [[javelin]] - to hurt the children at the school.

The climactic scene where she is whacked by [[blackboard]] rubbers required her to keep her eyes open, causing [[chalk]] dust to get caught in her eyes and necessitating several trips to the hospital to get her eyes washed out.<ref name=\":0\" /> The scene where Trunchbull whirls Amanda Thripp (Jacqueline Steiger) by her pigtails required a harness to support the little girl, the wires of which were threaded through the pigtails and then looped around Ferris's fingertips to give her grip.
