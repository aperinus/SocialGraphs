[[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]] reprises the title role from the stage version, starring alongside [[Shirley Jones]], [[Buddy Hackett]], [[Hermione Gingold]], [[Ron Howard]], and [[Paul Ford]].\n\nReleased by [[Warner Bros.]] on June 19, 1962, the film was one of the [[1962 in film#Top-grossing films (U.S.)|biggest hits of the year]] and was widely acclaimed by critics. It was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], with composer [[Ray Heindorf]] winning [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music, Scoring of Music, Adaptation or Treatment]]. The film also won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]], and Preston and Jones were both nominated in their respective acting categories.  In 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"registry\">[https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/ \"registry\"], loc.gov, accessed October 24, 2016</ref>\n\n==Plot== <!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn 1912, notorious con man Professor Harold Hill arrives in River City, [[Iowa]], anxious to swindle the famously stubborn citizens. Masquerading as a band instructor, Hill\u2019s plan is to convince the townspeople into paying him to create a boys marching band. Once he collects payment for instruments and uniforms he will take the next train out of town.\n\nWith his associate, Marcellus Washburn, Hill realizes he needs a [[red herring]] ploy, so he incites concern among River City's parents that their boys are being seduced into sin and vice by the town's new [[pool table]]. He convinces them that a [[marching band]] is the only way to keep boys out of trouble, and begins collecting money for the band. Anticipating that Marian Paroo, the town's conscientious [[librarian]] and [[piano instructor]], will attempt to discredit him, Hill sets out to seduce her into silence. Also in opposition to Hill is the town's Mayor Shinn, owner of the [[billiard parlor]], who orders the [[school board]] to obtain Hill's credentials. When they attempt to do so, Hill avoids their questions by teaching them to sing as a [[barbershop quartet]] via \"sustained talking\". Thereafter, Hill easily tricks them into breaking into [[four-part harmony]] whenever they ask for his credentials.\n\nHill's wooing of Marian, who distrusts him, has little effect, though he succeeds in winning the admiration of her mother Widow Paroo and attempts to befriend her unhappy younger brother, Winthrop. When Marian discovers that Hill's claim to being a graduate of \"Gary Conservatory, Gold Medal, Class of '05\" is a lie (the town of [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]] was founded in 1906, so there could be no [[music conservatory]] with that name before that date), she attempts to expose him, but is interrupted by the arrival of the [[Wells Fargo]] wagon. When Winthrop, after years of moody withdrawal, joins in the townspeople's singing and speaks effusively about his new [[cornet]], Marian sees Hill's work as beneficial and hides the evidence of his deceit from Mayor Shinn. Hill tells the boys to learn to play via the \"Think System\", in which they simply have to think of a tune over and over and will know how to play it without ever practicing on their instruments.\n\nHill's con is nearly complete: all he has to do is collect the rest of the money and disappear. Meeting Marian at the traditional [[footbridge]] \u2013 the first time she has ever been there with a man \u2013 he learns that she knew of his deception but did not tell because she is in love with him. He is about to leave town when Charlie Cowell, a disgruntled [[anvil]] salesman who was run out of [[Brighton, Illinois]] because Hill had conned the townspeople there, comes to River City and exposes Hill. Sought by an angry mob and pressed to leave town by Marcellus and Marian, Hill realizes he is in love with Marian and does not want to leave her.\n\nHill is captured by the mob and brought before a town meeting to be [[tarred and feathered]]. Marian defends Hill; the townspeople, reminded of how he has brought so many of them together, elect to relent. Mayor Shinn reminds the townspeople how much money Hill has taken, with no apparent result. When he demands to know \"Where's the band?\" Hill is saved by the town's boys, who play [[Beethoven]]'s [[Minuet in G (Beethoven)|Minuet in G]] presumably via the \"Think System.\" Although their technical expertise leaves much to be desired, the boys' parents are enthralled. As the boys march out of the town hall, they are suddenly transformed in the townspeople's imagination into a spectacular marching band in resplendent uniforms, playing and marching with perfection, led by Hill. Hill is reunited with Marian, and all the other main characters join in during the credits.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]] as Harold Hill \n* [[Shirley Jones]] as Marian Paroo\n* [[Buddy Hackett]] as Marcellus Washburn\n* [[Hermione Gingold]] as Eulalie Mackechnie Shinn\n* [[Paul Ford]] as Mayor George Shinn\n* [[Pert Kelton]] as Mrs. Paroo\n* [[The Buffalo Bills (quartet)|The Buffalo Bills]] as The School Board:\n** Bill Spangenberg as Olin Britt\n** Wayne \"Scotty\" Ward as Oliver Hix\n** Al Shea as Ewart Dunlop\n** Vern Reed as Jacey Squires\n* [[Timmy Everett]] as Tommy Djilas\n* [[Susan Luckey]] as Zaneeta Shinn\n* [[Ron Howard]] as Winthrop Paroo\n* [[Harry Hickox]] as Charlie Cowell, the anvil salesman\n* [[Charles Lane (actor)|Charles Lane]] as Constable Locke\n* The Pick-a-Little Ladies:\n** [[Mary Wickes]] as Mrs. Squires\n** Peggy Mondo as Ethel Toffelmier\n** [[Sara Seegar]] as Mrs. Maud Dunlop\n** Adnia Rice as Alma Hix\n* [[Jesslyn Fax]] as Avis Grubb\n* Monique Vermont as Amaryllis \n* [[Ronnie Dapo]] as Norbert Smith (uncredited)\n* [[Percy Helton]] as Train Conductor (uncredited)\n* [[Max Showalter]] as Salesman on the Train (uncredited)\n}}\n\n=== Casting notes ===\nThe members of the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] cast who appear in the film are [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]] (Harold Hill), [[Pert Kelton]] (Mrs. Paroo), The Buffalo Bills (The School Board), Peggy Mondo (Ethel Toffelmier), and Adina Rice (Alma Hix).

[[James Cagney]] and [[Bing Crosby]]<ref name=\"Traubner\">Traubner, Richard. \"The Music Man,\" ''Playbill'' (1988).</ref> were offered the role of Harold Hill, but both turned it down.

Marian sings the song in B major.\n\nIt is revealed that \"Harold Hill\" is an alias used by the salesman while in River City. Early in the film, Hill runs into an old friend and crony Marcellus where the latter now works in the livery stable.

Warner selected the [[University of Southern California]]'s marching band, the [[Spirit of Troy]]. Many junior high school students from Southern California were also included, forming the majority of the band. It took approximately eight hours of shooting over two days to film the scene. All the musical instruments for the production were specially made for the film by the Olds Instrument Company in [[Fullerton, California]]. The instruments were then refurbished and sold by Olds with no indication they were ever used in the film.\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its premiere in [[Mason City, Iowa]], the home town of Meredith Willson, during the North Iowa Band Festival on June 19, 1962.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|page=1|title=WB Expends 175G Overturing 'Music'|date=June 20, 1962}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:The Music Man (1962 film poster).jpg|thumb|Alternate theatrical release poster]]\n\nThe film received positive reviews and grossed $14,953,846 at the box office,<ref name=\"numbers\"/> earning $8.1 million in US [[Gross rental|theatrical rentals]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080907071824/http://www.boxofficereport.com/database/1962.shtml Top 20 Films of 1962 by Domestic Revenue]</ref> It was the [[1962 in film|3rd highest-grossing film of 1962]].\n\n[[Bosley Crowther]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote \"It's here, and the rich, ripe roundness of it, the lush amalgam of the many elements of successful American show business that Mr. Willson brought together on the stage, has been preserved and appropriately made rounder and richer through the magnitude of film.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|authorlink=Bosley Crowther|url=http://www.mrqe.com/external_review?review=363258795|title=Screen: Preston Stars in 'Music Man':Film Version of Stage Comedy Opens Here|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|via=mrqe.com|date=August 24, 1962}}</ref>\n\nRobert Landry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote: \"Call this a triumph, perhaps a classic, of corn, smalltown nostalgia and American love of a parade...DaCosta\u2019s use of several of the original Broadway cast players is thoroughly vindicated...But the only choice for the title role, Robert Preston, is the big proof of showmanship in the casting.
