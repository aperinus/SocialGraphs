Kevin Van Hentenryck stars as a normal-looking person who seeks vengeance for the unwanted surgery that separated him from his deformed [[conjoined twin]] brother, who he now hides in a basket.\n\nThe film gained an audience in the 1980s due to the advent of [[home video]] and has been considered a [[cult film]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/14/nyregion/era-ends-as-times-square-drops-slashers-for-shakespeare.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|title=Era Ends as Times Square Drops Slashers for Shakespeare|last=Tierney|first=John|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1991-01-14|access-date=2014-01-29}}</ref> The film spawned two sequels, ''[[Basket Case 2]]'' (1990) and ''[[Basket Case 3: The Progeny]]'' (1991), which were also directed by Henenlotter.\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Julius Lifflander is frightened by something outside his forest home. A shadowed creature then cuts his phone line and power before killing Lifflander by tearing at his face.\n\nDuane Bradley arrives in [[New York City]] with a locked wicker basket. He gets a room at a cheap hotel right down the hall from a [[sex worker]] named Casey. He takes some hamburgers and feeds them to a creature in his basket which talks to him telepathically. When Duane is out the next day a man named Brian O'Donovan looks through Duane's keyhole in order to steal Duane's wad of money. Casey scares him off and informs Duane about it. Duane takes his basket to see Dr. Harold Needleman and befriends his assistant Sharon. Needleman contacts Dr. Judith Kutter and tells her about Duane's visit and Lifflander's death, but she ignores him. Duane goes back to Needleman's that night and empties the creature, who is revealed to be his twin brother Belial, onto the floor. Belial kills Needleman by gutting him with his claws.\n\nThe next day, Duane goes to meet Sharon at the [[Statue of Liberty]] and they kiss. Belial senses this and trashes the hotel room in a temper tantrum. He hides when the hotel manager opens the door to see what the commotion is. O'Donovan sneaks back inside to steal Duane's money but is killed by Belial when he opens the basket. Duane senses the attack telepathically and hurries back. Duane tells Belial that he deserves some time for himself. Duane, with the basket, run into Casey at a bar and drunkenly tells her that Belial is his twin brother. \n\nA flashback relates their backstory. They were [[conjoined]] at birth and their aunt was the only one who would take care of them. However, the twins were surgically separated at an early age by Dr. Lifflander, Dr. Needleman and Dr. Kutter, which explains their hatred for the doctors. They then murdered their father, which was ruled an accident, and lived with their aunt before she died. They then went to murder the doctors who had separated them. Belial deeply resents being cut off from his normal-looking brother, and Duane equally resents how heartless everyone acts towards his brother.\n\nBack in the present day, Belial sneaks into Casey's bedroom and scares her out before stealing her panties. The next day, Duane and Belial go to Dr. Kutter's office. She tries to dismiss them, but Duane reveals who he is before Belial kills Kutter by shoving her face into a drawer of sharp objects. Sharon goes to Duane's apartment seeking safety after Needleman's death and they start to make love before a jealous Belial starts screaming and Duane is forced to toss Sharon outside.\n\nThat night Belial goes out to find Sharon while Duane has a dream that tells him about it. Belial sneaks into Sharon's apartment and tries to rape her. He attacks and kills her when she wakes up and screams.  Enraged at his brother for his actions, Duane takes Belial back to the apartment in a scene that attracts several people to his apartment, which exposes the existence of Belial. Belial attacks Duane which results in the two brothers falling from a hotel window. They are knocked out as everyone surrounds their unconscious bodies.\n\n==Cast==\n* Kevin Van Hentenryck as Duane Bradley\n* Terri Susan Smith as Sharon\n* Beverly Bonner as Casey\n* Robert Vogel as Hotel manager\n* Joe Clarke as Brian 'Mickey' O'Donovan\n* Lloyd Pace as Dr. Harold Needleman \n* Bill Freeman as Dr. Julius Lifflander \n* Diana Browne as Dr. Judith Kutter\n* Tom Tolan as Belial Bradley (uncredited)\n* [[Jerry Butler (actor)|Jerry Butler]] as Casey Greeter #1 (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nThe movie was shot on [[16 mm film]].

When Belial's hand is seen attacking his victims, it is really a glove worn by Henenlotter. The puppet is used in scenes with an actor and where the eyes glow red. The sequence for Belial's rampage used stop motion animation.<ref>\"In Search of Hotel Broslin\".
