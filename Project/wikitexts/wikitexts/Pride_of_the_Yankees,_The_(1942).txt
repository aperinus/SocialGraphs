It is a tribute to the legendary [[New York Yankees]] [[first baseman]] [[Lou Gehrig]], who died only one year before its release, at age 37, from [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], which later became known to the lay public as \"Lou Gehrig's disease\".\n\nThough subtitled '''''The Life of Lou Gehrig''''', the film is less a sports biography than an homage to a heroic and widely loved sports figure whose tragic and premature death touched the entire nation. It emphasizes Gehrig's relationship with his parents (particularly his strong-willed mother), his friendships with players and journalists, and his storybook romance with the woman who became his \"companion for life,\" [[Eleanor Gehrig|Eleanor Twitchell]]. Details of his baseball career\u2014which were still fresh in most fans' minds in 1942\u2014are limited to montages of ballparks, pennants, and Cooper swinging bats and running bases, though Gehrig's best-known major league record\u20142,130 consecutive games played\u2014is prominently cited.\n\nYankee teammates [[Babe Ruth]], [[Bob Meusel]], [[Mark Koenig]], and [[Bill Dickey]] play themselves, as does sportscaster [[Bill Stern]]. The film was adapted by [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]], [[Jo Swerling]], and an uncredited [[Casey Robinson]] from a story by [[Paul Gallico]], and received 11 [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations. It ends with a re-enactment of Gehrig's poignant 1939 farewell speech at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. The film's iconic closing line\u2014\"Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth\"\u2014was voted 38th on the [[American Film Institute]]'s list of [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|100 greatest movie quotes]].<ref name=\"imdb\">{{IMDb title|0035211|The Pride of the Yankees}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nLou Gehrig is a young [[Columbia University]] student whose old-fashioned mother wants him to study hard and become an engineer, but the young man has a gift for baseball. A sportswriter befriends Gehrig and persuades a scout to come see him play. When his mother gets sick, Gehrig signs with the team he has always revered, the [[New York Yankees]] to pay for the hospital bills. With the help of his father, he endeavors to keep his career change a secret from his mother.\n\nGehrig works his way up through the minor leagues and joins the Yankees. His hero, [[Babe Ruth]], is at first condescending and dismissive of the rookie, but his strong, consistent play wins over Ruth and the rest of the team. Gehrig is unknowingly included by his teammates in playing pranks on Ruth on the team train.\n\nDuring a game at [[Comiskey Park]], Gehrig trips over a stack of bats and is teased by a spectator, Eleanor (the daughter of the ballpark hot dog magnate), who laughingly calls him \"tanglefoot\". Later, they are properly introduced, leading to a relationship, and then an engagement. Gehrig's mother, who still has not accepted the fact that her son will not be an engineer, does not take this news well; Gehrig finally stands up to her, and marries Eleanor.\n\nThe Yankees become the most dominant team in baseball, and Gehrig becomes a fan favorite. His father and fully converted mother attend games and cheer for him. In a re-creation of a famous (and possibly apocryphal) story, Gehrig visits a crippled boy named Billy in a hospital. He promises to hit two home runs in a single [[World Series]] game in the boy's honor\u2014then fulfills his promise.\n\nGehrig is now the \"Iron Horse\", a national hero at the peak of his career with multitudes of fans, many loyal friends, and an adoring wife. Then he begins to notice, with growing alarm, that his strength is slowly ebbing away. Though he continues to play, and extends his consecutive-game streak to a seemingly insurmountable record, his physical condition continues its inexorable decline. One day, in Detroit, he tells Yankees manager [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joe McCarthy]] that he has become a detriment to the team and benches himself. After an examination, a doctor gives him the awful news: Gehrig has a rare, incurable disease, and only a short time to live.\n\nA short time later, at [[Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day|Lou Gehrig Day]] at Yankee Stadium, an older Billy finds Gehrig and shows him that he has made a full recovery, inspired by his hero's example and the two-homer fulfilled promise. Then, as Eleanor weeps softly in the stands, Gehrig addresses the fans: \"People all say that I've had a bad break. But today ... today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth.\"\n\n==Cast==\nAs per [[American Film Institute|AFI]] database:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=27411 | publisher=American Film Institute | title=The Pride of the Yankees | access-date=January 6, 2015}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Gary Cooper]] as [[Lou Gehrig]]\n* [[Teresa Wright]] as [[Eleanor Gehrig|Eleanor Twitchell Gehrig]]\n* [[Babe Ruth]] as Himself\n* [[Walter Brennan]] as Sam Blake\n* [[Dan Duryea]] as Hank Hanneman\n* Elsa Janssen as Mom Gehrig\n* [[Ludwig St\u00f6ssel]] as Pop Gehrig\n* [[Virginia Gilmore]] as Myra\n* [[Bill Dickey]] as Himself\n* [[Ernie Adams (actor)|Ernie Adams]] as [[Miller Huggins]]\n* [[Pierre Watkin]] as Mr. Twitchell\n* [[Harry Harvey Sr.|Harry Harvey]] as [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joe McCarthy]] \n* [[Bob Meusel|Robert W.

In addition, conventional Hollywood wisdom dictated that sports pictures were box-office poison, as women, who made up more than half the audience and made most movie-going decisions, did not like them. After Wood screened newsreel footage of Gehrig's famous \"luckiest man\" speech, however, Goldwyn\u2014with tears in his eyes\u2014agreed to produce the picture.<ref name = \"TCM\"/>\n\nIn a 1941 press campaign publicizing plans for the film, [[RKO Pictures]] announced a major talent hunt for Gehrig's portrayer, but Goldwyn and Wood reportedly never considered casting anyone but Cooper in the title role.<ref name = \"TCM\">[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/18600%7C0/The-Pride-of-the-Yankees.html ''The Pride of the Yankees'']. TCM.com, retrieved June 2, 2017.</ref> Although he was ideally suited to the part due to his physical resemblance to Gehrig and the quiet strength and masculine appeal that he projected, Cooper was reluctant to accept it because he, like Goldwyn, had no interest in baseball. By one account, he had never watched a game nor even swung a bat prior to taking the role.<ref name = \"Columbia\"/> Another problem was Cooper's age (41), particularly in scenes involving Gehrig as a young man. Cinematographer [[Rudolph Mat\u00e9]] lighted Cooper from below during those early scenes to conceal lines and wrinkles, then gradually reduced and finally eliminated the lighting effect as the story progressed.<ref name = \"TCM\"/>\n\nAnother important (and problematic) casting decision was Babe Ruth, as himself. Ruth's health had been declining steadily since his retirement in 1935, and by 1942 he weighed nearly 270 pounds. He was put on a strict diet to achieve a presentable weight before filming began. This rapid weight loss, on the heels of a [[heart attack]] followed by a [[car accident]], combined with the tough shooting schedule and Ruth's propensity to keep late hours, weakened him significantly. By the time filming wrapped he had developed [[pneumonia]] severe enough to require a period of hospitalization.<ref name = \"TCM\"/>\n\nMultiple published sources<ref>Meyers, Jeffrey: Gary Cooper, American Hero.
