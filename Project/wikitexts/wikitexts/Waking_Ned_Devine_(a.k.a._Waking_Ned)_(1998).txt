They obtain a list of lottery customers from Mrs. Kennedy (Maura O'Malley) at the post office and invite the potential winners to a chicken dinner, where they attempt to get the winner to reveal him- or herself. After everyone has left and they are no closer to an answer, Annie realizes that one person did not come to the dinner, so Jackie pays a late-night visit to the only absentee: the reclusive Ned Devine (Jimmy Keogh). He finds Ned in his home in front of the TV, still holding the ticket in his hand, a smile on his face and dead from shock. That same night, Jackie has a dream that the deceased Ned wants to share the winnings with his friends, as he has no family to claim the ticket. Jackie wakes up after the dream, and before dawn, he and Michael return to Ned's house to gather Ned's personal information so they can claim the winnings for themselves.\n\nElsewhere in the village, Maggie O'Toole ([[Susan Lynch]]) continues to spurn the romantic interests of her old flame, \"Pig\" Finn ([[James Nesbitt]]), a local pig farmer. Finn is convinced they belong together, as he thinks he is the father of her son Maurice (Robert Hickey), but she cannot abide him due to his ever-present odour of pigs. Finn has a rival in Pat Mulligan ([[Fintan McKeown]]), also hoping to marry Maggie.\n\nJackie and Michael call the National Lottery to make the claim, prompting a claim inspector to be sent. The inspector, Mr. Kelly, arrives to find Jackie on the beach and asks him for directions to Ned's cottage. Jackie delays Kelly by taking him on a circuitous route while Michael races to the cottage on a motorcycle, completely naked, and breaks in so he can answer the door as Ned. After discovering that the lottery winnings are far greater than they anticipated (totaling nearly [[Irish Pound|IR\u00a3]]7 million), Jackie and Michael are forced to involve the entire village in fooling Mr. Kelly. All the villagers sign their name to a pact to participate in the ruse, except one\u2014the local curmudgeon, Lizzie Quinn (Eileen Dromey). She threatens to report the fraud in order to receive a ten-percent reward, and attempts to blackmail Jackie for \u00a31 million of the winnings. Jackie does not refuse her outright, but later insists to Michael, \"She'll sign for the same as us, or get nothing at all!\"\n\nThe villagers go to great lengths to fool the inspector, even pretending Ned's funeral is a service for Michael when the inspector wanders into the church. The inspector leaves, satisfied that the claim is legitimate, and the villagers celebrate their winnings at the local pub. Meanwhile, Lizzie makes her way to the nearest working phone, a [[phone box]] outside the village on the edge of a cliff, and phones the lottery office. Before she can report the fraud, however, the departing claim inspector sneezes while driving past her and loses control of his car, forcing an oncoming van (driven by Tullymore's village priest, returning from a sabbatical) to crash into the phone box, sending it plummeting off the cliff and crashing to the ground below with Lizzie still inside.\n\nAt the celebration, Jackie spots Maggie, who is content to marry Finn now that he has the money to give up pig farming. Maggie confides in him that Ned is Maurice's real father, meaning that Maurice is technically entitled to the entire winnings. Jackie urges her to claim the fortune for Maurice, but she demurs, determined to keep the secret so that Maurice will have a father and the villagers will have their money.\n\nFinally, Jackie, Michael, Maurice, and several other villagers stand on a headland and raise their glasses to Ned, toasting him for his gift to the village.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Ian Bannen]] as Jackie O'Shea\n*[[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] as Michael O'Sullivan\n*[[Fionnula Flanagan]] as Annie O'Shea\n*[[Susan Lynch]] as Maggie O'Toole\n*[[James Nesbitt]] as Pig Finn\n*Adrian Robinson as Lotto Observer\n*Maura O'Malley as Mrs. Kennedy\n*Robert Hickey as Maurice O'Toole\n*Paddy Ward as Brendy O'Toole\n*James Ryland as Dennis Fitzgerald\n*[[Fintan McKeown]] as Pat Mulligan\n*Eileen Dromey as Lizzy Quinn\n*Kitty Fitzgerald as Kitty\n*Dermot Kerrigan as Father Patrick\n*Jimmy Keogh as Ned Devine\n*[[Paul Vaughan]] as Narrator\n}}\n\n*Jill Foster as car hire lady\n\n==Production==\nJones originally developed the idea for ''Waking Ned'' as a roughly 10-minute short film, but later expanded the work into a full-length script.
