A [[French Canadian]] model's separated [[conjoined twin]] is suspected of having committed a brutal murder witnessed by a newspaper reporter in [[Staten Island]], [[New York City]].\n\nCo-written by De Palma and Louisa Rose, the screenplay for the film was inspired by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] conjoined twins [[Masha and Dasha Krivoshlyapova]] and features narrative and visual references to several films by [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>{{cite web| url= https://avclub.com/articles/unamerican-psycho-brian-de-palma-and-the-political,83700/|work=The AV Club|title=Un-American Psycho: Brian De Palma And The Political Invisible |author=Semley, John|date=August 13, 2012|access-date=July 30, 2018}}</ref> Filmed on location in Staten Island, the film prominently features [[Split screen (video production)|split-screen]] compositions (also present in subsequent De Palma films such as ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]''), and was scored by frequent Hitchcock collaborator [[Bernard Herrmann]].\n\nReleased in the spring of 1973, ''Sisters'' received praise from critics who noted its adept performances and use of [[homage (arts)|homage]]. It marked the first thriller for De Palma, who followed it with other shocking, graphic thrillers, and went on to become a [[cult following|cult film]] in the years after its release.<ref name=afi/>\n\n== Plot ==\nAdvertising salesman Philip Woode wins dinner for two at a [[Manhattan]] restaurant on a ''[[Candid Camera]]''-style television show. When she flirts with him, he agrees to take Danielle Breton, a young French Canadian model and aspiring actress who was part of the prank, as his date. After dinner, they retire to her apartment to have sex. The next morning, Danielle tells Philip that Dominique, her twin sister, has come to celebrate their birthday. At her request, he goes to the drug store to refill a prescription and picks up a birthday cake at a bakery on his way back. When he returns, he is stabbed to death by the crazed Dominique. Before he dies, he tries to alert a neighbor by writing \"help\" in his own blood on a window.\n\nThe neighbor, a reporter named Grace Collier, calls the police. Danielle's ex-husband Emil helps her clean up and hide Philip's body by folding it inside the sofabed. Grace accompanies the skeptical Detective Kelly and his partner on a search of Danielle's apartment, but Danielle insists that she has been alone since last night.\n\nCertain that Danielle is hiding the murderer, Grace persuades her editor to let her investigate the story on the basis that the police are ignoring her because Philip was black. She hires Larch, a private investigator, to gain access to the apartment. He determines that the couch contains the body. He also finds a thick file from the Loisel Institute on the Blanchion Twins, Canada's first [[conjoined twins]]. Grace's further investigations uncover that the twins were separated only recently, and that Dominique apparently died during the operation.\n\nAs Larch pursues the truck that Emil called to haul the couch away, Grace tails Emil and Danielle to a mental hospital. When she is caught, Emil convinces the staff that she is a new patient. He sedates and promises to reveal everything, placing Danielle on the bed beside her. Grace has a bizarre dream about the twins' past and their separation, in which she herself is Dominique. Emil tells Danielle that the separation was necessary to save Danielle from the violent Dominique, who died during the surgery. Whenever she has a sexual experience, Danielle now dissociates to a violent \"Dominique\" personality. Emil kisses Danielle passionately to bring forth \"Dominique,\" but she slashes him in the groin with a scalpel, and he bleeds to death. Grace awakens to find the sorrowful Danielle tenderly embracing Emil's bloody body and screams in horror. Detective Kelly arrests Danielle, who denies knowledge of the murders and says that her sister is dead.\n\nKelly interviews Grace, who is still under Emil's hypnotic spell, repeating lines that he fed her to deny there was a murder. Larch tracks the sofa to a remote train station in Canada.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Margot Kidder]] as Danielle Breton / Dominique Blanchion\n* [[Jennifer Salt]] as Grace Collier\n* [[William Finley (actor)|William Finley]] as Emil Breton\n* [[Charles Durning]] as Joseph Larch\n* [[Lisle Wilson]] as Phillip Woode\n* [[Barnard Hughes]] as Arthur McLennen\n* Mary Davenport as Mrs. Peyson Collier\n* [[Dolph Sweet]] as Detective Kelly\n* [[Olympia Dukakis]] as Louise Wilanski (uncredited)\n* Catherine Gaffigan as Arlene \n* [[Justine Johnston]] as Elaine D'Anna \n* James Mapes as Guard \n* Burt Richards as Hospital Attendant \n* Bill Durks as a Sanitorium resident\n\n== Analysis ==\nScholarly discussion of ''Sisters'' has centered largely on its prevalent theme of [[voyeurism]] as well as a perceived commentary on the [[women's liberation movement]].{{sfn|Wood|2003|pages=134\u2013136}} Film critic and scholar [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] wrote that the film \"analyzes the ways in which women are oppressed within patriarchy society on two levels, the professional (Grace) and the psychosexual (Danielle/Dominique).\"{{sfn|Wood|2003|p=134}} He adds: \"If the monster is defined as that which threatens normality, it follows that the monster of ''Sisters'' is Grace as well as Danielle/Dominique{{en dash}}a point the film acknowledges in a cinematic hallucination/flashback sequence wherein Grace becomes Dominique...&nbsp; Simply, one can define the monster of ''Sisters'' as women's liberation.\"{{sfn|Wood|2003|p=134}}\n\nThe prominent allusions to works by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] have also been noted by critics such as Bruce Kawin, who wrote in 2000: {{blockquote|''Sisters''...&nbsp;  makes intelligent reference to ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948), ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), and even ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920). The film ends with a shot of a detective looking through binoculars at what might be called the scene of the crime, intently but fruitlessly watching a couch that no one will ever incriminate themselves with by picking up. From start to finish, ''Sisters'' is charged with scenes of looking\u2014from seeing a murder through a window to seeing another person's memories in one's own mind.<ref name=kawin/>}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nDe Palma was inspired to write the screenplay for ''Sisters'' after reading an article in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine in 1966 about the lives of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] conjoined twins [[Masha and Dasha Krivoshlyapova]]: {{blockquote|At the end of the article there was a picture of the two girls sitting on a couch and the caption said that apart from the fact that they were joined at the hip both girls were physiologically normal, but as they were getting older they were developing psychological problems. One of the twins had a very surly, disturbing look on her face and the other looked perfectly healthy and smiling. And this strong visual image started the whole idea off in my mind.{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=3}}}}\n\nThe script, which De Palma co-wrote with Louisa Rose, features structural elements inspired by Hitchcock, such as killing off a prominent character early into the film, alternating points of view, and the involvement of a third party observer in solving a crime.{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=3}} In writing the exposition of the film which details the twins' history and institutionalization, De Palma was influenced by [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), specifically the scene in which Rosemary is raped and conceives her child.{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=3}}\n\n=== Filming ===\n''Sisters'' was shot over a period of eight weeks in [[New York City]] in spring 1972,<ref name=afi/> primarily in the borough of [[Staten Island]].{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=11}} The apartment interiors were filmed on a set, with additional exterior photography of the [[1271 Avenue of the Americas|Time-Life Building]] in [[Manhattan]].{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=11}} The film was shot using [[Mitchell Camera|Mitchell BNC camera]]s with [[Panavision]] lenses.{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=11}} According to De Palma, the film was lit with a \"truly classical style\", with scenes sometimes taking 45 minutes to set up.{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=11}} Some sequences were shot on [[16 mm film]] by De Palma himself, such as the scene in which Emil speaks directly to the camera during the finale's hallucination sequence.{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=12}}\n\n=== Visual style ===\nThe film uses unusual [[point of view shot]]s and [[Split screen (film)|split screen]] effects to show two events happening simultaneously,<ref name=kawin>{{cite web|author=Kawin, Bruce|work=The Current|publisher=The Criterion Collection|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/90-sisters|title=Sisters|date=October 2, 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706122324/https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/90-sisters|archive-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=9}} as well as long [[tracking shot]]s,<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Sisters review \u2013 Philip French on Brian De Palma's Hitchcock-indebted 1973 classic|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/22/sisters-review-philip-french-brian-de-palma-hitchcock|author=French, Philip|date=June 21, 2014|access-date=August 2, 2018}}</ref> some in excess of six minutes in length.{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=7}} The extended tracking shot in Danielle's apartment following the murder of Phillip was influenced by [[Max Oph\u00fcls]] and directly references Hitchcock's ''Rope''.{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=7}} The theme of voyeurism is represented in the alternating points-of-view and distortions of perspective within the narrative [[diegesis]]; De Palma commented: \"I really got the idea from watching the [[Vietnam war]] on television {{en dash}} watching a war that nobody really knew about except that we watched it every night on the 7 o'clock news. It was really a very voyeuristic war, and I think it says a lot about the way we perceive things. We are very much controlled by the media which present things to us. And those can be manipulated.\"{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=10}}\n\nIn order to accomplish the image of both twins conjoined onscreen in the film's finale (both played by Kidder), De Palma had Kidder photographed seated in two different positions, and then joined the images together via [[Optical filter|optical editing]].{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=11}}\n\n=== Musical score ===\nWhile editing the film in post-production, editor Paul Hirsch and De Palma listened to musical scores by [[Bernard Herrmann]] (particularly for ''Psycho'', ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'', and ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'') and played them along with the film's key scenes.{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=4}} This led to De Palma inquiring about Herrmann composing the film's musical score.
