[[Ren\u00e9 Goscinny]] and [[Albert Uderzo]], the creators of the series, wrote the story and directed the film themselves; with co-direction by Pierre Watrin and the screenplay co-written by [[Pierre Tchernia]], a friend of Goscinny and Uderzo. The film was directed, produced and animated at Goscinny and Uderzo's own animation studio, Studios Id\u00e9fix and is the only Asterix animated film that has used the [[Xerography]] Process.{{elucidate|date=May 2013}} At the time of its release, the film received mixed reviews since its tone is more cartoony and frequently breaks the [[fourth wall]]. Nowadays its reception is more favorable, with it often being cited as one of the best ''Ast\u00e9rix'' films, even reaching the status of a [[cult classic]].<ref name=\"lambiek.net\">{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/g/goscinny.htm|title=Ren\u00e9 Goscinny|website=lambiek.net}}</ref><ref name=\"lambiek.net1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/u/uderzo.htm|title=Albert Uderzo|website=lambiek.net}}</ref>\n\nIt was the only Asterix film (animated or live-action) to be based on an original screenplay rather than on material from any of the [[comic book]] stories until the release of ''[[Asterix: The Secret of the Magic Potion]]'' in 2018.<ref name=\"lambiek.net\"/><ref name=\"lambiek.net1\"/> It was later adapted into a comic book as well by Albert Uderzo's brother, [[Marcel Uderzo]],<ref name=\"lambiek.net2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/u/uderzo_marcel.htm|title=Marcel Uderzo|website=lambiek.net}}</ref> as an illustrated text story book and a series of twelve books for young readers.\n\n== Plot ==\nFollowing constant defeats by the rebel village of [[Gaul]], the [[Roman Senate]] begins to suggest that the Gauls might be [[deity|gods]], due to their apparent invincibility. [[Julius Caesar]], openly disdainful of the suggestion, decides to test the village and meets with their chieftain, [[Recurring characters in Asterix#Vitalstatistix|Vitalstatistix]]. Caesar declares that the Gauls must undertake a challenge, inspired by [[Labours of Hercules|the Twelve Labours]] of [[Hercules]]: the village's best warriors shall perform a set of twelve new tasks, which only gods could carry out successfully. Completion of all the tasks will see Caesar hand over the [[Roman Empire]] to them, whereas failing just one task will result in the Gauls surrendering to Rome. Agreeing to the terms, the village assigns Asterix and [[Obelix]] to perform the tasks, with Caesar assigning Caius Tiddlus, a Roman man renowned for his honesty, to act as their guide to the tasks and serve as the challenges' referee.\n\nIn their first set of challenges, Asterix defeats Asbestos, champion of the [[Ancient Olympic Games]], by beating him in a race, and Cilindric the German in a judo match, by outsmarting his opponent. Obelix defeats Verses the Persian, by managing to throw a javelin further than him. In their next challenge, the pair find themselves crossing a lake that is home to beautiful [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s, who reside in the centre on the \"Isle of Pleasure\". Although the Gauls nearly succumb to the women, Obelix comes to his senses when he learns that there are no [[wild boar]]s for him to hunt and eat, allowing the pair to accomplish the challenge. After surviving the [[hypnotic]] gaze of Iris the Egyptian in the fifth task, with Asterix causing him to hypnotise himself, Obelix attempts the sixth task of finishing meals prepared by the Belgian cook Mannekenpix, consuming all the food (which he believes to be his starters).\n\nFollowing their seventh task of enduring the \"Cave of the Beast\", the pair attempt the eighth task of getting a permit document from a multi-storey [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] building. After finding it impossible because of the clinically unhelpful people who direct them elsewhere, Asterix beats them at their own game by asking for an imaginary permit. The staff fall victim to their own behaviour, and cause the Prefect to unwittingly hand over what the Gauls came for. The pair continue to complete further challenges. They cross a ravine filled with [[crocodile]]s by beating them up, rather than using an invisible tightrope. They answer a riddle by the Old Man of the Mountain, conducted in the form of a washing detergent advertisement. They then endure a night on a [[plain]] haunted by [[ghost]]s. Asterix gets rid of them by complaining about the noise and convincing the ghosts to shut up.\n\nAsterix and Obelix eventually find themselves in [[Rome]], alongside their fellow villagers, for their final task. Brought to the [[Circus Maximus]], the Gauls fight against [[gladiator]]s, whom they beat, and defeat various animals sent against them by turning the arena into a modern-day [[circus]]. Having succeeded in every task, Caesar agrees that they are gods, giving the Gauls control of the [[Roman Empire]], while retiring to live a quiet and peaceful life with [[Cleopatra]]. As a reward for his service, Caius Tiddlus retires to the Isle of Pleasure. As the village celebrates their success, Asterix answers Obelix's question of them really conquering Rome by pointing out that everything that happened to them [[Fourth wall|was a mere cartoon]], in which [[Cartoon physics|everything is possible]]. Obelix takes advantage of this and teleports himself and his wild boar meat to the Isle of Pleasure, along with Caius Tiddlus, to enjoy himself.\n\n==Cast==\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Character\n!Original\n!English<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6bd08c94|title=Les DOUZE TRAVAUX D&#039;AST\u00c9RIX (1975)}}</ref>\n|-\n!Asterix\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[Roger Carel]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Se\u00e1n Barrett (actor)|Sean Barrett]]<ref name=\"Twelve Tasks\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/movies/The-Twelve-Tasks-of-Asterix/|title=The Twelve Tasks of Asterix|website=Behind The Voice Actors|language=en-US|access-date=2021-03-26}}</ref>\n|-\n!Caius Tiddlius\n|-\n!Roman Senator #3\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Unknown\n|-\n!Dogmatix\n|-\n!Obelix\n|[[Jacques Morel (actor)|Jacques Morel]]\n|[[Michael Kilgarriff]]<ref name=\"Twelve Tasks\"/>\n|-\n!Fulliautomatix\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Georges Atlas\n|Sean Barrett\n|-\n!Hermes\n|Unknown\n|-\n!Roman Ghost\n|Sean Barrett\n|-\n!A senator and the centurion\n|[[Claude Bertrand (actor)|Claude Bertrand]]\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Unknown\n|-\n!Bureaucrat #5\n|Caroline Cler\n|-\n!Bureaucrat on Swing\n|Claude Dasset\n|-\n!Chief Priestess of the Isle of Pleasure\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Micheline Dax]]\n|Christina Greatrex<ref name=\"Twelve Tasks\"/>\n|-\n!Cleopatra\n|Unknown\n|-\n!Old Man of the Mountains\n|[[G\u00e9rard Hernandez]]\n|Paul Bacon<ref name=\"Twelve Tasks\"/>\n|-\n!Soldier\n|[[Jacques Hilling]]\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Unknown\n|-\n!Bureaucrat #1\n|[[Henri Labussi\u00e8re]]\n|-\n!Bureaucrat #4\n|[[Odette Laure]]\n|-\n!Prefect\n|[[Bernard Lavalette]]\n|-\n!Cylindric\n|Roger Lumont\n|Sean Barrett\n|-\n!Julius Caesar\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Jean Martinelli]]\n|[[John Ringham]]<ref name=\"Twelve Tasks\"/>\n|-\n!Zeus\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Unknown\n|-\n!Roman Senator #1\n|[[Pascal Mazzotti]]\n|-\n!Centurion\n|Henri Poirier\n|-\n!Mannikinpix\n|St\u00e9phane Steeman\n|Sean Barrett\n|-\n!Hera\n|Monique Thubert\n|Unknown\n|-\n!Vitalstatistix\n|[[Pierre Tornade]]\n|Paul Bacon<ref name=\"Twelve Tasks\"/>\n|-\n!Impedimenta\n|Nicole Vervil\n|Unknown\n|-\n!Getafix\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Henri Virlojeux]]\n|Geoffrey Russell<ref name=\"Twelve Tasks\"/>\n|-\n!Iris\n|Paul Bacon<ref name=\"Twelve Tasks\"/>\n|-\n!Narrator\n|[[Pierre Tchernia]]\n|Unknown\n|-\n!Gladiator Trainer\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Unknown\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Sean Barrett\n|-\n!Jailer\n|-\n!Mrs. Geriatrix\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Christina Greatrex\n|-\n!Window 12 Receptionist\n|-\n!Minerva\n|-\n!Cacofonix\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Geoffrey Russell\n|-\n!Senator #4\n|}\n\n===Additional voices===\n* Original: Gis\u00e8le Grimm, Nicole Jonesco, Mary Mongourdin, Lawrence Riesner, Jean Stout, [[Alice Sapritch]]\n* English: Paul Bacon, [[George Baker (British actor)|George Baker]], [[Ysanne Churchman]], Alexander John, [[Barbara Mitchell]], [[Gennie Nevinson]], [[John Ringham]], Paddy Turner\n\n== Home media ==\nIn the United Kingdom, it was watched by 400,000 viewers on television during the first half of 2005, making it the fifth most-watched foreign-language film on UK television during that period.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=September 2005 |title=4.
