It was personally produced by [[Walt Disney]] through [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]], directed by [[Richard Fleischer]], and stars [[Kirk Douglas]], [[James Mason]], [[Paul Lukas]], and [[Peter Lorre]]. It was also the first feature-length Disney film to be distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]]. The film is adapted from [[Jules Verne]]'s 1870 novel ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas]]''.\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success, being especially remembered for the fight with a giant squid, and Mason's definitive performance as the charismatic anti-hero [[Captain Nemo]]. It won two [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Special Effects]]. It is considered an early precursor of the [[steampunk]] genre.<ref>{{cite web|last=Higham|first=William|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/william-higham/steampunk-what-the-hell-is-it_b_1015192.html|title=What The Hell Is Steampunk?|work=The Huffington Post|date=February 17, 2012|access-date=February 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1868, rumors spread of a [[sea monster]] attacking ships in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Professor Aronnax and his assistant, Conseil, are asked to investigate and soon board a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[frigate]]. They are joined by cocky master-harpooner Ned Land.\n\nAfter months of patrolling, the monster is spotted. The frigate's guncrew open fire with their [[Dahlgren gun|Dahlgren cannon]], but the monster turns and rams the warship. Ned, Conseil, and Aronnax are thrown overboard. The disabled frigate drifts away, not responding to their cries for help. Clinging to wreckage, Aronnax and Conseil come upon a metal vessel and realize the monster is a man-made \"submerging boat\" that now appears deserted. Going below decks, Aronnax finds a large viewport and witnesses an underwater funeral, while Ned Land arrives on an overturned longboat from their ship. Spotted by the divers, Ned, Aronnax, and Conseil attempt to leave in the righted longboat, but the divers stop them. The vessel's captain introduces himself as Nemo, master of the ''[[Nautilus (fictional submarine)|Nautilus]]''. He returns Ned and Conseil to the deck while offering Aronnax, whose name he recognizes, the chance to stay. After Aronnax proves willing to die with his companions, Nemo allows Ned and Conseil to remain aboard.\n\nNemo takes ''Nautilus'' to the [[penal colony]] island of Rura Penthe, where the prisoners are loading a munitions ship. Nemo, once a prisoner here as were many of his crew, later rams the steamer, destroying it and its crew. Nemo tells Aronnax that he has just saved thousands from death in war, and that \"this hated nation\" tortured his wife and son to death while attempting to force him to reveal his discoveries. In Nemo's cabin, Ned and Conseil discover the map coordinates of Nemo's secret island base, Vulcania, where ''Nautilus'' is heading. Ned throws messages overboard in bottles in the hope of being rescued.\n\nOff the coast of [[New Guinea]], ''Nautilus'' becomes stranded on a reef. Nemo allows Ned to go ashore with Conseil, ostensibly to collect specimens, while admonishing them to stay on the beach. Ned instead goes exploring for avenues of escape, and finds human skulls posted on stakes. Ned quickly rejoins Conseil, and they row away pursued by cannibals. Aboard ''Nautilus'', the cannibals are repelled by an electrical charge sent through its hull, and Nemo confines Ned for disobeying orders.\n\nA warship fires upon ''Nautilus'', which descends into the depths, attracting a [[giant squid]]. After an electric charge fails to repel the creature, Nemo and his men surface during a violent storm to dislodge it. Nemo is caught by one of its long tentacles, and Ned, having escaped from captivity, fatally harpoons the squid, saving Nemo. Having had a change of heart, Nemo wants to make amends with the world.\n\nAs ''Nautilus'' nears Vulcania, Nemo finds the island surrounded by warships, with marines having disembarked. Nemo submerges ''Nautilus'', enters his base from underwater, and surfaces within its large lagoon. He rushes ashore to activate a prearranged time bomb in order to destroy any evidence of his discoveries, but is shot and mortally wounded. Navigating the submarine to a safe distance from Vulcania, Nemo announces that he will be \"taking the ''Nautilus'' down for the last time\". His crew declare that they will accompany their captain in death.\n\nAronnax, Conseil, and Ned are confined to their cabins, while ''Nautilus''{{'}}s crew retreat to their own at Nemo's instructions. Ned escapes and surfaces the submarine, striking a reef in the process, causing ''Nautilus'' to flood. Nemo dies while viewing his beloved undersea domain through the hull's viewport.\n\nAronnax tries retrieving his journal, but the urgency of their escape obliges Ned to knock him unconscious and carry him out. Aboard ''Nautilus''{{'}}s skiff, the three companions witness Vulcania explode. A large, billowing mushroom cloud rises above the island's destruction. Ned apologizes to Aronnax for striking him, but Aronnax concedes that the loss of his journal might have been for the best. As ''Nautilus'' sinks, Nemo's last words to Aronnax echo: \"There is hope for the future. And when the world is ready for a new and better life, all this will someday come to pass... in God's good time\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:20000leaguescast.jpg|thumb|Dinner aboard the ''Nautilus''.

James W. Maertens writes that while this is true, \"Close comparison of the novel and film reveals many changes, omissions, even reversals, which affect the story's fundamental concern (besides scientific education), a representation of class and gender, specifically masculinity, in the industrial age\". Nemo's submarine, battery-powered in the novel, is powered by [[Nuclear reactor|atomic energy]] in the film. The novel's submarine is also a \"streamlined, cigar shaped sub\" while the film's is \"a more ornate vessel\". The film's director and screenwriter extracted \"the most memorable scenes from the novel and freely reordered them under the assumption that viewers would not remember the novel's order of events\". Goff and Disney based the Nautilus's design in the film on the interior of the [[Forth Bridge]].<ref name=\":0\" /> In the novel, Nemo orders parts from various industries, secretly shipping them to an island for assembly, whom Maertens labeled \"a logistical genius at manipulating [[Industrial Age]] manufacturing\".<ref>{{cite book | last=Maertens | first=James W. | chapter=Brains, Brawn, and Masculine Desire in Walt Disney's ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'' | editor1-last= Brode | editor1-first=Douglas | editor2-last=Brode | editor2-first=Shea T. | year=2016 | title=Debating Disney: Pedagogical Perspectives on Commercial Cinema | publisher=Rowman & Littlefield | isbn=978-1-4422-6609-4 | pages=19\u201332 }}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nRather than an authentic soundtrack recording of the film's [[film score|score]] or dialogue, two [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] studio cast record albums were released to coincide with the film's first two releases (1954 and 1963). Both albums contained condensed and heavily altered versions of the film's script without the usage of any of the film's cast for character voices. In addition, both albums were narrated by Ned Land as opposed to Aronnax, who narrated the film and the original novel. Neither album mentioned Nemo as actually being \"cracked\" (i.e. insane), as the film does, and considerably sanitized the character by omitting any mention of him killing anyone. The albums also had Nemo surviving at the end and releasing Ned, Arronax, and Conseil out of gratitude for their saving his life.<ref>{{YouTube|ex89G23PnbM}}</ref> In this version, Ned, Aronnax and Conseil were not shipwrecked because the Nautilus rammed the ship they were on, but because a hurricane came up.<ref>[http://www.kiddierecords.com/mgac/index_2.htm \"More Golden Age Classics: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\"] ''Kidde Records'', July 15, 2011.
