The film stars [[Carey Mulligan]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], [[Brendan Gleeson]], [[Anne-Marie Duff]], [[Ben Whishaw]], and [[Meryl Streep]].<ref name=\"Meryl\" />\n\nFilming began on 24 February 2014. It is the first feature film to be shot in the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]]. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 12 October 2015 by the French film company [[Path\u00e9]] through its British distributor [[20th Century Fox]]. Originally scheduled to be released by [[Relativity Media]], the film was ultimately released in a [[limited release]] in North America on 23 October 2015 by [[Focus Features]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1912, Maud Watts is a 24-year-old laundry worker. While delivering a package, she is caught up in a [[suffragette]] protest which includes her workmate, Violet Miller.\n\nAlice Haughton, the wife of an MP, encourages women from the laundry to testify to a Parliamentary committee. Violet offers but is beaten by her abusive husband and Maud testifies. The women later learn, at a public announcement, that the vote is not to be extended. Maud is caught up in the protest, arrested, and jailed for a week. While in jail, she meets [[Emily Davison]], a confidante of [[Emmeline Pankhurst]].\n\nMaud faces stigma from neighbours and workmates. She tells her husband Sonny that she will stay away from the suffragettes but attends a secret rally to hear Pankhurst speak. She has a brief exchange with Pankhurst. Again detained, she is taken home by police. This time, her husband throws her out. Maud struggles to see her son, continuing to work until her picture is published as a known suffragette. Maud is then sacked and, past breaking point, she burns the hand of her male supervisor, who has been sexually abusing girls in the laundry for years, including Maud when she was younger, and Maggie, Violet's daughter. The police are called, and Inspector Steed allows Maud to leave, offering her an opportunity to act as an informer. Maud refuses.\n\nSonny continues to prevent Maud from seeing their son, George. This prompts Maud into more radicalism in favour of women's rights. She learns that Sonny has offered George for adoption. Maud becomes more radical and is involved in bombing [[pillar box]]es and cutting telegraph wires. She and her comrades are imprisoned after they blow up an empty Parliamentary residence. In prison, Maud goes on [[hunger strike]] and is subjected to brutal [[force-feeding]].\n\nThe suffragettes feel that they must do still more to gain attention. They decide to attend the [[Epsom Derby|Derby]] when [[George V|King George V]] will be in attendance, planning to step in front of the cameras and unfurl their banners. Before they go, Emily Davison hands Maud a copy of ''Dreams'' (1890), a book by [[Olive Schreiner]] that has been passed from one suffragette to another. On the day of the Derby, only Maud and Emily attend. They are barred from the area near the King, but Emily decides that they must carry on anyway. While the race is underway, Emily runs onto the track, stepping in front of Anmer, the King's horse, and Maud witnesses her being [[Emily Davison#Fatal injury at the Derby|trampled to death]]. After returning to London, Maud retrieves Violet's daughter, Maggie, from the laundry, and takes her to the home of Alice Haughton, who agrees that Maggie can work there instead. Maud later joins in Emily's funeral procession. The film ends by stating that Emily's funeral was reported around the world; and that certain women over 30 in the UK were given the right to vote in 1918, rights over their own children in 1925, and the same voting rights as men in 1928.

The LFF director, Clare Stewart, said Gavron's feature was an \"urgent and compelling film, made by British women, about British women who changed the course of history\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://whatsworthseeing.com/suffragette-to-open-london-film-festival-2015/ |title= Suffragette to open London Film Festival 2015 |last=Korsner |first=Jason |date=3 June 2015 |work=What\u2019s Worth Seeing... |access-date=3 June 2015}}</ref> The film premiered at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on 4 September 2015.\n\nTo promote the film before its October 2015 release, ''Suffragette'' teamed with the magazine ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out London]]'' to develop a marketing campaign featuring the film's stars. After its publication in September 2015, the resulting material generated controversy among media outlets. Mulligan, Streep, Garai and Duff appeared in a promotional photograph wearing T-shirts emblazoned with a Pankhurst quotation used in the film: \"I'd rather be a rebel than a slave\". This quickly led to a media furore, with critics describing the magazine's choice of slogan \"unfortunate\",<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.vulture.com/2015/10/meryl-streep-suffragette-shirt-is-unfortunate.html | title=Meryl Streep's T-Shirt Promoting Suffragette is Unfortunate }}</ref> \"tone-deaf\",<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.themarysue.com/suffragette-shirts/ | title=Suffragette's \"I'd Rather be a Rebel Than a Slave\" Shirts Are Tone-Deaf | date=5 October 2015 }}</ref> and \"racist\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11914757/Racism-and-the-suffragettes-the-uncomfortable-truth.html | title=The uncomfortable truth about racism and the suffragettes }}</ref> Scholar Ana Stevenson noted that while from a historical perspective the usage of the Pankhurst quotation in the film was accurate, \"Meryl Streep, Carey Mulligan, Romola Garai and Anne-Marie Duff are rich, privileged, white women who are celebrity movie stars \u2013 certainly not slaves\"; Stevenson further argued that there is \"a perversity in claiming otherwise when racial discrimination and domestic violence remain very present concerns\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/the-suffragettes-were-rebels-certainly-but-not-slaves-48673|title=The suffragettes were rebels, certainly, but not slaves|last=Stevenson|first=Ana|website=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]|access-date=1 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe feminist group [[Sisters Uncut]] demonstrated at the London premiere against government cuts to domestic violence services.
