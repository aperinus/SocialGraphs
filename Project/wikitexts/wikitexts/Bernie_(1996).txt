He was found in a garbage can when he was only a few months old. His first name comes from the man who found him there (Bernie, the building's janitor) and his last name comes from the time of year when he was found (No\u00ebl, \"Christmas\" in French).\n\nAt age 29, Bernie decides to leave the orphanage to explore a world that he knows only through television and what his friends have told him. On his own, roaming a Paris-by-night hostile environment, he goes through several madly epic adventures searching for his parents, before eventually finding them and \"saving\" them from an imaginary government conspiracy.\n\nThis neurotic and maladjusted young man will bring mischief and mayhem in his trail, which will lead him and his loved ones to a dramatic conclusion...\n\n==Film info==\n* Directed by : Albert Dupontel\n* Story : Albert Dupontel and Gilles Laurent\n* Dialogues : Albert Dupontel\n* Production : Canal+, Contre Prod, Kasso Inc.
