Written by [[Jeremy Leven]], the film is about a writer who must publish a novel in thirty days or face the wrath of loan sharks.<ref name=\"imdb\">{{cite web|title=Alex & Emma |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318283/ |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAlex Sheldon, a struggling writer, finds himself in a tricky situation. With writer's block and heavily in debt: he is broke, and must repay US$100,000 to the Cuban mafia. Since his publisher will give him the money when the novel is finished. He is given a 30-day ultimatum to pay the money he owes or they will kill him. And the only solution to this big problem is to finish his novel. Or rather, to start it, since he has not written one single line. But he has an idea for the story: A comedy about \"the powerlessness of being in love, how love devours the insides of a person like a deadly virus\".\n\nHe decides to hire the services of Emma Dinsmore, a stubborn [[stenographer]], for her help to write the novel. The novel tells the story of Adam Shipley, a writer who has been hired to tutor the children of an attractive French woman. She is going through bad economic times, and Adam falls in love, despite the failed temptations of the ''au pair''.\n\nAs Alex dictates his novel to Emma, the movie cuts away to scenes from the novel, where Adam interacts with a series of nannies, and falls for the last one. As they work together, Emma begins to question his ideas. It starts to affect his life as well as his work. They soon fall for each other.\n\nAlas, after finishing the book, Emma discovers that the French woman in the story was based on a real person, a former girlfriend of Alex. His ex just broke up with her latest boyfriend, sitting with him in a caf\u00e9 she invites him to a charity ball. Alex soon realizes that the person he really wants to be with is Emma.\n\nAfter the book is done and handed in to his publisher he pays off his debt. Then, after much prodding, he convinces Emma to rewrite the ending of the book in which Alex has changed. He shows her he wants her to be an important part of his life. Emma loves it, Alex professes his love to her, and they kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kate Hudson]] as Emma Dinsmore / Ylva / Elsa / Eldora / Anna\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Alex Sheldon / Adam Shipley\n* [[David Paymer]] as John Shaw\n* [[Sophie Marceau]] as Polina Delacroix\n* [[Rob Reiner]] as Wirschafter\n* [[Chino XL]] as Tony / Flamenco Dancer No. 2\n* Lobo Sebastian as Bobby / Flamenco Dancer No. 1\n* [[Paul Willson]] as Whistling John Shaw\n* Alexander Wauthier as Andre Delacroix\n* Leili Kramer as Michele Delacroix\n* [[Rip Taylor]] as Polina's Father\n* Gigi Bermingham as Madame Blanche\n* [[Jordan Lund]] as Claude\n* Fran\u00e7ois Giroday as Croupier\n* [[Robert Costanzo]] as Bus Driver\n* [[Cloris Leachman]] as Grandmother\n* Earl Carroll as Bernard Pompier\n* Jordi Caballero as Flamenco Dancer No. 3\n* Michael St. Michaels as Casino Owner\n* Danica Sheridan as Receptionist<ref name=\"imdbcast\">{{cite web|title=Full cast and crew for Alex & Emma |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318283/fullcredits#cast |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\nDeveloped under the working title, ''Loosely Based on a True Love Story'', the film is loosely based on a true love story of author [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], who dictated his 1866 novel, ''[[The Gambler (novel)|The Gambler]]'' in 30 days in order to pay off a gambling debt and, in the process, fell in love with his young [[stenographer]].\n\nThe film was modeled after the 1964 [[Audrey Hepburn]] film, ''[[Paris When It Sizzles]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Anchor|Box office}}\n''Alex & Emma'' was a flop, grossing $15 million at the box office, against a $30 million production budget.<ref name=\"numbers\" />\n\n{{Anchor|Critical response}}\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an 11% approval rating based on 141 reviews, with an average rating of 3.80/10.
