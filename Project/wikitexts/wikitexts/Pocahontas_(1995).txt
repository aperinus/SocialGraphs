The film romanticizes Pocahontas' encounter with [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] and her legendary saving of his life. The film was produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. It is the [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|33rd Disney animated feature film]] and the sixth film produced and released during the [[Disney Renaissance]].\n\nThe film was directed by [[Mike Gabriel]] and [[Eric Goldberg (animator)|Eric Goldberg]] (his feature directorial debut). The voice cast stars [[Irene Bedard]] and [[Mel Gibson]] as Pocahontas and Smith, respectively, with [[David Ogden Stiers]], [[Russell Means]], [[Christian Bale]], [[Billy Connolly]], and [[Linda Hunt]] providing other voices. The score was written by [[Alan Menken]], who also wrote the film's songs with [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]].\n\nAfter making his directorial debut with ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'' (1990), Gabriel conceived the film during a [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] weekend. The project went into development concurrently with ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994), and attracted most of Disney's top animators. Meanwhile, Disney studio chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] decided that the film should be a serious romantic epic in the vein of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991), in hope that like ''Beauty'', it would also be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. Screenwriters [[Carl Binder]], [[Susannah Grant]], and [[Philip LaZebnik]] took creative liberties with history in an attempt to make the film palatable to audiences.\n\n''Pocahontas'' was released on June 16, 1995, to mixed reactions from reviewers, who praised its animation, voice performances, and music, but criticized its story with its lack of focus on tone. The film's historical inaccuracies and racial overtones received polarized responses. ''Pocahontas'' earned over $346 million at the box office. The film received two [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Musical or Comedy Score]] for Menken and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"[[Colors of the Wind]]\". According to critics, the depiction of Pocahontas as an empowered heroine influenced subsequent Disney films like ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' (1998) and ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'' (2013).<ref name=atlantic/>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn 1607, the [[Susan Constant]] travels from [[London]] to the [[New World]], carrying [[Kingdom of England|English]] settlers from the Virginia Company. The settlers, including Captain [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]], talk of adventure, finding gold, fighting \"[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Injuns]]\" and potentially settling in the new land.\n\nIn the [[Powhatan]] tribe in [[Werowocomoco]], [[Tsenacommacah]], [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]], the daughter of [[Powhatan (Native American leader)|Chief Powhatan]], fears being possibly wed to Kocoum, a warrior whom she sees as too serious for her own free-spirited personality. After having a dream about a spinning arrow, Pocahontas visits Grandmother Willow, a spiritual talking [[willow tree]] that alerts her to the arriving English.\n\nThe voyage's leader [[John Ratcliffe (governor)|Governor Ratcliffe]], who only seeks wealth and status, has [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] built in a wooded clearing and immediately has the crewmen dig for gold. John departs to explore the wilderness and encounters Pocahontas. At first, he cannot understand her language, but Grandmother Willow gives him the ability to do so. They quickly bond, fascinated by each other's worlds, and end up falling in love. After a fight between settlers and natives, Powhatan orders Pocahontas to stay away from the Englishmen. Pocahontas, however, disobeys him and keeps meeting with John. Unfortunately, Pocahontas's best friend, Nakoma, discovers the secret relationship and warns Kocoum. Ratcliffe also learns of John's encounters and angrily warns him against sparing any Natives.\n\nLater, John and Pocahontas meet with Grandmother Willow and plan to bring peace between the colonists and the tribe. While by both parties spy on the couple, John and Pocahontas share a kiss. Furious, Kocoum attacks and attempts to kill John, but Englishman Thomas intervenes by killing the native (incidentally at Ratcliffe's advice). Thomas flees while the tribesmen arrive and capture John. Enraged at Kocoum's death, Powhatan angrily berates Pocahontas for leaving the village and declares war on the English, beginning with John's execution at dawn.\n\nAfter reaching Jamestown, Thomas warns the English settlers of John's capture. Ratcliffe then rallies his men to battle, using this as an excuse to annihilate the tribe and find their nonexistent gold. That same night, Powhatan also orders his men to prepare for battle. A desperate Pocahontas visits Grandmother Willow and realizes the arrow from John's compass is the same spinning arrow from her dream, which leads to her destiny. Morning comes, and Powhatan and his tribe drag John to a cliff for his execution. Meanwhile, Ratcliffe leads the armed colonists to fight Powhatan's warriors. Just as Powhatan is about to execute John, Pocahontas intervenes and finally convinces him to end the fighting between the two groups and spare John's life. Both sides stand down, and John is released. When the unmoved Ratcliffe orders his men to attack, they refuse. Enraged, Ratcliffe fires his musket at Powhatan, but John takes the shot to save him. Livid, the settlers turn on Ratcliffe and detain him for hurting their comrade.\n\nJohn is nursed back to health by the tribe but must return to England for his wounds to fully heal. Ratcliffe is also sent back to face punishment for his crimes against the settlement. John asks Pocahontas to come with him, but she chooses to stay with her tribe to help keep the peace. John leaves without Pocahontas, but with Powhatan's blessing to return anytime he likes. At the end, Pocahontas stands atop a cliff, watching the ship carrying John depart.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Irene Bedard]] as [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]], the daughter of Chief Powhatan.

In April and May 1991, they first partnered on an adaptation of ''[[Swan Lake]]'' with both of them writing story outlines and creating conceptual artwork. Gabriel and Grant then submitted their outline for approval, but it was negatively received by the studio's live-action [[Script analyst|script readers]].{{sfn|Canemaker|2010|p=188}}{{sfn|Ghez|2020|pp=116\u2013117}} Earlier, during Thanksgiving weekend, 1990, Gabriel had wanted to direct an animated musical set in the [[Western United States|American West]].

Following the cancellation of ''Swan Lake'', Gabriel returned to the idea.{{sfn|Ghez|2020|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nShortly after, Gabriel pitched his idea at the \"Gong Show\" meeting held by [[Michael Eisner]], [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]], and [[Roy E.
