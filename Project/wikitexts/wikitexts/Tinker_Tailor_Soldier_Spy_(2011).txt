The screenplay was written by [[Bridget O'Connor]] and [[Peter Straughan]], based on [[John le Carr\u00e9]]'s 1974 [[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy|novel of the same name]]. The film stars [[Gary Oldman]] as [[George Smiley]], with [[Colin Firth]], [[Tom Hardy]], [[John Hurt]], [[Toby Jones]], [[Mark Strong]], [[Benedict Cumberbatch]], [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]], [[David Dencik]] and [[Kathy Burke]] supporting. It is set in London in the early 1970s and follows the hunt for a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[double agent]] at the top of the British secret service.\n\nThe film was produced through the British company [[Working Title Films]] and financed by France's [[StudioCanal]]. It premiered in competition at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]]. A critical and commercial success, it was the highest-grossing film at the British box office for three consecutive weeks. It won the [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film]]. The film also received three [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations: [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], and for Oldman, [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]].\n\nThe novel had previously been adapted into the award-winning 1979 [[BBC]] [[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (TV series)|television series of the same name]] with [[Alec Guinness]] playing the lead role of Smiley.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- DO NOT ADD CAST NAMES INTO THIS SECTION. The cast list is already shown in the section below -->\nIn 1973 \"[[Control (fictional character)|Control]]\", head of [[Secret Intelligence Service|British intelligence]] (\"The Circus\"), sends [[Jim Prideaux]] to [[Budapest]] to meet a [[Hungarian People's Army|Hungarian]] general who has the name of a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] at the top of British Intelligence. Prideaux, realising the meeting is a trap, is shot as he tries to flee. Control and his right-hand man [[George Smiley]] are forced to retire, and Control dies soon after. Percy Alleline becomes the new Chief, Bill Haydon his deputy, and Roy Bland and Toby Esterhase his lieutenants. They had already begun receiving Soviet Intelligence from a secret source (Operation \"Witchcraft\").\n\n[[Field agent]] [[Ricki Tarr]] warns [[undersecretary]] Oliver Lacon that there is a mole at the top of the Circus. Knowing that Control had the same theory, Lacon asks Smiley to investigate, helped by Tarr's boss [[Peter Guillam]] and retired [[Special Branch (Metropolitan Police)|Special Branch]] officer Mendel.\n\nSmiley interviews [[Intelligence analysis|analyst]] Connie Sachs, who was sacked for deducing that Soviet [[cultural attach\u00e9]] Alexei Polyakov was a military officer and suspecting he was running a mole in London.\n\nTarr tells Smiley that in [[Istanbul]] Soviet agent Irina wanted to exchange the identity of the mole in return for [[Right of asylum|asylum]]. Hours after Tarr cabled London that a Soviet defector could identify a double agent, the local [[station chief]] was murdered and Irina abducted. Fearing for his life, Tarr went into hiding. Smiley sends Guillam to steal the duty officer's logbook for the night Tarr contacted London. Guillam is unexpectedly brought before Circus leadership and told that Tarr is a traitor. Smiley finds that the logbook pages for the relevant night have been removed, supporting Tarr's story. Smiley is convinced the mole is trying to discredit Tarr.\n\nSmiley tells Guillam that in 1955 he had urged Moscow's spymaster [[Karla (character)|Karla]] to defect, begging him to \"think of his wife\" and realised too late that he had revealed his own weak spot: his love for his wife. Former [[duty officer]] Jerry Westerby tells Smiley of how Prideaux's shooting sent Control into shock. Westerby left a message with Ann Smiley - Haydon then arrived and took charge. Guillam wonders how Haydon could have learned of the emergency, but Smiley tells him Haydon was having an affair with Ann.\n\nPrideaux, who is in fact alive and now a [[schoolmaster]], tells Smiley that his Budapest mission was to relay the identity of the mole to Control, via one of the [[code name]]s assigned by Control to each of the members of the Circus suspected to be the mole - \u201cTinker\u201d, \u201cTailor\u201d, \u201cSoldier\u201d, \u201cPoorman\u201d and \u201cBeggarman\u201d. He was [[torture]]d by the [[KGB]], and saw Irina shot in front of him.\n\nSmiley informs Lacon and the Minister that Operation Witchcraft is a ruse. The service believes Polyakov is bringing it Russian secrets, when in reality the mole is using the meets to send British secrets to Karla. The high quality of Witchcraft's intelligence is designed to lure the CIA into sharing intelligence with Britain, which the mole can then also leak to Karla.\n\nSmiley threatens Esterhase with deportation to obtain the Witchcraft [[safe house]] address. Tarr visits the Paris station and informs London that he has vital information. Smiley waits at the safe house for the mole to alert Polyakov that Tarr is about to blow their cover, and arrests Haydon at gunpoint. Haydon later confirms that he seduced Ann on Karla's orders to cloud Smiley's judgement. After Smiley's departure Prideaux shoots and kills Haydon from a distance. Ann returns home, and Smiley returns to the Circus as its Chief.\n\n==Cast  ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as [[George Smiley]] (\"Spy\")\n* [[Colin Firth]] as [[Bill Haydon]] (\"Tailor\")\n* [[Tom Hardy]] as [[Ricki Tarr]]\n* [[Mark Strong]] as [[Jim Prideaux]]\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as Roy Bland (\"Soldier\")\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as [[Peter Guillam]]\n* [[David Dencik]] as [[Toby Esterhase]] (\"Poorman\")\n* [[Stephen Graham]] as [[Gerald Westerby|Jerry Westerby]]\n* [[Simon McBurney]] as Oliver Lacon\n* [[Toby Jones]] as Percy Alleline (\"Tinker\")\n* [[John Hurt]] as [[Control (fictional character)|Control]]\n* [[Kathy Burke]] as [[Connie Sachs]]\n* [[Roger Lloyd-Pack]] as Mendel\n* [[Svetlana Khodchenkova]] as Irina\n* [[Konstantin Khabensky]] as Polyakov\n* [[Mike Sarne|Michael Sarne]] as [[Karla (character)|Karla]]\n* [[John le Carr\u00e9]] as Christmas party guest\n* Katrina Vasilieva as Ann Smiley\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe project was initiated by [[Peter Morgan]] when he wrote a draft of the screenplay, which he offered to Working Title Films to produce.
