The film's screenwriter was inspired to write the script after he was in a car accident. Yglesias began writing the story after reading about [[United Airlines Flight 232]], that crashed in Sioux City, Iowa, in 1989.<ref>[http://www.ew.com/article/1993/10/15/fearless-screenwriters-real-life-brush-death Fearless screenwriter] accessed 11/23/2016</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nMax Klein survives an airline crash. The plane plummets, but strangely Max is calm. His calm enables him to dispel fear in the flight cabin. He sits next to Byron Hummel, a young boy flying alone. Flight attendants move through the cabin, telling another passenger, Carla Rodrigo, traveling with an infant, to hold the infant in her lap as the plane plummets out of control, while telling other passengers to buckle into their seats. Max was telling his business partner, Jeff Gordon, of his fear of flying as they took off.\n\nIn the aftermath of the crash, most passengers died. Among the few survivors, most are terribly injured. Max is unhurt. The crash site is chaotic, filled with first responders and other emergency personnel. Focusing on the survivors, a team of investigators from the [[FAA]] and the airline company conduct interviews. Max is repelled by all the chaos. He is disgusted by the investigators wanting to interview him.\n\nMax rents a car and starts driving home. Along the way he meets an old girlfriend from high school, Alison. They last met 20 years ago. At the restaurant Alison notices Max eating a strawberry. Max is allergic to strawberries. Max grins. He finishes the strawberry without an allergic reaction. The next morning, he is accosted by [[FBI]] investigators.  They question his choice to not contact family to tell them he is fine. The airline representative offers him train tickets. Max asks for airline tickets. He wants to fly home, having no fear of air travel. The airline books him on the flight. They seat him next to Dr. Bill Perlman, the airline's psychiatrist.\n\nDr. Perlman annoyingly tags behind Max back to his home, prodding him for information about the crash. Max is forced to snap back at the psychiatrist rudely, to be rid of him. Laura Klein, Max's wife, notices the strange behavior. Max seems different, changed somehow. Max's late business partner's wife, Nan Gordon, asks about Jeff's last moments. Max says Jeff died in the crash.\n\nThe media call Max \"The Good Samaritan\" in news reports. The boy Max sat next to, Byron, publicly thanks him in television interviews, for the way he comforted passengers while the plane fell out of control during the crash. Max is a hero.\n\nMax avoids the press and becomes distant from Laura and his son Jonah. His persona is radically changed. He is preoccupied with his new perspective on life following his [[near-death experience]]. He begins drawing abstract pictures of the crash. As he survived without injury, he thinks himself invulnerable to death. Because of his confidence, Dr. Perlman encourages Max to meet with another survivor, Carla Rodrigo, whose infant was held in her lap while the plane fell. Carla struggles with survivor's guilt, and is traumatized for not holding onto him tightly enough, although she was following the flight attendant's instructions. Max and Carla develop a close friendship. He helps her to get past the trauma, to free herself from guilt, deliberately crashing his car to show that it was physically impossible for any person to hold onto anything due to the forces of the crash.\n\nAttorney Steven Brillstein encourages Max to exaggerate testimony, to maximize the settlement offer from the airline. Max reluctantly agrees when he is confronted with Nan's financial predicament as a widow. [[Cognitive dissonance]] spurs Max to a [[panic attack]]. He runs out of the office, to the roof of the building. He climbs onto the roof's edge. As Max stands on the ledge, looking down at the streets below, his panic subsides. He rejoices in fearlessness. Laura finds Max on the ledge. He is spinning around on the ledge with his overcoat billowing across his face.\n\nBrillstein arrives at the Klein home to celebrate the airline's settlement offer. He brings a fruit basket. Max eats one of the strawberries. This time he experiences an allergic reaction. Max is resuscitated by Laura and survives. He recovers his emotional connection to his family, to the world and to the reality of yet another chance at life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Max Klein\n* [[Isabella Rossellini]] as Laura Klein\n* [[Rosie Perez]] as Carla Rodrigo\n* [[Tom Hulce]] as Steven Brillstein\n* [[John Turturro]] as Dr. Bill Perlman\n* [[Benicio del Toro]] as Manny Rodrigo\n* [[Deirdre O'Connell (actress)|Deirdre O'Connell]] as Nan Gordon\n* [[John de Lancie]] as Jeff Gordon\n* [[Debra Monk]] as Alison\n* [[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]] as Elderly Man\n\n==Aesthetic elements==\nA book containing the painting ''[[Ascent of the Blessed|The Ascent into the Empyrean]]''<!--- the name used in the film; there are several for the same painting ---> by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] is shown, and it is said that the dying go into the light of heaven \"naked and alone\".
