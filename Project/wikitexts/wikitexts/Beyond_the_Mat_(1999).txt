Blaustein]]. The film focuses on the lives of [[professional wrestling|professional wrestlers]] outside of the ring, primarily [[Mick Foley]], [[Terry Funk]], and [[Jake Roberts]], as well as some aspiring wrestlers. It focuses on the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) during its rise in popularity, and many other independent wrestlers and organizations. The film was originally released in U.S. theaters in March 2000, and later on VHS and DVD.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2021}}\nDirector Barry Blaustein discusses his love for professional wrestling and clips of him viewing employees of the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] and [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]]. He then decides to travel the [[United States]] over a three-year period, endeavoring to understand the mindset of someone who would voluntarily choose to become a professional wrestler. Blaustein interviews a wide variety of wrestling personalities and ascertains their motivations.\n\nBlaustein focuses on three famous wrestlers, one at the height of his career ([[Mick Foley|Mick Foley, aka \"Mankind\"]]), one contemplating retirement ([[Terry Funk]]) and one at a career low ([[Jake Roberts|Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts]]). He begins by following Funk, a 53-year-old man in need of knee surgery who appears unable to retire, despite the mounting toll wrestling is taking on his body.<ref name=cnn/><ref name=100best/> Blaustein follows him as he competes at [[hardcore wrestling]] promotion [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]]'s first pay-per-view event [[ECW Barely Legal|Barely Legal]] in 1997. Funk also appears with his friend, former wrestler [[Dennis Stamp]], who is eager to work as a referee in Funk's [[Terry Funk's WrestleFest|upcoming \"retirement\" match]]. Stamp discusses the fact that he has not wrestled in years, but remains in shape just in case he gets the call, and demonstrates his unusual workout regimen: jumping on a trampoline in his backyard while holding hand weights.\n\nFunk's sometime in-ring rival, Foley, is profiled next. He has been taking increasingly risky falls (or \"[[bump (professional wrestling)|bumps]]\") and blows to the head, and at one point is heard talking incoherently as the result of a fall (from his [[Mankind vs. The Undertaker|Hell in a Cell match]] against [[The Undertaker]] at [[King of the Ring (1998)|King of the Ring]] 1998) which briefly rendered him unconscious. Clips of Foley with his wife and children are spliced with the clips of him risking his body for the sport. Later, in the film's climax, his wife and young children (particularly his daughter [[Noelle Foley|Noelle]]) watch in horror from the front of the audience during Foley's [[\"I Quit\" match]] at the [[Royal Rumble (1999)|1999 Royal Rumble]], wherein he takes multiple unprotected shots to the head by [[Dwayne Johnson|Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson]] with a steel folding chair.<ref name=cnn/> Four weeks after the match, Blaustein was haunted by seeing Foley's family reaction to the Royal Rumble match. Blaustein decided to show Foley and his wife the footage he captured at the event. After watching the footage, Foley admitted he felt guilty for putting his family through the ordeal, and said he never wanted to put them in that position again.\n\nLastly, Roberts is a wrestler whose height of popularity was in the 1980s. Now he is a [[crack cocaine]] [[Substance dependence|addict]], and estranged from his daughter.<ref name=cnn/> Although he was once one of the more famous wrestlers in America, performing in front of tens of thousands of fans, he is now wrestling in small-town venues. In the course of the film, Roberts is shown attempting to reconcile with his daughter and being interviewed after reportedly smoking [[crack cocaine]] in a hotel room (the act is not shown on camera), as well as musing aloud about his increasingly illicit sexual dalliances while traveling.<ref name=bites/>\n\nThe careers of the three successful wrestlers are contrasted with those of wrestlers who have not yet achieved comparable success, such as two men getting started in the sport of wrestling, [[Tony Jones (wrestler)|Tony Jones]] and [[Michael Modest]], who are granted a tryout match for the WWF.<ref name=100best/> In addition, [[Darren Drozdov]] is a former [[National Football League|NFL]] [[American football|football]] player who is shown in an interview with [[Vince McMahon]].<ref name=ew/> Drozdov, who can [[vomiting|vomit]] at will, is called on by McMahon to vomit in a bucket as a demonstration of his ability&mdash;an ability which earned him the ring name \"Puke\"&mdash;which McMahon plans to use as part of Drozdov's new in-ring persona.<ref name=ew/> Drozdov becomes a [[WWE|WWF]] [[professional wrestling|wrestler]], but at the end of the film, it is revealed that Droz was paralyzed in an in-ring accident from a botched maneuver several months later.\n\n==Production and release==\n[[File:The ROCK.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Dwayne Johnson]] made his first film appearance in ''Beyond the Mat'']]\nBlaustein decided to make a documentary about professional wrestling after being outed as a professional wrestling fan.<ref name=100best>{{cite book|title=The 100 Best Movies You've Never Seen|author=Crouse, Richard|publisher=ECW Press|year=2003|isbn=1-55022-590-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/100bestmoviesyou0000crou/page/18 18\u201322]|url=https://archive.org/details/100bestmoviesyou0000crou/page/18}}</ref> His original budget was $500,000, funded by the company Imagine.<ref name=100best/> He shot footage for the film over a span of three to five years.<ref name=100best/><ref name=int/>\n\n[[World Championship Wrestling]] refused to participate in the film.<ref name=int>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingChats/jun6_blau.html|title=Barry Blaustein chat|publisher=SLAM!

Blaustein also revealed that after the first viewing, it was Linda McMahon who was more upset than Vince, due to the documentary's portrayal of the company, and a lack of emphasis on the \"fun\" in professional wrestling.\n\n===Fate of the wrestlers profiled===\nIn the years after the film was released, the three wrestlers primarily profiled continued their lives largely on the same path. Foley retired from full-time competition in 2000, at age 34, due to health concerns related to his [[Hardcore wrestling|hardcore style]] of wrestling, as well as him and his wife Colette (who was featured in the film with their two older children) having two more children after the film was released. He had, however, wrestled on occasion afterward. Foley was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] on April 6, 2013,<ref name=\"HallOfFame\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/classics/wwe-hall-of-fame/mick-foley-to-be-inducted-into-wwe-hall-of-fame-26083400|title=Mick Foley to be inducted into WWE Hall of Fame|publisher=WWE|date=2013-01-11|access-date=2013-01-11}}</ref> and maintains a relatively successful circuit of stand-up comedy and speaking tours. He is also a New York Times best-selling novelist.\n\nAs the epilogue of the film mentioned, Funk's retirement lasted three months. Funk went on to participate in several more retirement matches, the most recent on September 22, 2017, at age 73.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/2013/01/12/terry-funk-finally-retired|title=Terry Funk Officially Retires|access-date=2013-01-12|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115065820/http://www.gerweck.net/2013/01/12/terry-funk-finally-retired/|archive-date=2013-01-15}}</ref> Along with his brother [[Dory Funk, Jr.]], Funk was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\nRoberts' drug and alcohol use increased after the film was released.
