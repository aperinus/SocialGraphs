Their post and supplies are delivered by a small [[steamboat]] named the ''[[African Queen (boat)|African Queen]]'', helmed by the rough-and-ready Canadian mechanic Charlie Allnut, whose coarse behavior they stiffly tolerate.\n\n[[File:The African Queen, Bogart.jpg|thumb]]\nWhen Charlie warns the Sayers that war has broken out between [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], they choose to remain in Kungdu, only to witness German [[Schutztruppe|colonial troops]] burn down the village and herd the villagers away to be pressed into service. When Samuel protests, he is struck by an officer and soon becomes delirious with [[fever]], dying shortly afterward. Charlie helps Rose bury her brother and they escape in the ''African Queen''.\n\nCharlie mentions to Rose that the British are unable to attack the Germans because of the presence of a large [[gunboat]], the {{lang|de|K\u00f6nigin Luise}}, patrolling a large lake downriver. Rose comes up with a plan to convert the ''African Queen'' into a [[torpedo boat]] and sink the {{lang|de|K\u00f6nigin Luise}}. After some persuasion, Charlie goes along with the plan.\n\nCharlie allows Rose to navigate the river by rudder while he tends the engine, and she is emboldened after they pass the first set of rapids with minimal flooding in the boat. When they pass the German fortress, the soldiers begin shooting at them, damaging the boiler. Charlie manages to reattach a pressure hose just as they are about to enter the second set of rapids. The boat rolls and pitches as it goes down the rapids, leading to more severe flooding on the deck. While celebrating their success, Charlie and Rose find themselves in an embrace and kiss. The third set of rapids damages the boat's propeller shaft. Rigging up a primitive forge on shore, Charlie straightens the shaft and welds a new blade onto the propeller, allowing the two to set off again.\n\n[[File:The African Queen, Hepburn2.jpg|thumb]]\nAll appears lost when the boat becomes mired in the mud and dense [[Reed (plant)|reeds]] near the mouth of the river. With no supplies left and short of [[potable water]], Rose and a feverish Charlie pass out, both accepting that they will soon die. Rose says a quiet prayer. As they sleep, torrential rains raise the river's level and float the ''African Queen'' into the lake.\n\nOver the next two days, Charlie and Rose prepare for their attack. The {{lang|de|K\u00f6nigin Luise}} returns and Charlie and Rose steam the ''African Queen'' out onto the lake in darkness, intending to set her on a [[collision course]]. A strong storm strikes, causing water to pour into the ''African Queen'' through the torpedo holes. Eventually the boat capsizes, throwing Charlie and Rose into the water. Charlie loses sight of Rose in the storm.\n\nCharlie is captured and taken aboard the ''K\u00f6nigin Luise'', where he is interrogated by German officers. Believing that Rose has drowned, he makes no attempt to defend himself against accusations of [[Espionage|spying]] and the German captain sentences him to death by [[hanging]]. Rose is brought aboard the ship just after Charlie's sentence is pronounced. The captain questions her, and Rose proudly confesses the plot to sink the ''K\u00f6nigin Luise'', deciding that they have nothing to lose. The captain sentences her to be executed with Charlie, both as British spies. Charlie asks the German captain to marry them before they are executed. The captain agrees, and after conducting the briefest of marriage ceremonies, is about to carry out the execution when the {{lang|de|K\u00f6nigin Luise}} is rocked by a series of explosions, quickly [[capsizing]]. The ship has struck the overturned submerged hull of the ''African Queen'' and detonated the torpedoes. The newly married couple is able to escape the sinking ship and swim to safety together.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Charlie Allnut\n* [[Katharine Hepburn]] as Rose Sayer\n* [[Robert Morley]] as Reverend Samuel Sayer, \"The Brother\"\n* [[Peter Bull]] as the Captain of the {{lang|de|K\u00f6nigin Luise}}\n* [[Theodore Bikel]] as the First Officer of the {{lang|de|K\u00f6nigin Luise}}\n* [[Walter Gotell]] as the Second Officer of the {{lang|de|K\u00f6nigin Luise}}\n* [[Peter Swanwick]] as the First Officer of Fort Shona\n* [[Richard Marner]] as the Second Officer of Fort Shona\n* Gerald Onn as Petty Officer of the {{lang|de|K\u00f6nigin Luise}} (uncredited)<ref>{{cite book |last1=McCarty |first1=Clifford |title=Bogey: The Films of Humphrey Bogart |year=1965 |publisher=Cadillac. |page=161}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Hepburn bogart african queen.png|thumb|Hepburn and Bogart in a publicity still for the film.]]\nProduction [[Film censorship in the United States|censors]] objected to several aspects of the original script, such as the two unmarried characters cohabiting the boat (as in the book), and some changes were made before the film was completed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://explore.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/show/censored/walkthrough/film1|title=University of Virginia Library Online Exhibits \u2013 CENSORED: Wielding the Red Pen|work=virginia.edu}}</ref> Another change followed the casting of Bogart; his character's lines in the original screenplay were rendered with a thick [[Cockney]] dialect, but the script had to be completely rewritten because he was unwilling to attempt the accent. The rewrite made the character Canadian.\n\nThe film was partially financed by [[John and James Woolf]] of Romulus Films, a British company. [[Michael Balcon]], an advisor to the [[National Film Finance Corporation]], advised the NFFC to refuse a loan to the Woolfs unless the film starred his former [[Ealing Studios]] actors [[John McCallum (actor)|John McCallum]] and [[Googie Withers]] rather than Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn, whom the Woolfs wanted. The Woolfs persuaded NFFC chairman [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Lord Reith]] to overrule Balcon, and the film went ahead.<ref>Sue Harper & Vincent Porter, British Cinema of the 1950s: The Decline of Deference, OUP, 2007, p.12</ref> The Woolfs provided \u00a3250,000 and were so pleased with the completed film that they convinced John Huston to direct their next picture, ''[[Moulin Rouge (1952 film)|Moulin Rouge]]'' (1952).<ref name=\"tino\">Tino Balio, ''United Artists: The Company That Changed the Film Industry'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1987 p. 46</ref>\n\nMuch of the film was shot on location in [[Uganda Protectorate|Uganda]] and the [[Belgian Congo|Congo]] in Africa. This was rather novel for the time, especially for a [[Technicolor]] picture that used large, cumbersome cameras. The cast and crew endured sickness and spartan living conditions during their time [[Location shooting|on location]]. In the early scene in which Hepburn plays an organ in the church, a bucket was placed off-camera in which she could vomit between takes because she was sick. Bogart later bragged that he and Huston were the only members of the cast and crew who escaped illness, which he credited to having drunk [[Whisky|whiskey]] on location rather than the [[Waterborne diseases|local water]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://africanqueenflkeys.com/history.html|title=History of the African Queen|author=Web Designer Express and Web Design Enterprise|work=The African Queen}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://life.time.com/icons/humphrey-bogart-katharine-hepburn-filming-the-african-queen-1951/#1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701022829/http://life.time.com/icons/humphrey-bogart-katharine-hepburn-filming-the-african-queen-1951/#1|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 1, 2013|title=Humphrey Bogart, Katharine Hepburn Filming 'The African Queen,' 1951|first=Ben |last=Cosgrove|work=time.com}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The African Queen - trailer.ogv|thumb|Film trailer]]\nAbout half of the film was shot in the [[UK]]. The scenes in which Bogart and Hepburn are seen in the water were all shot in studio tanks at [[Isleworth Studios]], [[Middlesex]]. These scenes were considered too dangerous to shoot in Africa. All of the foreground plates for the process shots were also filmed in studio.<ref>Embracing Chaos: Making \u2018The African Queen' a documentary film</ref> A myth has grown that the scenes in the reed-filled riverbank were filmed in [[Dalyan, Turkey]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043265/|title=The African Queen (1951)|author=Light Sword Of The Protector|date=20 February 1952|work=IMDb}}</ref> but in her book about the filming, Hepburn stated: \"We were about to head... back to [[Entebbe]] but John [Huston] wanted to get shots of Bogie and me in the miles of high reeds before we come out into the lake...\". The sequence was shot on location in Africa and at the London studios.\n\nScenes on the boat were filmed using a large raft with a [[mockup]] of the boat on top. Sections of the boat set could be removed to make room for the large Technicolor camera. This proved hazardous on one occasion when the boat's boiler, a heavy copper replica, almost fell on Hepburn. It was not secured to the deck because it also had to be moved to accommodate the camera. The small steamboat used to depict the ''African Queen'' was built in 1912 in Britain for service in Africa. At one time it was owned by actor [[Fess Parker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Interviews/Parker/interview_fess_parker.htm|title=MichaelBarrier.com -- Interviews: Fess Parker|work=michaelbarrier.com}}</ref> The boat was restored in April 2012 and is now on display as a [[tourist attraction]] in [[Key Largo]], [[Florida]].<ref>{{cite news|date=December 9, 2011|title=African Queen boat to be restored|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16108483}}</ref><ref name=\"CBS\">{{cite news | url=https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-57413816-10391698/the-african-queen-sets-sail-again/ | title=The African Queen sets sail again | date=April 13, 2012<!-- 3:23 PM -->| access-date=April 13, 2012 | work=CBS News}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the dangers involved with shooting the rapids scenes, a small-scale model was used in the studio tank in London.

S. Forester was published, many British people believed that World War I was a grievous mistake that could have been avoided. In the novella, the Germans are the antagonists, not the villains, and are depicted as noble and chivalrous opponents of the British, who are likewise equally noble and honorable.{{sfn|Barker|2017|p=231}} The overall message of the novella was that the war was a tragedy in which decent people killed one another for unfathomable reasons and that both sides suffered equally.{{sfn|Barker|2017|p=231}}\n\nHowever, when the film version of ''The African Queen'' was released in 1951, memories of World War II were still fresh and the film's German characters are far more villainous than they are in the novella.{{sfn|Barker|2017|p=235}} The common perception that World War II was a crusade against evil influenced the script of ''The African Queen''.{{sfn|Barker|2017|p=235}} In the novella, the Germans capture Rose and Charlie, but release them in a magnanimous gesture, unaware of their failed plot.{{sfn|Barker|2017|p=231}} In the film, Rose and Charlie are sentenced to death after their capture.{{sfn|Barker|2017|p=235}}\n\nIn the novella, Charlie and Rose fail in their attempt to sink the ''K\u00f6nigin Luise'',{{sfn|Barker|2017|p=231}} and it is instead sunk by a [[Royal Navy]] [[gunboat]] as Rose and Charlie watch from the shore.{{sfn|Barker|2017|p=231}} In the film, the ''African Queen'' causes the sinking of the ''K\u00f6nigin Luise'' \u2013 the Royal Navy gunboat does not appear in the movie.{{sfn|Barker|2017|p=235}}\n\n== Accolades ==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

An elliptic commentary on the making of ''The African Queen'' can be found in the 1990 film ''[[White Hunter Black Heart]]'', directed by [[Clint Eastwood]].\n\n''The African Queen'' partially inspired the [[Jungle Cruise]] attraction at [[Disneyland]]. [[Imagineering|Imagineer]] [[Harper Goff]] referenced the film frequently in his ideas, and his designs for the ride vehicles were inspired by the steamer used in the film.<ref>{{cite book|author=The Imagineers|title=Walt Disney Imagineering \u2013 A Behind the Dreams Look at Making the Magic Real|publisher=Disney Editions|year=1996|page=112}}</ref>\n\n== The ''African Queen'' ==\n{{main|African Queen (boat)}}\nThe boat used as the ''African Queen'' is actually the 35-foot (10 m) L.S. ''Livingston'', which had been a working diesel boat for 40 years; the steam engine was a prop and the real diesel engine was hidden under stacked crates of gin and other cargo. Florida attorney and Humphrey Bogart enthusiast Jim Hendricks Sr. purchased the boat in 1982 in Key Largo, Florida. After falling into a state of disrepair following Hendricks' 2001 death, the ship was discovered rusting in a Florida [[marina]] in 2012 by Suzanne Holmquist and her engineer husband Lance. The couple repaired and refurbished the ailing ship and made it available to tourists and film enthusiasts, providing cruises around the [[Florida Keys]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2012/04/30/showbiz/african-queen-bogart/index.html|title=Humphrey Bogart's boat 'African Queen' saved from scrapheap|last=Macguire|first=Eoghan|date=May 2, 2012|website=CNN}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n=== Specific ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|last=Barker|first=Anthony|pages=221\u2013239|chapter=African Queens and Ice-Cream Wars: Fictional and Filmic Versions of the East Africa Conflict, 1914-1918|title=Personal Narratives, Peripheral Theatres: Essays on the Great War (1914\u201318)|editor1-first=Maria Eug\u00e9nia|editor1-last=Pereira|editor2-first=Maria Teresa|editor2-last=Cortez|editor3-first=Paulo Alexandre|editor3-last=Pereira|editor4-first=Ot\u00edlia|editor4-last=Martins|publisher=Springer|location=New York|date=2017|isbn=9783319668512}}\n* [[Byron Farwell|Farwell, Byron]].
