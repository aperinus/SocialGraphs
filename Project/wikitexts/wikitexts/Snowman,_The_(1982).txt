It was first shown on 26 December 1982, and was an immediate success. It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]] at the [[55th Academy Awards]] and won a [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA TV Award]].\n\nThe story is told through pictures, action and music, scored by [[Howard Blake]], and is wordless, with the exception of the central song \"[[Walking in the Air]]\".

As a result, the experienced animator [[Jimmy T. Murakami]] was brought in to supervise.<ref name=bfi/> The film was produced using [[traditional animation]] techniques, consisting of pastels, crayons and other colouring tools drawn on pieces of celluloid, which were traced over hand drawn frames. For continuity purposes, the background artwork was painted using the same tools.<ref name=bfi/>\n\nThe story was expanded to fill 26 minutes and include a longer flying sequence which takes the boy to the North Pole and a party with Father Christmas which is not present in the picture book. The animators also brought in personal touches - a static sequence with a car is replaced by a motorcycle ride, as one of the animators was a keen motorcyclist and it was noted by Iain Harvey that this sequence kept \"the action flowing after all the fun and comedy of the boy and the Snowman exploring the house and forming a friendship \u2013 and what could be better than a midnight run in a snowy landscape\".<ref name=bfi/> Similarly, although the boy in the book is unnamed, in the film he is named \"James\" on his present tag, added by animator Joanna Harrison as it was her boyfriend's (later her husband) name.<ref name=bowie/><ref>Interview with Hilary Andus and Joanna Harrison in \"Snow Business\" included on the 2002 20th Anniversary DVD</ref> Interviewed in 2012, [[Raymond Briggs]] recalls that he thought \"'It's a bit corny and twee, dragging in Christmas', as ''The Snowman'' had nothing to do with that, but it worked extremely well.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-12-24/snowman-creator-raymond-briggs-grumpy-old-man-or-great-big-softie/|title=Snowman creator Raymond Briggs \u2013 grumpy old man or great big softie?|website=Radio Times|date=24 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe boy's home appears to be located in the [[South Downs]] of England, near to [[Brighton]]; he and Snowman fly over the [[Royal Pavilion]] and [[Brighton Palace Pier|Palace Pier]].

Snow had fallen steadily all night long and in the morning I woke in a room filled with light and silence, the whole world seemed to be held in a dream-like stillness. It was a magical day... and it was on that day I made The Snowman.\"'' - Raymond Briggs in the original introduction to the film.</blockquote>\n\nAfter a night of heavy snowfall, a boy wakes up and plays in the snow, eventually building a large snowman. At the stroke of midnight, he sneaks downstairs to find the snowman magically comes to life. James shows the snowman around his house, playing with appliances, toys and other [[Bric-\u00e0-brac|bric-a-brac]], all while keeping quiet enough not to wake James' parents. The two find a sheeted-down motorcycle in the house's garden and go for a ride on it through the woods. Its engine heat starts to melt the snowman and he cools off in the garage freezer.\n\nSeeing a picture of the arctic on a packet in the freezer, the snowman is agitated and takes the boy in hand, running through the garden until they take flight. They fly over the [[South Downs]] towards the coast, seeing the [[Royal Pavilion]] and [[Brighton Palace Pier]], and north along the coast of Norway. They continue through an arctic landscape and into the [[Aurora|aurora borealis]]. They land in a snow-covered forest where they join a party of snowmen. They eventually meet Father Christmas along with his reindeer; he gives the boy a card and a scarf with a snowman pattern. The snowman returns home with James before the sun rises and the two bid farewell for the night.\n\nThe following morning, James wakes up to find that the snowman has melted, leaving only his hat, scarf, coal eyes, tangerine nose, and coal buttons in a pile of melted snow. James kneels down by the snowman's remains while holding his scarf, mourning the loss of his friend.\n\n===Alternative introductions===\nThe original introduction on Channel 4 features the author [[Raymond Briggs]] walking through a field in rural Sussex describing his inspiration for the story, which then transitions into the animated landscape of the film. The film's executive producer Iain Harvey had received interest in the film from U.S. networks and for a VHS release. However, he noted that \"in the US programmes were sponsored, and to be sponsored you needed a big name\". Various names such as Sir [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Julie Andrews]] were suggested, but a request for a rock star led to [[David Bowie]] being involved. He was a fan of Briggs' story ''[[When the Wind Blows (comics)|When the Wind Blows]]'' and later provided a song for its [[When the Wind Blows (1986 film)|animated adaptation]]. In the sequence, Bowie was filmed in the attic of 'his' childhood home and discovering a scarf in a drawer closely resembling the one given to the boy towards the end of the film.<ref name=bowie>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/22/how-the-snowman-melted-david-bowies-heart-raymond-briggs|title=How The Snowman melted David Bowie's heart|website=The Guardian|date=22 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nTo celebrate the film's 20th anniversary, Channel 4 created an alternative opening directed by [[Roger Mainwood]], with [[Father Christmas (1991 film)|Raymond Briggs' interpretation of Father Christmas]] recounting how he met the boy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonhound.com/snowman.htm|title=The Snowman|website=Toonhound|date=23 November 2019}}</ref> Comedian [[Mel Smith]] reprises Father Christmas in this opening.
