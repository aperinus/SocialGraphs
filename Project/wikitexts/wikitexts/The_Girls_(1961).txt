A pig-tailed young girl, Tosya, arrives from school with a cooking degree, and joins a group of other women who work in jobs supporting the loggers. Tosya is assigned as a cook for the camp.\n\nOnce in her dorm-like room, she cheerfully prepares herself a meal of tea and a giant loaf of bread slathered with jam; all of it from her roommates' food stockpile. When the four other girls return after a day at work, they are generally taken by Tosya's youth and good nature. However, one woman is upset that she is eating her food without permission, and a fight ensues. When the dorm-mate makes some rude comments, Tosya throws a boot at her head without hesitation. Tosya and her roommates go to the dancehall together. At first, no one will dance with her, but eventually she begins to dance with another very tall girl who is also passed up by several young men.\n\nMeanwhile, two groups of loggers engage in a friendly dispute; one has just lost their position as the most productive in the camp, and their portraits are being taken down from a \"wall of honor\" by an official, who replaces them with pictures of the rival group. The leaders of the two groups play checkers, and in order to concentrate, Ilya, the leader of their group, calls out for the music to be turned off. A very tall and imposing companion carries out his order. However, Tosya, who is now enjoying her dance, marches over to the phonograph and puts the music back on. Ilya calls for the music to be turned back off, and Tosya, to the amusement of the onlookers, seems prepared to fight him in order to keep the music playing.<ref name=\"\u00ab\u0414\u0435\u0432\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0430\u00bb \u043d\u0430 vokrug.tv\"/><ref name=\"\u00ab\u0414\u0435\u0432\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0430\u00bb \u043d\u0430 7days.ru\"/>\n\nImpressed by Tosya's tenacity, Ilya approaches her and asks her to dance. After telling him to first throw away his cigarette and take off his hat, she proclaims that she doesn't want to dance with \"your type.\"\n\nFollowing this episode, Ilya bets with Filya, the leader of the rival group, that within a week he can win Tosya's heart. The winner gets the other's hat. Ilya and his gang quickly make a plan, they will first insult Tosya's cooking to break her down. They dramatically throw Tosya's stew into the snow, proclaiming it to be inedible, and bringing her to tears. Despite  the ill-treatment,  Tosya carries some mushroom soup to the men a few days later to their work-site in the forest. The starving men can no longer resist, and Ilya and Tosya begin to show some real affection for one another. We also learn that Tosya is an orphan and that Ilya is interested in exploring ways to increase the productivity of the logging operation through new techniques and technologies.\n\nOne night, Tosya's dorm-mate Anfisa reveals to the other girls the bet that Ilya has made, and there is a debate over whether to break the news to Tosya. The other girls want to keep Tosya's faith in men and love alive. When Ilya asks Tosya to a big dance, however, the girls decide that they must tell her the truth. It is a heartbreaking scene, especially when Tosya asks quietly, \"And the bet was just for a hat?\" Within minutes her despair turns to indignation, and she marches off to the dance. When they reach the dance, after she calls over Filya, she asks him point blank whether there was any bet, and when he sheepishly admits that there was, she grabs Filya's hat and shoves it into Ilya's hands. She then runs out into the night (without a coat) and sobs behind a wood pile as Ilya searches for her and calls out her name.\n\nIn the weeks that follow, Ilya attempts to convince her that the bet was just a stupid prank, that he is sorry, and that he really does love her. But Tosya will not be easily swayed.<ref name=\"\u00ab\u0414\u0435\u0432\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0430\u00bb \u043d\u0430 7days.ru\"/>\n\nEventually, though, during a scene in which the entire camp is pitching in to build a newly married couple their own house, Tosya and Ilya find themselves in an attic, each with a box of nails. This simple moment leads to their reconciliation, and we leave them snuggling outside on a log, flirtatiously exploring a first kiss and talking about their future.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\nWhen preparing for the film, [[Yuri Chulyukin]] promised the role of Tosya to his wife, [[Natalya Kustinskaya]]. Kustinskaya started to seriously prepare for the audition and waited for the decision from the artistic council. After a while she learned from a cinematographer with whom she was acquainted that the picture has already started shooting and that [[Nadezhda Rumyantseva]] is starring in the lead role. Chulyukin justified himself by saying that the artistic council considered Kustinskaya too beautiful for the character of Tosya, and as reconciliation offered her the role of Anfisa, but Kustinskaya refused.<ref name=\"\u00ab\u0414\u0435\u0432\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0430\u00bb \u043d\u0430 vokrug.tv\"/><ref name=\"\u00ab\u0414\u0435\u0432\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0430\u00bb \u043d\u0430 7days.ru\"/><ref>\u0416\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b \u00ab\u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044c\u044e\u00bb, \u2116 10, 2008 \u0433\u043e\u0434. \u0418\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u00ab\u041a\u0440\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u041c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0430\u00bb</ref> Tosya in the script is eighteen years old and at the time of filming Rumyantseva already turned thirty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1tv.ru/shows/segodnya-vecherom/vypuski/kak-snimali-film-devchata-segodnya-vecherom-vypusk-ot-22-03-2014|title=\u041a\u0430\u043a \u0441\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c \"\u0414\u0435\u0432\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0430\". \u0421\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043c. \u0412\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a \u043e\u0442 22.03.2014|publisher=Channel One Russia}}</ref> As planned by the director, on the screen Ilya looks much older than Tosya, but in real the actors Rybnikov and Rumyantseva are the same age.
