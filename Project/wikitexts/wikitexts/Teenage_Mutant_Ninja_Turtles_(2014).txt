At a dock at night, she sees the Foot raiding cargo containers. After an unseen [[vigilante]] attacks the thieves, April notices a symbol left behind. April's supervisor [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)#Other characters|Bernadette Thompson]] and her coworkers are oblivious to her story. Later while covering a charity event thrown by Sacks Industries, April expresses gratitude to the company's [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] Eric Sacks, who was her late father's lab partner.\n\nFrustrated by the vigilante, the Foot Clan's leader [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]] has the Foot Soldiers take hostages at subway station in order to draw him out. April, at the scene, becomes a hostage herself. Four mysterious figures arrive, take out the Clan, and free the hostages. April follows them to a rooftop and is shocked to see that the vigilantes are [[anthropomorphic]] mutant [[turtles]], causing her to pass out. When she regains consciousness, they advise her not to tell anyone of them. As they leave, April hears [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]] and [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]]'s names.\n\nApril returns to her apartment and remembers \"Project Renaissance\", her father's science experiment, which involved four turtles named [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]], [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]], [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]], and a mutated rat called [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]]. Unable to convince Bernadette of the Turtles' existence, April is dismissed. Her coworker [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)#Other characters|Vern Fenwick]] drives her to Sacks' estate where she confides in him about her discovery. Sacks believes her and reveals that he and April's father had been experimenting on a mutagen created to cure disease, which was thought lost in the fire that killed her dad.\n\nAt Splinter's behest, the Turtles bring April to their sewer lair. Splinter explains April had saved them all from the fire and free them into the sewer. The mutagen caused the five of them to grow and develop humanoid attributes. Splinter took on the role of their father, using April's father as an example. After finding a book on [[Ninjutsu]] in a storm drain, he proceeded to teach himself, then the Turtles, the fighting style. When April reveals she told Sacks about her discovery of the Turtles, Splinter informs her that Sacks was practically raised by the Shredder and works with him.\n\nThen, Shredder and the Foot Soldiers attack the lair, defeating Splinter and incapacitating Raphael while the other Turtles are captured. April comes out of hiding and she and Raphael plan to save the others. At Sacks' estate, he has the Turtles' blood drained in order to create an antidote to a deadly virus that Sacks hopes to flood New York with, believing he will become rich from people seeking his cure. Raphael, April, and Vern storm the estate and free the other Turtles. The group then escapes the compound in pursuit of Sacks.\n\nOn a radio tower in the city, Sacks and Shredder plant a device that will flood the city with the virus while Sacks is preparing to convert the mutagen into a healing serum. Sacks reveals to April that he killed her father. April and Vern subdue Sacks in the lab, while the Turtles are battling Shredder on the roof. During the fight, the tower's support beams collapse. As the turtles try to keep it from falling and infecting the city, April confronts Shredder with the mutagen. In the struggle, the tower collapses and the Turtles pull April onto it with them, while Shredder falls to the street and is captured by the police. Believing they are about to die, the Turtles confess their secrets, while Raphael gives an impassioned speech about his love for his brothers before they land harmlessly on the street. They vanish before the humans find them and return to the sewers, where they give Splinter the mutagen and he begins to recover.\n\nSometime later, April meets with Vern, who tries and fails to ask her on a date. The Turtles appear in a special modified \"Turtle Van\", and Michelangelo accidentally blows up Vern's new car with a rocket. As the police respond to the explosion, the Turtles leave, but not before Mikey tries to serenade April with \"[[Happy Together (song)|Happy Together]]\" by the band [[The Turtles]], much to his brothers' annoyance and April's amusement.\n\n==Cast==\n===Voice actors and Motion-capture===\n* [[Pete Ploszek]] (motion-capture) and [[Johnny Knoxville]] (voice) as [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], the leader of the Ninja Turtles.\n* [[Jeremy Howard (actor)|Jeremy Howard]] as [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]], the scientist of the Ninja Turtles.\n* [[Alan Ritchson]] as [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]], the aggressive member of the Ninja Turtles.\n* [[Noel Fisher]] as [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]], the childish member of the Ninja Turtles.\n* [[Danny Woodburn]] (motion-capture) and [[Tony Shalhoub]] (voice) as [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]], a mutant rat who is the adoptive father and sensei of the Ninja Turtles.\n\n===Live-action===\n* [[Megan Fox]] as [[April O'Neil]], a reporter for Channel 6 News.\n* [[Will Arnett]] as Vern Fenwick, April's co-worker.\n* [[William Fichtner]] as Eric Sacks, the CEO of Sacks Industries with ties to the Foot Clan.\n* [[Tohoru Masamune]] as [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|The Shredder]], the leader of the Foot Clan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/tmnt-2-shredder-brian-tee-1201480798/|title='Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2' Casts Brian Tee as Shredder|first=Laura|last=Prudom|date=April 27, 2015}}</ref><!-- Shredder's real name Oroku Saki is never mentioned in this film. -->\n* [[Whoopi Goldberg]] as Bernadette Thompson \n* [[Minae Noji]] as [[Karai (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Karai]], a member of the Foot Clan.<!-- It is unclear IN THIS FILM if Karai is indeed The Shredder's daughter. -->\n* [[Abby Elliott]] as Taylor, April's roommate.\n* [[Taran Killam]] as Jim McNaughton\n* [[K.

At first, Alan Ritchson was not sure about playing Raphael because he didn't want to play a [[motion-capture]] character, but the promise of being a star-making career move by the producers, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], and pleasing his son, a huge [[TMNT]] fan, convinced him to accept the part. The TMNT actors were then not given the same special treatments as their live-action co-stars [[Megan Fox]] and [[Will Arnett]] and often seemed to be mistreated and afterthought by most of the producers (including [[Michael Bay]]) and [[Paramount Pictures]] during and after filming of both movies, not even allowing many opportunities to do press for the picture and were not invited to the premiere as promised and instructed them to not give press interviews while claiming they (the turtles) were the ones refusing to give interviews but denying saying they wanted interviews. Ritchson personally emailed the late [[Brad Grey]] many times about the situation, Alan did not want to return as Raphael after having an unhappy experience making the first movie, but was bound by his contract to do so and then was promised it would not happen again on the sequel and then will be giving interviews for the film sequel and even made appearances at the film sequel's premieres, but nothing much changed during filming the sequel either.<ref>{{cite podcast |author=Collider Podcasts |title=Why Alan Ritchson HATED Filming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtlD90wM3No | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/xtlD90wM3No| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|publisher=Collider |via=[[YouTube]] |access-date=1 November 2020 }}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Rishma Dosani |title=Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles star admits he 'hated life' during filming |url=https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-star-admits-hated-life-filming-scathing-attack-11181352/ |website=Metro |date=19 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Actor Says Making Reboots Was 'the Worst Production Experience' |url=https://people.com/movies/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-actor-claims-production-was-worst-experience/ |website=PEOPLE.com}}</ref>\n\n===Visual effects===\nThe visual effects of ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' were handled by [[Industrial Light & Magic]], who had previously worked with Michael Bay and Nickelodeon before, doing the special effects for ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]'', the ''[[Transformers (film series)|Transformers]]'' film series, ''[[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'', ''[[The Spiderwick Chronicles (film)|The Spiderwick Chronicles]]'', ''[[The Last Airbender (2010 film)|The Last Airbender]]'', and also the animation for the 2011 film ''[[Rango (2011 film)|Rango]]''.
