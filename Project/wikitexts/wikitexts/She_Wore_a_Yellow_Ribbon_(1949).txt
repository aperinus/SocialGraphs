It is the second film in Ford's \"Cavalry Trilogy\", along with ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' (1948) and ''[[Rio Grande (1950 film)|Rio Grande]]'' (1950). With a budget of $1.6 million, the film was one of the most expensive Westerns made up to that time. It was a major hit for [[RKO Radio Pictures|RKO]]. The film is named after \"[[Yellow ribbon#\"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\"|She Wore a Yellow Ribbon]]\", a song popular with the [[US military]].\n\nThe film was shot on location in [[Monument Valley]] utilizing large areas of the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo reservation]] along the [[Arizona]]-[[Utah]] state border.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}} Ford and cinematographer [[Winton C. Hoch]] based much of the film's imagery on the paintings and sculptures of [[Frederic Remington]]. Hoch won the [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Academy Award for Best Cinematography, Color]] in [[22nd Academy Awards|1950]]. It was also nominated as 1950's Best Written American Western (which the [[Writers Guild of America]] awarded  to ''[[Yellow Sky]]'').\n\n==Plot==\nOn the verge of his retirement in 1876 at Fort Starke, a small Frontier Army post, aging cavalry veteran Nathan Cutting Brittles is given one last mission: to deal with a breakout by the [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] from their reservation following the defeat of [[George Armstrong Custer]] at the Battle of the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Little Big Horn]], and prevent a new [[American Indian Wars|frontier war]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nixon |first1=Rob |title=She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) |url=http://www.tcm.turner.com/tcmdb/title/89881/She-Wore-a-Yellow-Ribbon/articles.html |website=Turner Classic Movies |access-date=29 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702101139/http://www.tcm.turner.com/tcmdb/title/89881/She-Wore-a-Yellow-Ribbon/articles.html |archive-date=July 2, 2019}}</ref>\n[[Image:Nathan Brittles house.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Post Headquarters building, where Captain Brittles is quartered in the film, is located at [[Goulding's Trading Post]] near [[Monument Valley]].

His troop officers, [[1st Lieutenant|1st Lt.]] Flint Cohill and [[Second lieutenant|2nd Lt.]] Ross Pennell, meanwhile, vie for the affections of Olivia while uneasily anticipating the retirement of their captain and mentor.\n[[File:She Wore a Yellow Ribbon trailer 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dru as Olivia and Wayne as Captain Brittles]]\n\nAssisting Capt. Brittles with his mission is his chief scout, Sgt. Tyree, a one-time Confederate captain of cavalry; his first sergeant, Quincannon; and Maj. Allshard, Brittles's long-time friend and commanding officer.\n\nAfter apparently failing in both missions, Brittles returns with the troop to Fort Starke to retire. His lieutenants continue the mission in the field, joined by Brittles after \"quitting the post and the Army\". Unwilling to see more lives needlessly taken, Brittles takes it upon himself to try to make peace with his old friend Chief Pony That Walks. When that too fails, he devises a risky stratagem to avoid a bloody war by stampeding the renegades' horses out of their camp, forcing them to return to their reservation.\n\nBrittles is recalled to duty as Chief of Scouts with the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lt. Colonel]]\u2014a [[U.S. War Department]] order endorsed, he is pleased to see, by Gens. [[Phil Sheridan]] and [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], and by President [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Olivia and Lt.

However, he knew that he did not want John Wayne for the part\u2014considering, among other factors, that Wayne would be playing a character over twenty years older than he was at the time. Reportedly, Wayne's 1948 performance in [[Red River (1948 film)|''Red River'']] changed Ford's mind, causing him to exclaim, \"I didn\u2019t know the big son of a bitch could act!\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nixon |first1=Rob |title=Red River |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/12472 |website=Turner Classic Movies |access-date=29 November 2021 |date=November 15, 2002}}</ref> Ford realized Wayne had grown considerably as an actor, and was now capable of playing the character he envisaged for this film.

Most slept in dirt-floor cabins that only had communal cold-water drum showers. The film was completed ahead of schedule and under budget.\n\nAlthough the film's cinematographer, Winton Hoch, won an Academy Award for his work, filming was not a smooth creative process because of conflicts with Ford. Ironically one of the most iconic scenes from the film was created during a dispute. As a line of cavalry rode through the desert, a real thunderstorm grew on the horizon. Hoch began to pack up the cameras as the weather worsened only for Ford to order him to keep shooting. Hoch argued that there was not enough natural light for the scene and, more importantly, the cameras could become potential [[lightning rod]]s if the storm swept over them. Ford ignored Hoch's complaints; completing the scene as the thunderstorm rolled in, soaking the cast and crew. Hoch later had filed a letter of complaint against Ford with the American Society of Cinematographers over the filming of this scene.<ref name=AFI/>\n\nThe story of Hoch's refusal to shoot in this thunderstorm has often been repeated, but actor [[Harry Carey, Jr.]], who was on the set, contests it.<ref name=\"Carey\">{{Cite book |title=Company of heroes : my life as an actor in the John Ford stock company |last=Carey |first=Harry Jr. |publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing |year=2013 |isbn=978-1589799103 |edition=First Taylor Trade |location=Lanham, Maryland |pages=67 |oclc=847602806}}</ref><ref name=hoch>{{Cite book |title=Three Bad Men: John Ford, John Wayne, Ward Bond |last=Nollen |first=Scott Allen |publisher=McFarland |year=2013 |isbn=978-0786458547 |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |pages=190\u2013191 |oclc=810122531}}</ref> He says Ford had finished shooting for the day, but when the picturesque storm brewed he asked Hoch if they could shoot in the declining light. Hoch answered, \"It's awfully dark, Jack. I'll shoot it. I just can't promise anything.\" Ford then instructed, \"Winnie, open her up [the camera lens] and let's go for it. If it doesn't turn out, I'll take the rap.\" Winnie complied, saying, \"Fair enough, Jack.\"<ref name=\"Carey\" />\n\nThis was the second John Ford movie filmed in [[Technicolor]].
