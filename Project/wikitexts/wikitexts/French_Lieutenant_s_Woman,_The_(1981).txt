It is based on ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'', a 1969 novel by [[John Fowles]]. The music score is by [[Carl Davis]] and the cinematography by [[Freddie Francis]].\n\nThe film stars [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Jeremy Irons]]. Other featured actors include [[Hilton McRae]], [[Peter Vaughan]], [[Colin Jeavons]], [[Liz Smith (actress)|Liz Smith]], [[Patience Collier]], [[Richard Griffiths]], [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]], [[Alun Armstrong (actor)|Alun Armstrong]], [[Penelope Wilton]], and [[Leo McKern]].\n\nThe film received five [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations. Streep was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], and Pinter for the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film intercuts the stories of two romantic affairs. One is within a Victorian period drama involving a gentleman [[Paleontology|palaeontologist]], Charles Smithson, and the complex and troubled Sarah Woodruff, known as \"the French lieutenant's woman\". The other affair is between the actors Mike and Anna, playing the lead roles in a modern filming of the story. In both segments, [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Meryl Streep]] play the lead roles.\n\nJohn Fowles's ''The French Lieutenant's Woman'' had multiple endings, and the two parallel stories in the movie have different outcomes. In the Victorian story, Charles enters into an intensely emotional relationship with Sarah, an enigmatic and self-imposed exile he meets just after becoming engaged to Ernestina ([[Lynsey Baxter]]), a rich merchant's daughter in [[Lyme Regis]]. Charles and Sarah meet secretly in the Lyme Regis Undercliff and eventually have sex in an Exeter hotel.\n\nThis leads to Charles's breaking his engagement, but then Sarah disappears. In social disgrace after being sued for breach of promise by Ernestina, Charles searches for Sarah, fearing she has become a prostitute in London. After three years, Sarah, who has a job as a governess in the [[Lake District]], contacts Charles to explain that she needed time to find herself. Despite Charles's initial anger, he forgives her, and the two are reconciled. They are finally seen boating on [[Windermere]].\n\nIn the modern story, the American actress Anna and the English actor Mike, both married, are shown as having an extended affair during the making of the Victorian film, in which Anna plays Sarah and Mike portrays Charles. As filming concludes, Mike wishes to continue the relationship, but Anna becomes increasingly cool about the affair and avoids Mike in favour of spending time with her French husband. During the film's [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrap]] party, Anna leaves without saying goodbye to Mike. Mike calls to Anna, using her character's name Sarah, from an upstairs window on the set where Charles and Sarah reconciled, as she drives away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Miss Sarah Woodruff / Mrs. Roughwood and Anna\n* [[Jeremy Irons]] as Charles Henry Smithson and Mike \n* [[Hilton McRae]] as Sam \n* Emily Morgan as Mary \n* [[Charlotte Mitchell]] as Mrs. Tranter\n* [[Lynsey Baxter]] as Miss Ernestina Freeman\n* Jean Faulds as Cook\n* [[Peter Vaughan]] as Mr. Ernest Freeman\n* [[Colin Jeavons]] as Vicar\n* [[Liz Smith (actress)|Liz Smith]] as Mrs. Fairley\n* [[Patience Collier]] as Mrs. Poulteney\n* [[John Barrett (actor)|John Barrett]] as Dairyman\n* [[Leo McKern]] as Dr. Grogan\n* [[Penelope Wilton]] as Sonia\n* [[Alun Armstrong]] as Grimes\n* [[:fr:G\u00e9rard Falconetti|G\u00e9rard Falconetti]] as Davide\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production notes==\nHarold Pinter and Karel Reisz worked on the script in 1979, with [[Leon Clore]] as producer, and with whom Reisz regularly worked in their company Film Contracts, formed many years earlier. Leon had produced Reisz' ''[[Morgan: A Suitable Case for Treatment]]''. The film was shot in 1980 on location in Lyme Regis, Dartmouth, Exeter, London docks, and Lake Windermere. Studio sets were built at Twickenham Studios in London to Assheton Gorton's period-perfect designs. The opening shot in the film establishes the dual stories by having the assistant director mark the shot with a clapper board, and then run out of the shot to reveal the Victorian seaside front, with Charles and Ernestina taking the air.\n\nThe audience is given alternating sequences of a rigid Victorian society, and the more relaxed modern life of a working film crew, revealing the great moral divide between past and present. ''[[Prostitution, Considered in Its Moral, Social, and Sanitary Aspects]]'', an 1857 book by [[William Acton (doctor)|William Acton]], is referred to in the film when Streep's character mentions that in 1857 there were 80,000 prostitutes in the county of London and that one house in 60 functioned as a brothel.{{Sfn|Gale|p=245}}\n\nThe book was published in 1969. Its transfer to the big screen was a protracted process, with film rights changing hands a number of times before a treatment, funds and cast were finalized. Originally, [[Malcolm Bradbury]] and [[Christopher Bigsby]] approached Fowles to suggest a television adaptation, to which Fowles was amenable, but the producer [[Saul Zaentz]] finally arranged for the film version to be made.\n\nA number of directors were attached to the film: [[Sidney Lumet]], [[Robert Bolt]], [[Fred Zinnemann]] and [[Milo\u0161 Forman]]. The script went through a number of treatments, including one by [[Dennis Potter]] in 1975 and by James Costigan in 1976, before Pinter's final draft.\n\nActors considered for the role of Charles Smithson/Mike included [[Robert Redford]] and [[Richard Chamberlain]], and Sarah/Anna included [[Francesca Annis]], [[Charlotte Rampling]], [[Gemma Jones]] and Fowles's choice [[Helen Mirren]].<ref>{{Cite journal |first=John |last=Fowles |author-link=John Fowles |title=The French Lieutenant's Diary |journal=Granta|issue=Granta 86: Film |date=2004 |isbn=0-903141-69-8 |oclc=237843976}}</ref>\n\nThe award-winning music was composed by [[Carl Davis]] and performed by an unidentified orchestra and viola soloist Kenneth Essex.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the [[Chicago Sun-Times]] gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it \"a beautiful film to look at, and remarkably well-acted\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-french-lieutenants-woman-1981 |title=The French Lieutenant's Woman movie review |last=Ebert |first=Roger |website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |access-date=January 29, 2019 }}</ref> [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it \"an astonishingly beautiful film, acted to the elegant hilt by Meryl Streep as the ultimately unreliable Sarah; Jeremy Irons, who looks a lot like the young [[Laurence Olivier]] of ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'', as Charles Smithson, and by a cast of splendid supporting actors of the sort that only England seems to possess.\"<ref>Canby, Vincent, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/18/movies/the-french-lieutenant-s-woman.html \"Screen: 'The French Lieutenant's Woman{{'\"}}], ''[[The New York Times]]'',18 September 1981, C4.</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, \"The effect of the two interwoven stories is at time irritating and confusing, but ultimately most affecting.
