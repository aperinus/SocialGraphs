The film received mixed reviews from critics, earning praise for Jolie's performance, the costumes, visual effects and musical score, while criticism was aimed at the script and some inconsistencies in tone. ''Maleficent'' was a commercial success, grossing over $758&nbsp;million worldwide, and became the [[2014 in film#Highest-grossing films|fourth-highest-grossing film of 2014]], as well as Jolie's highest-grossing film.

As child, Maleficent meets and falls in love with a human [[peasant]] boy named [[List of Disney's Sleeping Beauty characters#King Stefan|Stefan]]. On Maleficent's 16th birthday, he gives her what he calls a true love's kiss. However, as they grow older, the two grow apart; Stefan's love is overshadowed by his ambition to be king, and Maleficent becomes protector of the Moors.\n\nWhen King Henry tries to conquer the Moors, Maleficent mortally wounds him, forcing his retreat. As he lies dying, he declares that whoever kills Maleficent will be named his successor and marry his daughter. Stefan calls on Maleficent in the Moors; he drugs her, but cannot bring himself to kill her. Instead, he amputates her wings, presents them to Henry as 'proof' of Maleficent's death, and is named the new King. While still processing the betrayal, Maleficent turns [[Diablo (Disney)|Diaval]], a trapped raven, into a human, frightening away his captors. He promises to serve her, and  brings her news of the humans. Infuriated when she learns why her wings were taken, Maleficent, and the Moors she controls, become bitter and dark.\n\nAfter some time, Diaval informs Maleficent that King Stefan's newborn daughter, [[Aurora (Sleeping Beauty)|Aurora]], is being [[Baptism|christened]]. Maleficent arrives uninvited and curses the infant princess; on her 16th birthday, she will prick her finger on the [[spinning wheel|spindle of a spinning wheel]] and fall into an eternal sleep. Maleficent mocks Stefan's plea for mercy, but offers an antidote; the curse can be broken by true love's kiss, something she and Stefan both believe does not exist. \n\nStefan orders [[Flora, Fauna and Merryweather|three pixie-fairies]] to hide and protect Aurora until the day after her 16th birthday and destroys every spinning wheel in the kingdom, hiding their remnants in the castle [[dungeon]]. Stefan sends his armies to find and kill Maleficent, but she surrounds the Moors with an impenetrable wall of thorns, protecting it. Over the years, Stefan obsesses over killing Maleficent and gradually loses his sanity, even refusing to see his own wife on her deathbed. \n\nMaleficent and Diaval watch Aurora grow from afar and secretly begin to take over Aurora's care from the bumbling and neglectful pixies. After encountering Maleficent face-to-face several times, Aurora names Maleficent \"[[fairy godmother]]\". Maleficent realizes she hasn't the heart to hurt Aurora, and privately attempts to revoke the curse, forgetting that she stated \"no power on earth\" can revoke it. Meanwhile, in the forest, Aurora meets a young [[Prince Phillip (Disney)|Prince Phillip]], and both are mildly attracted to each other.\n\nOn the day before Aurora's 16th birthday, Aurora gains Maleficent's permission to live in the Moors. When Aurora informs the pixies of this, they reveal the truth about Aurora's lineage and the curse. Angrily accusing Maleficent of being evil, Aurora runs to her father's castle. Instead of welcoming Aurora, Stefan locks her in a room while plotting to kill Maleficent. The curse's power draws Aurora to the dungeon, where she pricks her finger on a spindle and falls into a deep sleep. Maleficent, intent on saving her, abducts Phillip and infiltrates Stefan's castle. The pixies encourage the reluctant Phillip to kiss Aurora, but this does not wake her. After Philip leaves, Maleficent tearfully apologizes to Aurora and kisses her on the forehead. This unexpectedly awakens Aurora, as Maleficent truly feels maternal love for her.\n\nAs Maleficent and Aurora attempt to leave, Stefan and his guards ambush them. Maleficent transforms Diaval into a dragon to help her, but both are subdued. Meanwhile, Aurora finds Maleficent's caged wings and releases them. They fly to Maleficent and reattach themselves, but Stefan continues fighting. Maleficent carries him to the top of the highest tower; unwilling to kill him, she announces the fight is over and tries to leave him there. He tackles her from behind, dragging them both off the tower. Maleficent opens her wings to save herself, causing Stefan to lose hold and fall to his death.\n\nWith King Stefan gone, Maleficent returns the Moors to its former glory, and gives away her position to Aurora, who is crowned queen of the Moors, uniting the two kingdoms. Phillip also comes to visit them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = \n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width = 500\n| image1    = Angelina Jolie 2 June 2014 (cropped).jpg\n| caption1  =\n| image3    = Elle_Fanning_2019_by_Glenn_Francis.jpg\n| caption2  =\n| image2    =  Juno Temple at Sundance 2011.jpg\n| caption3  =\n| image4    = SharltoCopleyCCJuly09.jpg\n| caption4  = \n| image5    = Sam Riley Das finstere Tal Wien 2014 (cropped).jpg\n| caption5  =\n| footer    = [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Juno Temple]], [[Elle Fanning]], [[Sharlto Copley]] and [[Sam Riley]] \n}}\n*[[Angelina Jolie]] as [[Maleficent]], [[fairy]]-queen of the Moors.

It allows her to reclaim the story\".<ref>{{cite news| last1=Krischer| first1=Hayley| title=The Maleficent Rape Scene That We Need to Talk About| url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/hayley-krischer/the-maleficent-rape-scene_b_5445974.html?ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000046| access-date=June 10, 2014| newspaper=HuffPost| date=June 6, 2014}}</ref> Monika Bartyzel of ''[[The Weekly Standard|The Week]]'' noted the scene's implications in her review: \"In its first act, ''Maleficent'' offers a dark, surprisingly adult exploration of rape and female [[mutilation]]\".\n\nHowever, Bartyzel went on to opine that the film portrayed Maleficent's actions as \"a [[Rape and revenge film|rape revenge fantasy]]\" and criticized the film for not following through on its early subtext, ultimately calling it less feminist and reductive compared to its 1959 counterpart: \"In ''Maleficent'', Aurora is the product of a cold and loveless marriage and a vengeful, unhinged rapist. Her safety relies on a trio of clueless and dangerously careless fairies, and her Godmother is the woman who cursed her\u2014and who had, in turn, been violated by her own father\".<ref>{{cite news| last1=Bartyzel| first1=Monika| title=Girls on Film: Maleficent is less progressive than 1959's Sleeping Beauty| url=https://theweek.com/article/index/262679/girls-on-film-maleficent-is-less-progressive-than-1959s-sleeping-beauty#axzz34ATYF2dp| access-date=June 10, 2014| date=June 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAngelina Jolie addressed the issue during an interview with BBC Radio 4 on the ''[[Woman's Hour]]'' programme and claimed that the subtext was intentional: \"The question was asked: 'What could make a woman become so dark and lose all sense of her maternity, her womanhood, and her softness?' ... We were very conscious, the writer and I, that [the scene] was a metaphor for rape\". She further explained that the answer to the question \"What could bring her back?\" was still \"an extreme ''Disney'', fun version [of the story]\", but \"at the core it is abuse, and how the abused then have a choice of abusing others or overcoming and remaining loving, open people\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bahadur| first1=Nina| title=Angelina Jolie: 'Maleficent' Scene Is A 'Metaphor For Rape'| url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/11/angelina-jolie-maleficent-rape-scene_n_5485633.html| access-date=June 20, 2014| work=HuffPost| date=June 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| last1=Holmes| first1=Sally| title=Angelina Jolie Says Violent Maleficent Scene Was a Metaphor for Rape|url=http://www.elle.com/news/culture/angelina-jolie-maleficent-scene-metaphor-for-rape|access-date=June 20, 2014| work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]| date=June 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Capitalism and socialism===\nJordan Shapiro of ''[[Forbes]]'' argued that the film's main subtext was the detrimental effects of ultimata between [[Capitalism|capitalist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] societies. He pointed out that the Moors represented a socialist, nature-oriented, democratic society, while the human kingdom was one of capitalism, industry, and [[absolute monarchy]]. Shapiro further commented that the character of Stefan, his theft of the Moors' riches (the jewel), and his mutilation of Maleficent's wings for the sake of his ambition were references to the [[American Dream]].\n\nHe conceived the wing-tearing scene as \"a social commentary that any hierarchical rise to power inherently happens through the exploitation of others\", explaining that it was the reason why \"without her wings, Maleficent also becomes an oppressive ruler of the Moors. Everything she represents, believes, and stands for has been grounded\", and \"like most victims of oppression\", \"she takes it out on those who are smaller and weaker\". He concluded that through the merge of the two kingdoms at the end of the film, it sought to weave together capitalism and socialism and let go oppositions: \"It is time to leave the kingdom of familiar partisan oppositions: let's replace ''either/or'' with ''neither/nor'' or ''both/and''\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shapiro|first1=Jordan|title=Why Disney's 'Maleficent' Matters|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jordanshapiro/2014/06/05/why-disneys-maleficent-matters|access-date=June 10, 2014|work=Forbes|date=June 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=4 style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | List of awards and nominations\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\" width=\"40%\"| Award / Film Festival\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\" width=\"30%\"| Category\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\" width=\"25%\"| Recipient(s)\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\" width=\"15%\"| Result\n|- style=\"border-top:2px solid gray;\"\n|-\n| [[87th Academy Awards]]<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Labrecque|first1=Jeff|title=Oscars 2015: Full list of nominations|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2015/01/15/oscars-2015-nominations/|access-date=January 15, 2015|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|date=January 15, 2015}}</ref>\n| [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]\n| [[Anna B.
