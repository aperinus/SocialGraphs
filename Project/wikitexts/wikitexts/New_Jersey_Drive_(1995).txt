But he later set his sights on Newark after reading about teenagers and joyriding in several articles by [[The New York Times]]. In an on-location interview, he stated that he himself used to steal cars for Joyrides as a teenager in a working-class neighborhood in Boston, where he previously lived.\n\nUpon seeking permission to shoot the film in the city of Newark itself, city officials would not give permission to film in the city limits. Therefore, locations in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and Glendale, [[Queens, New York]] were chosen. Ironically, director Gomez stated that even if he had been granted permission, he still would have shot some scenes in Brooklyn since it was more conveniently located near his home and film studio in Manhattan.\n\nFilming commenced in late March 1994 and concluded on May 16 of that year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/18/nyregion/guarding-image-newark-city-bars-local-filming-movie-about-teen-age-car-bandits.html|title = Guarding the Image in Newark; City Bars Local Filming of a Movie About Teen-Age Car Bandits|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 18 April 1994|last1 = Levy|first1 = Clifford J.}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a rating of 64% from 14 reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/new_jersey_drive | title=New Jersey Drive | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of hood films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0113967}}\n*[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=newjerseydrive.htm New Jersey Drive]. boxofficemojo.com\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|new_jersey_drive}}\n\n{{Nick Gomez}}\n\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1995 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:American crime drama films]]\n[[Category:Hood films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Nick Gomez]]\n[[Category:40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks films]]\n[[Category:Films set in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Culture of Newark, New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Gramercy Pictures films]]\n[[Category:African-American films]]\n[[Category:Films about automobiles]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
