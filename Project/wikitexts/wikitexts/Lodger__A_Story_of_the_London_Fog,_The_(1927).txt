Hitchcock's third feature film, it was released on 14 February 1927 in London and on 10 June 1928 in New York City. The film is based on the 1913 novel ''[[The Lodger (novel)|The Lodger]]'' by [[Marie Belloc Lowndes]] and the play ''Who Is He?'' co-written by Belloc Lowndes. Its plot concerns the hunt for a [[Jack the Ripper]]-like [[serial killer]] in London.<ref name=HitchcockGuide/>\n\nHitchcock's first thriller, the film established him as a name director.<ref name=\"Lodger BFI\"/> Upon its release the trade journal ''Bioscope'' wrote: \"It is possible that this film is the finest British production ever made\".<ref name=\"Lodger BFI\">{{cite news |title=Lodger, The: A Story of the London Fog (1926) |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/438120/index.html |access-date=13 July 2022 |work=BFI}}</ref> It also saw Hitchcock make his first [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|cameo appearances]] in a film; he was depicted sitting in a newsroom, and in the second, standing in a crowd as the leading man is arrested.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide-the-lodger-a-story-of-the-london-fog-1926 |title=Alfred Hitchcock Collectors' Guide: The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1926) |publisher=Brenton Film |access-date=30 August 2019 |date=23 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191222033129/https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide-the-lodger-a-story-of-the-london-fog-1926|archive-date=22 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA young blonde woman screams. She is the seventh victim of a serial killer known as the Avenger, who targets young blonde women on Tuesday evenings.\n\nThat night, blonde model Daisy Bunting is at a fashion show when she and the other showgirls hear the news. The blonde girls are horrified, hiding their hair with dark wigs or hats. Daisy returns home to her parents and her policeman sweetheart Joe, who have been reading about the crime in the newspaper.\n\nA handsome but secretive young man bearing a strong resemblance to the description of the murderer arrives at the Bunting house and asks about their room for rent. Mrs. Bunting shows him the room, which is decorated with portraits of beautiful young blonde women. He pays her a month's rent in advance. The lodger turns all the portraits around to face the wall and requests that they be removed. Daisy enters to remove the portraits and is attracted to the lodger. The women return downstairs, where they hear the lodger's heavy footsteps as he paces the floor.\n\nThe relationship between Daisy and the reclusive lodger gradually becomes serious, making Joe, who is newly assigned to the Avenger case, unhappy. Mrs. Bunting is awoken late at night by the lodger leaving the house. She attempts to search his room, but a small cabinet is locked tight. In the morning, another blonde girl is found dead, just around the corner.\n\nThe police observe that the murders are moving towards the Buntings' neighbourhood. The Buntings believe that the lodger is the Avenger, and they try to prevent Daisy spending time with him. The next Tuesday night, Daisy and the lodger sneak away for a late-night date. Joe tracks them down and confronts them, and Daisy breaks up with him. Joe begins to piece together the events of the previous weeks and convinces himself that the lodger is indeed the Avenger.\n\nWith a warrant and two fellow officers, Joe returns to search the lodger's room. They find a leather bag containing a gun, a map plotting the location of the murders, newspaper clippings about the attacks and a photograph of a beautiful blonde woman, whom Joe recognizes as the Avenger's first victim. The lodger is arrested despite Daisy's protests, but he manages to run off into the night. Daisy finds him handcuffed, coatless and shivering. He explains that the woman in the photograph was his sister, a beautiful debutante murdered by the Avenger at a dance, and that he had vowed to his dying mother that he would bring the killer to justice.\n\nDaisy takes the lodger to a pub and gives him brandy to warm him, hiding his handcuffs with a cloak. The suspicious locals pursue them, quickly becoming a mob. The lodger is surrounded and beaten, while Daisy and Joe, who have just heard that the real Avenger has been caught, try in vain to defend him. When all seems lost, a paperboy interrupts with the news that the real Avenger has been arrested. The mob releases the lodger, who falls into Daisy's waiting arms. Some time later, the lodger is shown to have fully recovered from his injuries and he and Daisy are happily living together.\n\n==Hitchcock's common themes==\n''The Lodger'' continues the themes of Hitchcock's previous and future works;<ref name=HitchcockGuide/> according to Phillip French, writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Hitchcock borders themes of \"the fascination with technique and problem-solving, the obsession with blondes, the fear of authority, the ambivalence towards homosexuality\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/12/the-lodger-hitchcock-review-sawhney ''The Guardian'': \"The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog \u2013 review\"]</ref> in ''The Lodger''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Marie Ault]] as The Landlady (Mrs. Bunting)\n* [[Arthur Chesney]] as Her Husband (Mr. Bunting)\n* [[June Tripp]] as Daisy Bunting, a Model\n* [[Malcolm Keen]] as Joe Chandler\n* [[Ivor Novello]] as Jonathan Drew (The Lodger)\n* [[Eve Gray]] as Showgirl Victim (uncredited)\n* [[Alfred Hitchcock]] as Extra in newspaper office, man in angry mob (uncredited)\n* [[Reginald Gardiner]] as Dancer at Ball (uncredited)\n* [[Alma Reville]] as Woman Listening to Wireless (uncredited)\n\nAlfred Hitchcock's [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|cameo]] occurs when he is sitting at a desk in the newsroom with his back to the camera and operating a telephone (5:33 minutes into the film). This is Hitchcock's first recognisable film cameo, and it became a standard practice for the remainder of his films.<ref name=\"screen\"/> Hitchcock said that his cameo came about because the actor who was supposed to play the part of the telephone operator failed to appear, so Hitchcock filled in for him. Film scholar [[William Rothman]] notes that Hitchcock's cameo from behind is shot in a very similar manner to that of the titular lodger.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/28001-the-lodger-a-story-of-the-london-fog|title = The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog}}</ref><ref name=\"William Rothman on 'Lodger' 2017\">William Rothman on 'Lodger' (2017)</ref> According to some sources, including [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], Hitchcock makes another cameo at the very end of the film in the angry mob, but this has been disputed.<ref name=\"William Rothman on 'Lodger' 2017\"/><ref>{{cite web| url = https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/The_Lodger_(1927)_-_Hitchcock%27s_cameo| title = The Lodger (1927) - Hitchcock's cameo - The Alfred Hitchcock Wiki}}</ref>\n\n== Pre-production ==\n''The Lodger'' is based on a novel of the same name by [[Marie Adelaide Lowndes|Marie Belloc Lowndes]] about the [[Jack the Ripper]] murders, as well as the play ''Who Is He?'', a comic stage adaptation of the novel by [[Horace Annesley Vachell]] that Hitchcock saw in 1915.<ref name=HitchcockGuide/><ref>{{cite book|last=Spoto|first=Donald|title=The Dark Side of Genius: The Life of Alfred Hitchcock| publisher=Da Capo|year=1999|page=[https://archive.org/details/darksideofgenius00spot_0/page/84 84]|isbn=0-306-80932-X|url-access =registration|url=https://archive.org/details/darksideofgenius00spot_0/page/84}}</ref>\n\nNews of the film was announced by the British press at the start of 1926 and [[Ivor Novello]] was announced as the lead in February.\n\nOriginally, the film was to end with ambiguity as to the lodger's innocence. However, when Novello was cast, the studio demanded alterations to the script. Hitchcock recalled:<ref name=\"imdb\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017075/trivia IMDB trivia]</ref><ref name=\"spotot85\">Spoto, Donald pg. 85</ref>\n<blockquote>They wouldn't let Novello even be considered as a villain. The publicity angle carried the day, and we had to change the script to show that without a doubt he was innocent.<ref name=\"spotot85\"/></blockquote>\nUltimately, Hitchcock followed these instructions, but avoided showing the true villain.<ref name=\"spotot85\"/>\n\n[[File:The Lodger A Story of the London Fog Still.jpg|thumb|Still from the film]]\n\n==Principal photography==\nFilming began on 25 February 1926 and principal photography was completed within six weeks. Because Hitchcock practised film methods that mirrored those of [[German Expressionism (cinema)|German expressionism]], scenes would not run for much longer than three minutes each. According to actress June Tripp: \"Fresh from Berlin, Hitch was so imbued with the value of unusual camera angles and lighting effects with which to create and sustain dramatic suspense that often a scene which would not run for more than three minutes on the screen would take a morning to shoot.\"<ref>Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness and Light (2003) by Patrick McGilligan</ref>\n\n===Directorial style and cinematography===\nIn framing the shots, Hitchcock was heavily influenced by post-war horror, social unrest and the emotional fear of abnormality and madness. The film is entirely silent, but words were not necessary given the visual method of storytelling.\n\nA memorable scene occurs when the Buntings look up at their kitchen ceiling, listening to the lodger pacing above. The ceiling then becomes transparent and the lodger is then seen walking on it (a thick sheet of toughened glass was used).<ref>[https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/The_Lodger:_A_Story_of_the_London_Fog_(1927) The Hitchcock Zone: ''The Lodger'']</ref> According to the [[Criterion Collection]] review by Phillip Kemp, this scene was composed of \"sixty-five shots in just over six minutes, with no title cards to interrupt. Some disconcerting camera angles, including one straight down the staircase as we see the lodger\u2019s disembodied hand sliding down the banister.\"<ref>[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/4688-the-lodger-a-story-of-the-london-fog-the-first-true-hitchcock-movie Criterion Collection essay]</ref>\n\nEarly in the film, the lodger's room is shown filled with paintings by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] of nude blonde women who resemble the Avenger's victims, but among them is a painting of [[Saint George]] freeing a woman from being sacrificed; this may be Hitchcock's use of [[foreshadowing]] to suggest that the lodger is not the actual killer.<ref name=\"William Rothman on 'Lodger' 2017\"/>\n\n[[File:Ivor Novello Publicity Still.jpg|thumb|Publicity still of Ivor Novello]]\n\n==Post-production==\nUpon viewing Hitchcock's finished film, producer [[Michael Balcon]] was reportedly furious and nearly shelved it. After considerable argument, a compromise was reached and film critic [[Ivor Montagu]] was hired to salvage the film. Hitchcock was initially resentful of the intrusion, but Montagu recognised the director's technical skill and artistry and made only minor suggestions, mostly concerning the title cards and the reshooting of a few minor scenes.<ref>Spoto, Donald pgs. 88\u201389</ref>\n\nHitchcock scholar [[Donald Spoto]], who had not viewed the director's earlier two films, described ''The Lodger'' as \"the first time Hitchcock has revealed his psychological attraction to the association between sex and murder, between ecstasy and death.\"<ref>Spoto, Donald pg. 91</ref> Spoto also stated: \"Montagu's claim that Hitchcock's edit contained up to 500 intertitles seems likely an exaggeration, but he worked with the director during the summer months to tighten up the film. One of the other improvements was to hire American poster artist [[Edward McKnight Kauffer]] to design the animated triangular title cards.\"\n\nA successful trade screening of the reedited film overcame Woolf's prior objections and its theatrical success allowed for the British release of Hitchcock's prior film, ''[[The Mountain Eagle]]''.<ref name=HitchcockGuide/>\n\n==Significance and legacy==\nUpon release, the film was a critical and commercial success. In a review of the film in the British trade journal ''Bioscope'', it was called \"the finest British production ever made.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Lodger A story of The London Fog|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6af1296e|website=bfi}}</ref> On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 96% based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 7.70/10.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Lodger (1927)|url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1044925-lodger|website=Rotten tomatoes}}</ref>\n\n''The Lodger'' continued themes that would run through much of Hitchcock's later work, such as that of an innocent man on the run for a crime that he did not commit. Hitchcock had reportedly studied contemporary films by [[F.W. Murnau|Murnau]] and [[Fritz Lang|Lang]],<ref name=\"screen\">[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/438120/index.html Lodger, The: A Story of the London Fog] (1926) at the [[British Film Institute]]'s [[Screenonline]]</ref><ref>Spoto, Donald pg. 86</ref> whose influence may be seen in the ominous camera angles and claustrophobic lighting. While Hitchcock had made two previous films, in later years the director would refer to ''The Lodger'' as the first true \"Hitchcock film.\"<ref>Richard Allen and Sam Ishii-Gonzales ''Alfred Hitchcock Centenary Essays'' pg. iv</ref> Beginning with ''The Lodger'', Hitchcock helped shape the modern-day [[Thriller film|thriller]] genre in film.<ref name=\"findmeanauthor.com\">{{cite web|author=Steve Bennett|url=http://www.findmeanauthor.com/thriller_fiction_genre.htm|title=Thriller Fiction Genre definition|publisher=Findmeanauthor.com|access-date=22 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter arriving in the United States in 1940, Hitchcock was involved with a radio adaptation of the film with [[Herbert Marshall]], [[Edmund Gwenn]] and [[Lurene Tuttle]].<ref name=HitchcockGuide/> In its review of the adaptation, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote: \"Hitchcock is a director with an exceptionally acute ear. He achieves his results by a Ravel-like rhythmic pummelling of the nervous system. Music, sound effects, the various equivalents of squeaking shoes, deep breathing, disembodied voices are mingled in the telling of the tale with a mounting accumulation of small descriptive touches that pyramid the tension.\"<ref>[https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/Variety_(1940)_-_Radio_Reviews:_The_Lodger ''Variety'': \"Radio Reviews: The Lodger (1940)\"]</ref> The adaptation preserves the original novel's ending rather than that of the film and does not resolve the question of the lodger's identity as the killer.\n\nIn early 1942, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Hitchcock was considering a colour remake of ''The Lodger'' following the completion of ''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942), but he was unable to obtain the film rights.\"<ref>\"News Clips From Studio Town\" in Los Angeles Times (19/Jan/1942)</ref>\n\nMany consider ''The Lodger'' to be Hitchcock's greatest silent film.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andrew Pulver|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jul/30/my-favourite-hitchcock-the-lodger|title=My favourite Hitchcock: The Lodger|work=The Guardian|date=30 July 2012|access-date=2 April 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Phillip Kemp|url= https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/4688-the-lodger-a-story-of-the-london-fog-the-first-true-hitchcock-movie|title=The Lodger: The First True Hitchcock|publisher=Criterion|access-date=2 April 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Donald Liebenson|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/features/quiet-mastery-hitchcocks-early-films|title=Quiet Mastery: Hitchcock's Early Films|publisher=Roger Ebert.com|access-date=2 April 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Samuel Wigley|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/news/then-now-lodger-reviewed|title=Then and Now: The Lodger Reviewed|publisher=BFI|access-date=2 April 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Preservation and home video status==\nIn commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Hitchcock's birth, an orchestral soundtrack was composed by [[Ashley Irwin]].
