The film stars [[Marcello Mastroianni]] as Marcello Rubini, a tabloid journalist who, over seven days and nights, journeys through the \"sweet life\" of [[Rome]] in a fruitless search for love and happiness. The screenplay, written by Fellini and three other screenwriters, can be divided into a [[prologue]], seven major episodes interrupted by an intermezzo, and an [[epilogue]], according to the most common interpretation.<ref name=\":0\">Cf.

The news helicopter is momentarily sidetracked by a group of bikini-clad women sunbathing on the rooftop of a high-rise apartment building. Hovering above, Marcello uses gestures to elicit phone numbers from them but fails in his attempt, then shrugs and continues following the statue to [[Saint Peter's Square]].\n\n===Episode 1===\n''1st Night Sequence'': Marcello meets Maddalena by chance in an exclusive nightclub. A beautiful and wealthy heiress, Maddalena is tired of Rome, while Marcello finds it suits him. They make love in the bedroom of a prostitute whom they had given a ride home in Maddalena's Cadillac.\n\n''1st Dawn Sequence'': Marcello returns to his apartment to find that his fianc\u00e9e, Emma, has overdosed. On the way to the hospital, he declares his everlasting love to her and again as she lies in a semiconscious state in the emergency room. While waiting frantically for her recovery, however, he tries to make a phone call to Maddalena.\n\n===Episode 2===\n''2nd Day Sequence'': That day, he goes on assignment for the arrival of Sylvia, a famous Swedish-American actress, at [[Rome Ciampino Airport|Ciampino airport]] where she is met by a horde of news reporters.\n\nDuring Sylvia's press conference, Marcello calls home to ensure Emma has taken her medication while reassuring her that he is not alone with Sylvia. After the film star confidently replies to the barrage of journalists' questions, her boyfriend Robert enters the room late and drunk.  To Sylvia's producer, Marcello casually recommends that Sylvia be taken on a tour of St Peter's.\n\nInside St Peter's dome, a news reporter complains that Sylvia is \"an elevator\" because none of them can match her energetic climb up the numerous flights of stairs. Inspired, Marcello maneuvers forward to be alone with her when they finally reach the balcony overlooking [[St. Peter's Square]].\n\n''2nd Night Sequence'': That evening, the infatuated Marcello dances with Sylvia in the [[Baths of Caracalla]]. Sylvia's natural sensuality triggers raucous partying while Robert, her bored fianc\u00e9, draws caricatures and reads a newspaper. His humiliating remark to her causes Sylvia to leave the group, eagerly followed by Marcello and his paparazzi colleagues. Finding themselves alone, Marcello and Sylvia spend the rest of the evening in the alleys of Rome, where they wade into the [[Trevi Fountain]].\n\n''2nd Dawn Sequence'': Like a magic spell that has suddenly been broken, dawn arrives at the very moment Sylvia playfully \"anoints\" Marcello's head with fountain water. They drive back to Sylvia's hotel to find an enraged Robert waiting for her in his car. Robert slaps Sylvia, orders her to go to bed, and then assaults Marcello, who takes it in stride.\n\n===Episode 3===\n''3rd Day Sequence'': Marcello meets Steiner, his distinguished intellectual friend, inside a church.  Steiner shows off his book of [[Sanskrit]] grammar. The two go up to play the organ, offering up a jazz piece for the watching priest before playing [[Bach]].\n\n===Episode 4===\n''3rd Day Sequence'': Late afternoon, Marcello, his photographer friend Paparazzo, and Emma drive to the outskirts of Rome to cover the story of the purported sighting of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Madonna]] by two children. Although the Catholic Church is officially skeptical, a huge crowd of devotees and reporters gathers at the site.\n\n''3rd Night Sequence'': That night, the event is broadcast over Italian radio and television. Emma prays to the [[Virgin Mary]] to be given sole possession of Marcello's heart.  Blindly following the two children from corner to corner in a downpour, the crowd tears a small tree apart for its branches and leaves said to have sheltered the Madonna.\n\n''3rd Dawn Sequence'': The gathering ends at dawn with the crowd mourning a sick child, a pilgrim brought by his mother to be healed, but trampled to death in the melee.\n\n===Episode 3b===\n''4th Night Sequence'': One evening, Marcello and Emma attend a gathering at Steiner's luxurious home where they are introduced to a group of intellectuals who recite poetry, strum the guitar, offer philosophical ideas, and listen to sounds of nature recorded on tape. The British poet [[Iris Tree]], whose poetry Marcello has read and admired, recommends that Marcello avoid the \"prisons\" of commitment: \"Stay free, available, like me.  Never get married.  Never choose.  Even in love, it's better to be chosen.\" Emma appears enchanted with Steiner's home and children, telling Marcello that one day he will have a home like Steiner's, but he turns away moodily.\n\nOutside on the terrace, Marcello confesses to Steiner his admiration for all he stands for, but Steiner admits he is torn between the security that a materialistic life affords and his longing for a more spiritual albeit insecure way of life. Steiner philosophizes about the need for love in the world and fears what his children may grow up to face one day.\n\n===Intermezzo===\n''5th Day Sequence'': Marcello spends the afternoon working on his novel at a seaside restaurant where he meets Paola, a young waitress from Perugia playing [[Perez Prado]]'s cha-cha \u201c[[Patricia (Perez Prado song)|Patricia]]\u201d on the jukebox and then humming its tune. He asks her if she has a boyfriend, then describes her as an angel in Umbrian paintings.\n\n===Episode 5===\n''5th Night Sequence'': Marcello meets his father visiting Rome on the [[Via Veneto]]. With Paparazzo, they go to the \"Cha-Cha\" Club, where Marcello introduces his father to Fanny, a beautiful dancer and one of his past girlfriends (he had promised to get her picture in the paper, but failed to do it). Fanny takes a liking to his father. Marcello tells Paparazzo that as a child he had never seen much of his father, who would spend weeks away from home. Fanny invites Marcello's father back to her flat, and two other dancers invite the two younger men to go with them.  Marcello leaves the others when they get to the dancers' neighborhood. Fanny comes out of her house, upset that Marcello's father has become ill.\n\n''5th Dawn Sequence'': Marcello's father has suffered what seems to be a mild heart attack.  Marcello wants him to stay with him in Rome so they can get to know each other, but his father, weakened, wants to go home, and gets in a taxi to catch the first train to [[Cesena]].  He leaves Marcello forlorn, on the street, watching the taxi leave.\n\n===Episode 6===\n''6th Night Sequence'': Marcello, [[Nico]], and other friends meet on the Via Veneto and are driven to a castle owned by aristocrats at [[Bassano di Sutri]] outside Rome. There is already a party long in progress, and the party-goers are bleary-eyed and intoxicated.  By chance, Marcello meets Maddalena again. The two of them explore a suite of ruins annexed to the castle. Maddalena seats Marcello in a vast room and then closets herself in another room connected by an [[echo chamber]]. As a disembodied voice, Maddalena asks him to marry her; Marcello professes his love for her, avoiding answering her proposal.  Another man kisses and embraces Maddalena, who loses interest in Marcello. He rejoins the group, and eventually spends the night with Jane, a British artist and heiress.\n\n''6th Dawn Sequence'': Burnt out and bleary-eyed, the group returns at dawn to the main section of the castle, to be met by the matriarch of the castle, who is on her way to mass, accompanied by priests in a procession.\n\n===Episode 3c===\n''7th Night Sequence'': Marcello and Emma are alone in his sports car on an isolated road. Emma starts an argument by professing her love, and tries to get out of the car; Marcello pleads with her not to get out.  Emma says that Marcello will never find another woman who loves him the way she does. Marcello becomes enraged, telling her that he cannot live with her smothering, maternal love.  He now wants her to get out of the car, but she refuses.  With some violence (a bite from her and a slap from him), he throws her out of the car and drives off, leaving her alone on a deserted road at night. Hours later, Emma hears his car returning as she picks flowers by the roadside. She gets into the car with neither of them saying a word.\n\n''7th Dawn Sequence'': Marcello and Emma are asleep in bed, tenderly intertwined; Marcello receives a phone call. He rushes to the Steiners' apartment and learns that Steiner has killed his two children and himself.\n\n''8th Day Sequence'': After waiting with the police for Steiner's wife to return home, he meets her outside to break the terrible news while the paparazzi swarm around her snapping pictures.\n\n===Episode 7===\n''8th Night Sequence'': An unspecified amount of time later, an older Marcello\u2014now with gray in his hair\u2014and a group of partygoers break into a [[Fregene]] beach house owned by Riccardo, a friend of Marcello's. Many of the men are [[homosexual]]. Marcello is mocked for abandoning literature and reporting to become a publicity agent. To celebrate her recent divorce from Riccardo, Nadia performs a [[striptease]] to [[Perez Prado]]'s cha-cha \u201c[[Patricia (Perez Prado song)|Patricia]]\u201d. Riccardo shows up at the house and tells the partiers to leave.  The drunken Marcello attempts to provoke the other partygoers into an orgy. However, their inebriation causes the party to descend into mayhem with Marcello riding a young woman crawling on her hands and knees and throwing pillow feathers around the room.\n\n===Epilogue===\n''8th Dawn Sequence'': The party proceeds to the beach at dawn where they find a modern-day [[leviathan]], a bloated, sea ray-like creature, caught in the fishermen's nets.{{efn|The fish is not specified in the film script nor identified by critics or biographers. Set designer Piero Gherardi described his creation as \"a kind of huge beast with blobs of plaster all over it like veal tripe. For eyes I gave it convex enlarging lenses\".<ref>Alpert, 141. Cf. Kezich, 204-205 and Bondanella, 144</ref>}} In his stupor, Marcello comments on how its eyes stare even in death.\n\n''9th Day Sequence'': Paola, the adolescent waitress from the seaside restaurant in Fregene, calls to Marcello from across an estuary but the words they exchange are lost on the wind, drowned out by the crashing waves. He signals his inability to understand what she is saying or interpret her gestures. He shrugs and returns to the partygoers; one of the women joins him and they hold hands as they walk away from the beach. In a long final close-up, Paola waves to Marcello then stands watching him with an enigmatic smile.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Marcello Mastroianni]] as Marcello Rubini\n* [[Anita Ekberg]] as Sylvia Rank\n* [[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]] as Maddalena\n* [[Yvonne Furneaux]] as Emma\n* [[Lex Barker]] as Robert\n* [[Magali No\u00ebl]] as Fanny\n* [[Alain Cuny]] as Steiner\n* [[Nadia Gray]] as Nadia\n* [[Jacques Sernas]] as Divo\n* [[Laura Betti]] as Laura\n* [[Walter Santesso]] as Paparazzo\n* [[Valeria Ciangottini]] as Paola\n* [[Riccardo Garrone (actor)|Riccardo Garrone]] as Riccardo\n* [[Annibale Ninchi]] as Marcello's father\n* [[Ida Galli]] as Debutante of the Year\n* Audrey McDonald as Jane\n* Alain Dijon as Frankie Stout\n* [[Enzo Cerusico]] as News Photographer\n* {{ill|Gi\u00f2 Stajano|it}} as Pierone\n* [[Giulio Questi]] as Don Giulio Mascalchi\n* [[Sondra Lee]] as Ballerina\n* {{ill|Dominot|fr}} as Drag Queen\n* [[Ferdinand Guillaume]] as Pagliaccio\n* [[Oretta Fiume]] as Lisa\n* [[Harriet White Medin]] as Edna\n* [[John Francis Lane]] as John\n* [[Umberto Orsini]] as Man in Shades\n* [[Archie Savage]] as Dancer\n* [[Nico]] as Herself\n* [[Adriano Celentano]] as Himself\n* [[Iris Tree]] as Herself\n* [[Desmond O'Grady]] as Himself\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Costumes===\nIn various interviews, Fellini said that the film's initial inspiration was the fashionable ladies' sack dress because of what the dress could hide beneath it.<ref>Pettigrew, 57.</ref> Brunello Rondi, Fellini's co-screenwriter and long-time collaborator, confirmed this view explaining that \"the fashion of women's sack dresses which possessed that sense of luxurious butterflying out around a body that might be physically beautiful but not morally so; these sack dresses struck Fellini because they rendered a woman very gorgeous who could, instead, be a skeleton of squalor and solitude inside.\"<ref>Bondanella, Peter, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini'', 134</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nCredit for the creation of Steiner, the intellectual who commits suicide after shooting his two children, goes to co-screenwriter [[Tullio Pinelli]].

On November 4, 1977 in an interview on [[The Dick Cavett Show]], Mastroianni recalled their first encounter. According to Mastroianni, Fellini told him that the producer wanted Paul Newman for the lead role, but that Fellini considered Newman too beautiful, while Mastroianni was \"the face of normal.\"<ref name=\":2\">Cavett, Dick (host) (4 November 1977). \u201cSophia Loren & Marcello Mastroianni\u201d.

Set designer [[Piero Gherardi]] created over eighty locations, including the [[Via Veneto]], the [[St. Peter's Basilica|dome of Saint Peter's]] with the staircase leading up to it, and various nightclubs.<ref>Fellini, 67-83.</ref> However, other sequences were shot on location such as the party at the aristocrats' castle filmed in the real [[Bassano Romano|Bassano di Sutri]] palace north of Rome. (Some of the servants, waiters, and guests were played by real aristocrats.) Fellini combined constructed sets with location shots, depending on script requirements\u2014a real location often \"gave birth to the modified scene and, consequently, the newly constructed set.\"<ref>Bondanella, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini'', 142</ref> The film's last scenes where the monster fish is pulled out of the sea and Marcello waves goodbye to Paola (the teenage \"Umbrian angel\") were shot on location at Passo Oscuro, a small resort town situated on the Italian coast 30 kilometers from Rome.{{efn|The feature documentary, ''[[Fellini: I'm a Born Liar]]'', shows many of these real locations used throughout the director's films.}}\n\nFellini scrapped a major sequence that would have involved the relationship of Marcello with Dolores, an older writer living in a tower, to be played by 1930s [[Academy Award]]-winning actress [[Luise Rainer]].<ref>Kezich, 199</ref> If the director's dealings with Rainer \"who used to involve Fellini in futile discussion\" were problematic, biographer Kezich argues that while rewriting the screenplay, the Dolores character grew \"hyperbolic\" and Fellini decided to jettison \"the entire story line.\"<ref>Kezich, 199, 241</ref>\n\nThe scene in the [[Trevi Fountain]] was shot over a week in winter: in March according to the BBC,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7925032.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - La Dolce Vita, 50 years and counting|work=bbc.co.uk|date=5 March 2009|access-date=14 March 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913044932/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7925032.stm|archive-date=13 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in late January according to Anita Ekberg.<ref>Interview with Anita Ekberg by Roberta Licurgo included in 2004 DVD edition of ''La Dolce Vita''.</ref> Fellini claimed that Ekberg stood in the cold water in her dress for hours without any trouble while Mastroianni had to wear a wetsuit beneath his clothes - to no avail.

Marcello faces the existential struggle of having to choose between two lives, depicted by journalism and literature. Marcello leads a lifestyle of excess, fame and pleasure amongst Rome's thriving popular culture, depicting the confusion and frequency with which Marcello gets distracted by women and power. A more sensitive Marcello aspires to become a writer, of leading an intellectual life amongst the elites, the poets, writers and philosophers of the time. Marcello eventually chooses neither journalism, nor literature. Thematically he opted for the life of excess and popularity by officially becoming a publicity agent.\n\nThe theme of the film \"is predominantly [[caf\u00e9 society]], the diverse and glittery world rebuilt upon the ruins and poverty\" of the Italian postwar period.<ref name=\"Kezich, 203\"/> In the opening sequence, a plaster statue of [[Christ|Jesus]] the Labourer suspended by cables from a helicopter, flies past the ruins of an ancient Roman aqueduct.{{efn|The aqueduct can be seen from the railway south of [[Roma Termini railway station|Termini]] station in Rome or by visiting the [[Parco degli Acquedotti]].}} The statue is being taken to the Pope at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. Journalist Marcello and a photographer named Paparazzo follow in a second helicopter. The symbolism of Jesus, arms outstretched as if blessing all of Rome as it flies overhead, is soon replaced by the profane life and neo-modern architecture of the \"new\" Rome, founded on the economic miracle of the late 1950s. (Much of this was filmed in [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] or in [[EUR (Rome)|EUR]], the Mussolini-style area south of Rome.) The delivery of the statue is the first of many scenes placing religious icons in the midst of characters demonstrating their \"modern\" morality, influenced by the booming economy and the emerging mass-consumer life.\n\n===Seven episodes===\nThe most common interpretation of the film is a mosaic, its parts linked by the protagonist, Marcello Rubini, a journalist.<ref>Bondanella, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini'', 143</ref> The seven episodes are:\n\n# Marcello's evening with the heiress Maddalena ([[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]])\n# His long, frustrating night with the American actress Sylvia ([[Anita Ekberg]]) that ends in the Trevi fountain at dawn\n# His reunion with the intellectual Steiner ([[Alain Cuny]]) their relationship is divided into three sequences spread over the film: a) the encounter, b) Steiner's party and c) Steiner's tragedy\n# The fake miracle\n# His father's visit/Steiner's Party\n# The aristocrat's party/Steiner's tragedy\n# The \"[[orgy]]\" at the beach house<ref>\"At a villa on the coast near Fregene, Marcello presides over what passed for an \"orgy\" in 1959.\" Bondanella, 144</ref>\n\nInterrupting the seven episodes is the restaurant sequence with the angelic Paola; they are framed by a prologue (Jesus over Rome) and epilogue (the monster fish) giving the film its innovative and symmetrically symbolic structure.<ref name=\"Kezich, 203\"/> The evocations are: seven deadly sins, seven sacraments, seven virtues, seven days of creation. Other critics disagree, Peter Bondanella argues that \"any critic of ''La Dolce Vita'' not mesmerized by the magic number seven will find it almost impossible to organize the numerous sequences on a strictly numerological basis\".<ref>Bondanella, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini'', 145</ref>\n\n===An aesthetic of disparity===\nThe critic Robert Richardson suggests that the originality of ''La Dolce Vita'' lies in a new form of film narrative that mines \"an aesthetic of disparity\".<ref>Richardson, Robert, 'Waste Lands: The Breakdown of Order' in Bondanella (ed.), ''Federico Fellini: Essays in Criticism'', 111</ref> Abandoning traditional plot and conventional \"character development\", Fellini and co-screenwriters [[Ennio Flaiano]] and [[Tullio Pinelli]] forged a cinematic narrative that rejected continuity, unnecessary explanations and narrative logic in favour of seven non-linear encounters between Marcello, a kind of [[Inferno (Dante)|Dantesque Pilgrim]] and an underworld of 120 characters. The encounters build up a cumulative impression on the viewer that finds resolution in an \"overpowering sense of the disparity between what life has been or could be, and what it actually is\".<ref>Richardson, 'Waste Lands: The Breakdown of Order', 111.</ref>\n\nIn a device used earlier in his films, Fellini orders the disparate succession of sequences as movements from evening to dawn. Also employed as an ordering device is the image of a downward spiral that Marcello sets in motion when descending the first of several staircases (including ladders) that open and close episodes. The upshot is that the film's aesthetic form, rather than its content, embodies the theme of Rome as a moral wasteland.\n\n==Critical reception==\nWriting for ''[[L'Espresso]]'', the Italian novelist [[Alberto Moravia]] highlighted the film's variations in tone,\n\n{{blockquote|Highly expressive throughout, Fellini seems to change the tone according to the subject matter of each episode, ranging from [[expressionist]] caricature to pure [[Neorealism (art)|neo-realism]]. In general, the tendency to caricature is greater the more severe the film's moral judgement although this is never totally contemptuous, there being always a touch of complacence and participation, as in the final orgy scene or the episode at the aristocrats' castle outside Rome, the latter being particularly effective for its descriptive acuteness and narrative rhythm.<ref>Moravia's review first published in ''L'Espresso'' (Rome), 14 February 1960. Fava and Vigano, p. 104</ref>}}\n\nIn ''Filmcritica XI'', Italian poet and film director [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] argued that \"''La Dolce Vita'' was too important to be discussed as one would normally discuss a film.\n\n{{blockquote|Though not as great as [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]], [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] or [[Kenji Mizoguchi|Mizoguchi]], Fellini is unquestionably an author rather than a director. The film is therefore his and his alone... The camera moves and fixes the image in such a way as to create a sort of diaphragm around each object, thus making the object\u2019s relationship to the world appear as irrational and magical. As each new episode begins, the camera is already in motion using complicated movements. Frequently, however, these sinuous movements are brutally punctuated by a very simple documentary shot, like a quotation written in everyday language.<ref>Pasolini's review first published in ''Filmcritica XI'' (Rome), February 1960. In Fava and Vigano, 104\u2013105</ref>}}\n\nJacques Doniol-Valcroze, film critic and co-founder of ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', felt that\n\n{{blockquote|\"what ''La Dolce Vita'' lacks is the structure of a masterpiece. In fact, the film has no proper structure: it is a succession of cinematic moments, some more convincing than others\u2026 In the face of criticism, ''La Dolce Vita'' disintegrates, leaving behind little more than a sequence of events with no common denominator linking them into a meaningful whole\".<ref>Doniol-Valcroze's review first published in ''France observateur'' (Paris), 19 May 1960. In Fava and Vigano, p. 104</ref>}}\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' film critic [[Bosley Crowther]] praised Fellini\u2019s\n\n{{blockquote|brilliantly graphic estimation of a whole swath of society in sad decay and, eventually, a withering commentary on the tragedy of the over-civilized\u2026 Fellini is nothing if not fertile, fierce and urbane in calculating the social scene around him and packing it onto the screen. He has an uncanny eye for finding the offbeat and grotesque incident, the gross and bizarre occurrence that exposes a glaring irony. He has, too, a splendid sense of balance and a deliciously sardonic wit that not only guided his cameras but also affected the writing of the script. In sum, it is an awesome picture, licentious in content but moral and vastly sophisticated in its attitude and what it says.<ref>Crowther\u2019s review first published in ''The New York Times'', 20 April 1961. In Fava and Vigano, p. 105</ref>}}\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] considered ''La Dolce Vita'' as Fellini\u2019s best film, as well as his favorite film of all, and listed it consistently in his top ten films for the ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' Greatest Films poll every ten years.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=What's Your Favorite Movie|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/whats-your-favorite-movie|website=RogerEbert.com|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|access-date=28 May 2016|date=4 September 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603212732/http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/whats-your-favorite-movie|archive-date=3 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Ten Greatest Films of All Time|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/ten-greatest-films-of-all-time|website=RogerEbert.com|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|access-date=28 May 2016|date=1 April 1991|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525133957/http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/ten-greatest-films-of-all-time|archive-date=25 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/voter/142|title=Roger Ebert|work=bfi.org.uk|access-date=14 March 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122022952/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/voter/142|archive-date=22 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Ebert's first review for the film, published in October 1961, was nearly the first film review he wrote, before he began his career as a film critic in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=La Dolce Vita Movie Review & Film Summary (1960)|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/la-dolce-vita|website=RogerEbert.com|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|access-date=28 May 2016|date=4 October 1961|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612112023/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/la-dolce-vita|archive-date=12 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The film was a touchstone for Ebert, as his perspective on the movie and his life evolved over time, summarized in his 1997 ''[[The Great Movies|Great Movie]]'' review:\n\n{{blockquote|Movies do not change, but their viewers do. When I saw \"La Dolce Vita\" in 1960, I was an adolescent for whom \"the sweet life\" represented everything I dreamed of: sin, exotic European glamour, the weary romance of the cynical newspaperman. When I saw it again, around 1970, I was living in a version of Marcello's world; Chicago's North Avenue was not the Via Veneto, but at 3 a.m. the denizens were just as colorful, and I was about Marcello's age. When I saw the movie around 1980, Marcello was the same age, but I was 10 years older, had stopped drinking, and saw him not as a role model but as a victim, condemned to an endless search for happiness that could never be found, not that way. By 1991, when I analyzed the film a frame at a time at the University of Colorado, Marcello seemed younger still, and while I had once admired and then criticized him, now I pitied and loved him. And when I saw the movie right after Mastroianni died, I thought that Fellini and Marcello had taken a moment of discovery and made it immortal.<ref name=\"Ebert-Great Movies\">{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=La Dolce Vita Movie Review & Film Summary (1960)|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-la-dolce-vita-1960|publisher=RogerEbert.com|access-date=28 May 2016|date=5 January 1997|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601150749/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-la-dolce-vita-1960|archive-date=1 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]] of [[Los Angeles Times]] wrote\n\n{{blockquote|Federico Fellini\u2019s 1960 \u201cLa Dolce Vita\" is one of the key works of the modern cinema.
