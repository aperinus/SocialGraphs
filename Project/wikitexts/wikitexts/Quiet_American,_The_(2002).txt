It is directed by [[Phillip Noyce]] and stars [[Michael Caine]], [[Brendan Fraser]], and [[Do Thi Hai Yen]].\n\nThe 2002 version of ''The Quiet American'', in contrast to the [[The Quiet American (1958 film)|1958 film version]], depicted Greene's original ending and treatment of the principal American character, Pyle. Like the novel, the film illustrates Pyle's moral culpability in arranging terrorist actions aimed at the French colonial government and the [[Viet Minh]]. Going beyond Greene's original work, the film used a montage ending with superimposed images of American soldiers from the intervening decades of the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n[[Miramax]] paid $5.5 million for the rights to distribute the film in North America and some other territories, but it shelved the film for a year due to the [[September 11 attacks]] and the film's \"unpatriotic\" message.<ref name=\"thompson\">{{cite news|last1=Thompson|first1=Anne|title=Films With War Themes Are Victims of Bad Timing|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/17/movies/films-with-war-themes-are-victims-of-bad-timing.html|work=The New York Times|date=17 October 2002|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121105210019/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/17/movies/films-with-war-themes-are-victims-of-bad-timing.html |archive-date = November 5, 2012 |url-status = live}}</ref> The film finally received an [[Oscar bait|Oscar qualification release]] in November 2002 and went on to gross US$12.9 million in limited theatrical release in the United States. The film received positive reviews from critics and Caine was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is set in 1952 in [[Saigon]], [[Vietnam]] ([[French Indochina]] at that time), toward the end of the [[First Indochina War]] (1946\u20131954) in which French forces fought the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist]]-led [[Viet Minh]] rebels. On one level, ''The Quiet American'' is a love story about the [[love triangle|triangle]] that develops between Thomas Fowler, a British journalist in his fifties; a young American idealist, supposedly an aid worker, named Alden Pyle; and Phuong, a Vietnamese woman. On another level it is also about the growing American involvement that led to the full-scale [[Vietnam War|American war in Vietnam]].\n\nThomas Fowler, who narrates the story, is involved in the war only as a reporter, an unengaged observer, apart from one crucial event. Pyle, who represents America and its policies in Vietnam, is a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative sent to steer the war according to America\u2019s interests, and is passionately devoted to the ideas of York Harding, an American foreign policy theorist who said that what Vietnam needed was a \"third force\" to take the place of both the colonialists and the Vietnamese rebels and restore order. Pyle sets about creating a \"Third Force\" against the French and the Viet Minh by using a Vietnamese splinter group headed by corrupt militia leader General Th\u00e9 (based on the actual [[Trinh Minh Th\u1ebf]]). His arming of Th\u00e9's militia with American weaponry leads to a series of terrorist bombings in Saigon. These bombings, dishonestly blamed on the Communists in order to further American outrage, kill a number of innocent people, including women and children.\n\nMeanwhile, Pyle has taken Fowler's Vietnamese mistress Phuong, promising her marriage and security.  When Fowler finds out about Pyle's involvement in the bombings, he takes one definitive action to seal all of their fates. He indirectly agrees to let his assistant, Hinh, and Hinh's Communist cohorts confront Pyle; when Pyle tries to flee, Hinh fatally stabs him. Phuong subsequently returns to Fowler, and while the local French police commander suspects Fowler's role in Pyle's murder, he has no evidence and does not pursue the matter.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Thomas Fowler\n* [[Brendan Fraser]] as Alden Pyle\n* [[Do Thi Hai Yen]] as Phuong\n* [[Rade \u0160erbed\u017eija]] as Inspector Vigot\n* [[Tzi Ma]] as Hinh\n* [[Robert Stanton (actor)|Robert Stanton]] as Joe Tunney\n* [[Holmes Osborne]] as Bill Granger\n* Quang Hai as General [[Tr\u00ecnh Minh Th\u1ebf]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in [[Hanoi]], [[Saigon]], [[Ninh B\u00ecnh]] and [[H\u1ed9i An]] in [[Vietnam]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe film earned positive reviews from critics, currently holding an 87% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 156 reviews, and an average rating of 7.65/10, with the consensus: \"Thoughtful and wonderfully acted, ''The Quiet American'' manages to capture the spirit of Green[e]'s novel.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1118347_quiet_american|title=The Quiet American (2003)|website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=23 September 2017}}</ref> It also has a score of 84 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]], based on 39 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-quiet-american|title=The Quiet American|website=[[Metacritic]] }}</ref>\n\nThe first rough cut was screened to a test audience on September 10, 2001 and received positive ratings. However, the [[September 11 attacks]] took place the next day, and audience ratings dropped with each subsequent screening. Reacting to criticism of the film's \"unpatriotic\" message, Miramax shelved the film for a year. It was finally screened publicly at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in September 2002 to critical acclaim. The film received an [[Oscar bait|Oscar qualification release]] in November 2002 and a limited release in January 2003.<ref name=\"thompson\"/>\n\n==Accolades==\n'''[[Academy Awards]]'''\n* [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] ([[Michael Caine]]) - Nominated\n\n'''[[Golden Globe Awards]]'''\n* [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama]] (Michael Caine) - Nominated\n\n'''[[BAFTA Awards]]'''\n* [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] (Michael Caine) - Nominated\n\n'''[[American Film Institute|American Film Institute Awards]]'''\n* Movie of the Year - '''Won'''\n\n'''[[London Film Critics' Circle|London Film Critics' Circle Awards]]'''\n* [[London Film Critics' Circle Award for Director of the Year|Director of the Year]] ([[Phillip Noyce]]) - '''Won'''\n* [[London Film Critics' Circle Award for Actor of the Year|Actor of the Year]] (Michael Caine) - '''Won'''\n\n'''[[National Board of Review]]'''\n* [[National Board of Review Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Phillip Noyce) - '''Won'''\n* [[National Board of Review: Top Ten Films|Top Ten Films]] - '''Won'''\n\n'''[[National Society of Film Critics Awards]]'''\n* [[National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Michael Caine) - 2nd place\n\n'''[[Satellite Awards]]'''\n* [[Satellite Award for Best Film|Best Motion Picture, Drama]] (Phillip Noyce) - Nominated\n* [[Satellite Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Phillip Noyce) - Nominated\n* [[Satellite Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture|Best Actor - Motion Picture, Drama]] (Michael Caine) - '''Won'''\n* [[Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture, Drama]] ([[\u0110\u1ed7 Th\u1ecb H\u1ea3i Y\u1ebfn]]) - Nominated\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of historical drama films of Asia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0258068|The Quiet American}}\n* {{Allrovi movie|272707|The Quiet American}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|1118347-quiet_american|The Quiet American}}\n* {{Mojo title|quietamerican|The Quiet American}}\n* [http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~hbf/QUIETAM.htm \"By the Bombs' Early Light\"] - essay by [[H.
