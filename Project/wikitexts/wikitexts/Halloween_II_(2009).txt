The film is a sequel to Zombie's [[Halloween (2007 film)|2007 remake]] of [[Halloween (1978 film)|1978's ''Halloween'']] and the tenth installment in the [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' franchise]].<!--The theatrical release is 1 year. The Director's Cut is 2 years. Please do not change!--> The story follows [[Laurie Strode]] as she deals with the aftermath of the previous film's events, [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Loomis]] who is trying to capitalize on those events with a new book, and [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] as he seeks to reunite with his sister. The film sees the return of lead cast members from the 2007 film [[Malcolm McDowell]], [[Scout Taylor-Compton]], and [[Tyler Mane]], who portray Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, and Michael Myers, respectively.\n\nFor ''Halloween II'', Zombie decided to focus more on the connection between Strode and Myers, and the idea that they share similar psychological problems. He wanted the sequel to be more realistic and violent than its 2007 predecessor, and to portray how the events of the first film affected the characters. Zombie also wanted to provide a glimpse into each character's psyche. Filming primarily took place in Georgia, which provided Zombie with a tax incentive as well as the visual look he was going for. When it came time to provide a musical score, Zombie had trouble finding a place to include [[John Carpenter]]'s original ''Halloween'' theme music, and it was only included in the final shot.\n\n''Halloween II'' was officially released on August 28, 2009 in [[North America]], and was met with a negative reception from critics. On October 30, 2009, it was re-released in North America to coincide with the [[Halloween]] holiday weekend. The original opening of the film grossed less than the 2007 remake, with approximately $7 million. It would go on to [[Box-office bomb|underperform at the box office]], only grossing $39.4 million worldwide against a $15 million budget.<ref>{{Cite web |title=\u2018Halloween Kills\u2019 Just Reached A Surprising Box Office Milestone |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2021/11/29/halloween-kills-just-reached-a-surprising-box-office-milestone/?sh=25db78396e7a |access-date=October 30, 2022 |website=Forbes}}</ref><ref name=\"overall\"/> Rob Zombie declined to return to film another sequel,<ref name=ScreenRant-2009-07-27>{{cite web |url= https://screenrant.com/rob-zombie-halloween-3/ |title= Rob Zombie Says 'Never' to Halloween 3 |date= 27 July 2009 |website= Screen Rant }}</ref> and the next installment, ''Halloween 3D'', was cancelled in 2012.<ref name=Collider-2012-03-08>{{cite web |url= https://collider.com/halloween-3d-release-date/ |title= HALLOWEEN 3D Removed from 2012 Release Schedule |website= Collider |date= 8 March 2012 |author= Adam Chitwood }}</ref><ref name=CB.com-2018-06-10>{{cite web |url= https://comicbook.com/horror/2018/06/10/halloween-movies-timeline-explained/ |title= The 'Halloween' Timeline Explained |author= Cameron Bonomolo |date= 9 June 2018 |publisher= Comic Book .com }}</ref> ''Halloween II'' is the final ''Halloween'' film to be distributed by Dimension Films. It was followed by ''[[Halloween (2018 film)|Halloween]]'' in 2018, a direct sequel to the original 1978 film produced by [[Blumhouse Productions]] and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nDuring his time in Smith's Grove Sanitarium, a young [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] is visited by his mother [[List of Halloween (franchise) characters#Deborah Myers|Deborah]] who gives him a white horse statuette as a gift.\n\nFifteen years later, [[Laurie Strode]] is wandering around in shock after [[Halloween (2007 film)|having shot an adult Michael]]. [[List of Halloween (franchise) characters#Sheriff Leigh Brackett|Sheriff Lee Brackett]] finds Laurie and takes her to the hospital. Meanwhile, the paramedics pick up [[Annie Brackett]] and Michael's psychiatrist [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Sam Loomis]], who survived being attacked by Michael, and also take them to the hospital. Michael's body is taken in another ambulance. When the driver has a traffic accident, Michael awakens and escapes, killing a paramedic injured in the accident.\n\nOne year later,<!--STOP! This is based on the theatrical version!--> Laurie is now living with the Bracketts. Michael has been missing and is presumed dead. While Laurie deals with her trauma, Dr. Loomis has chosen to turn the event into an opportunity to write another book. Elsewhere, Michael, who is still alive and living as a drifter, has been having visions of his mother's ghost and a younger version of himself, who instruct him to reunite with Laurie. Michael arrives at a farm and kills the owners before he sets off for Haddonfield. As Michael travels to Haddonfield, Laurie begins having hallucinations that mirrored Michael's past. Her hallucinations also begin to include her acting out Michael's murders. Meanwhile, Loomis goes on tour to promote his new book, only to be criticized by the public, who blame him for Michael's actions and for exploiting the deaths of Michael's victims. When Loomis' book is released, Laurie discovers that she is really Angel Myers, Michael's long-lost sister. She goes to a Halloween party with her co-workers, Mya and Harley, to escape how she is feeling.\n\nMichael appears at the party and kills Harley, then goes to the Brackett house and fatally wounds Annie. When Laurie and Mya return to the house, they find Annie, who dies in Laurie's arms. Michael kills Mya and then comes after Laurie, who manages to escape. Sheriff Brackett arrives home and finds his daughter dead. Laurie flags down a car, but Michael kills the driver and flips the car over with Laurie still inside. Michael then takes the unconscious Laurie to an abandoned shed. Laurie awakens to her hallucinations with Deborah, seen by both her and Michael, who asks for her to call her \"mommy\".\n\nThe police discover Michael's location and surround the shed. Loomis arrives and goes inside to try to reason with Michael but when he tries to resuscitate Laurie from her hallucinations, Michael grabs Loomis and stabs him to death before being shot through the cabin window by Brackett and impaled on a rake. Apparently released from her visions, Laurie walks over to Michael and stabs him to death with his own knife. The shed door opens and Laurie walks out wearing Michael's mask (though in the much-preferred-by-fans-[[director's cut]], Micheal is not stabbed by Laurie and instead exits the cabin to be fatally shot down by the police. Then, Laurie comes out and is shot down as well). Later, Laurie sits in isolation in a psychiatric ward, grinning as Deborah's ghost approaches with the horse statuette.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Scout Taylor-Compton]] as [[Laurie Strode|Laurie Strode / Angel Myers]]\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as [[Samuel Loomis]]\n* [[Tyler Mane]] as [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]]\n** [[Chase Wright Vanek]] as Young Michael Myers\n* [[Sheri Moon Zombie]] as Deborah Myers\n* [[Brad Dourif]] as Sheriff Lee Brackett\n* [[Danielle Harris]] as [[Annie Brackett]]\n* [[Brea Grant]] as Mya Rockwell, Laurie's new friend\n* [[Howard Hesseman]] as Uncle Meat\n* [[Angela Trimbur]] as Harley David, Laurie's new friend\n* [[Mary Birdsong]] as Nancy McDonald\n* [[Daniel Roebuck]] as Big Lou\n* [[Jeff Daniel Phillips]] as Howard Boggs and Seymour Coffins\n* [[Sylvia Jefferies]] as Misty Dawn\n* [[Bill Fagerbakke]] as Deputy Webb\n* [[Richard Brake]] as Gary Scott\n* [[Dayton Callie]] as Coroner Hooks\n* [[Margot Kidder]] as Barbara Collier\n* [[Richard Riehle]] as Buddy the Night Watchman\n* [[Mark Christopher Lawrence]] as Deputy Fred King\n* [[Mark Boone Junior]] as Floyd\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Nurse Daniels\n* [[Silas Weir Mitchell (actor)|Silas Weir Mitchell]] as Chett, the Bringer of Death\n* [[Robert Curtis Brown]] as Kyle Van Der Klok\n* [[Chris Hardwick]] as David Newman\n* [[Betsy Rue]] as Jazlean Benny\n* [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] as himself\n* [[Sean Whalen]] as Becks\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n{{quote box |quote=Don't feel hindered by any of the rules we've had in the past.

Russo pointed out that Zombie attempted to be more inventive with ''Halloween II'', but only achieved mixed results for his efforts. Russo referred to the dream sequences of Deborah Myers and the white horse as \"pretentiously silly\", but agreed that the scenes did help to break up the standard genre violence and even went so far as to compare the sensation created by those scenes to \"[[Tim Burton]] doing straight horror\". In the end, Russo claimed that \"only the most hardcore fans\" would want the film series to continue.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2009/08/29/halloween_sequel_has_few_treats/|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|title='Halloween' sequel has few treats|author=Tom Russo|date=August 29, 2009|access-date=April 12, 2010}}</ref> Joe Neumaier, of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', stated that Zombie has found himself with ''Halloween II''. Neumaier describes the film as a successful \"'character-based' monster-flick\". Zombie's use of music from the 1970s, like [[The Moody Blues]]' \"[[Nights in White Satin]]\" and [[10cc]]'s \"[[The Things We Do for Love (song)|The Things We Do for Love]]\", is \"terrifically odd\" throughout the film.
