It was based on Rader's original 1986 screenplay and stars [[Kevin Costner]], who also produced it with Charles Gordon and John Davis. It was distributed by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]].\n\nThe setting of the film is in the distant future. The [[polar ice cap]] has completely melted, and the sea level has risen over {{cvt|7600|m|-3|||}}, covering nearly all of the land. The plot of the film centers on an otherwise nameless [[antihero]], \"The Mariner\", a drifter who sails the Earth in his [[trimaran]].\n\nThe [[List of most expensive films|most expensive film]] ever made at the time, ''Waterworld'' was released to mixed reviews from critics, who praised the futuristic setting and premise, but criticized the execution including the characterization and acting performances. The film also was unable to recoup its massive budget at the box office despite being [[1995 in film|one of the highest grossing films of 1995]]; however, the film did later become profitable owing to video and other post-cinema sales. The film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in the category [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]] at the [[68th Academy Awards]].\n\nThe film's release was accompanied by a [[novelization]], [[Waterworld (video game)|video game]], and four themed attractions at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]], [[Universal Studios Singapore]], [[Universal Studios Japan]], and [[Universal Studios Beijing]] called ''[[Waterworld: A Live Sea War Spectacular]]'', all of which are still running {{As of|lc=y|2022}}.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2500,<ref>Although no exact date was given in the film itself, it has been suggested that it takes place in 2500.[''The Making of Waterworld'' by Janine Pourroy (August 1995). Production designer [[Dennis Gassner]] states: \"The date was 2500.]\"</ref> as a result of the sea levels rising over {{convert|7600|m|ft}}, every continent on Earth is now underwater. The remains of human civilization live on rugged, floating communities known as [[atolls]], having long forgotten about living on land. It is believed that a mythological \"Dryland\" exists somewhere in the endless ocean.\n\nThe Mariner, a lone drifter, arrives at an atoll on his [[trimaran]] to trade [[soil|dirt]], a rare commodity, for other supplies. When the atoll's residents see that the Mariner is a mutant, with gills and webbed feet, they decide to \"recycle\" him by drowning him in a pit of organic sludge. Suddenly, the atoll is attacked by the Smokers, a gang of pirates seeking a girl named Enola. According to their leader, the Deacon, Enola has a map to Dryland tattooed on her back. Enola's guardian, Helen, attempts to escape with Enola on a [[gas balloon]] dirigible created by Gregor, an inventor, but the balloon is released early by mistake. Helen quickly frees the Mariner and insists that he take the two of them with him.\n\nThe three escape to the open sea aboard the trimaran, pursued by the Smokers. Helen's escape results in damage to the Mariner's boat, and he angrily refuses to take her to Dryland. He then cuts her hair and then Enola's and decides to take them anyway. During their quest to find Dryland, many other events happen to the crew, such as a drifter approaching them and being killed by the Mariner after a trade, coming across a trap by the Smokers, finding a large mutated shark, and discovering Enola's drawings of various Dryland objects that the Mariner recognizes from ''[[National Geographic]]'' magazines. Later, Helen explains that she believes humans once lived on land and demands to know where the Mariner collected his dirt. He provides her with a homemade [[diving bell]] and takes her to view the underwater remains of Denver, Colorado and the soil on the ocean's floor, seeming to disprove Helen's belief. When they surface, they find that the Smokers have caught up to them, threatening to kill them if they do not hand over Enola, who is hiding aboard the boat. The Smokers abduct Enola and try to kill Helen and the Mariner. The Mariner takes Helen, and they dive underwater to avoid capture, with the Mariner's gills helping Helen breathe. When they surface, they find that his boat has been destroyed. Gregor manages to find them and he takes them to a new makeshift atoll inhabited by the survivors of the first attack using his gas balloon dirigible.\n\nThe Mariner takes a captured Smoker's [[jet ski]] to chase down the Deacon aboard the remains of the ''[[Exxon Valdez]]''. The Deacon sends the crew to start rowing the \"Deez\" after bluffingly announcing that he has decoded the map on Enola's back. With all of the Smokers below deck to row the tanker, the Mariner confronts the Deacon, threatening to ignite the oil reserves in the tanker unless he returns Enola. The Deacon calls the Mariner's bluff, knowing that it would destroy the ship, but to his surprise, the Mariner drops a [[flare]] into the oil reservoir. The ship gets engulfed in flames, and begins to sink. The Mariner rescues Enola and escapes via a rope from Gregor's balloon with Helen and the Atoll Enforcer aboard. As the Mariner brings Enola to Helen, the Deacon grabs the rope to escape the sinking ship. He is kicked off into the water but climbs aboard a jet ski. He fires upon the balloon, shaking Enola from the balloon and into the ocean. As the Deacon and some of his men converge on Enola to capture her, the Mariner makes an impromptu [[bungee jump]] from the balloon to grab Enola right before the Deacon and his men collide on their jet-skis and die in an explosion.\n\nSometime later, Gregor was able to identify the tattoo on Enola's back as coordinates with reversed directions. Following the map, Gregor, the Mariner, the Atoll Enforcer, Helen, and Enola discover Dryland, which is revealed to be the top of [[Mount Everest]], covered with vegetation and wildlife. They also find a crude hut with the remains of Enola's parents. The Mariner, feeling that he does not belong on Dryland, builds a new wooden trimaran and departs, as Helen and Enola bid him farewell.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as The Mariner\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as The Deacon\n* [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]] as Helen\n* [[Tina Majorino]] as Enola\n* [[Michael Jeter]] as Old Gregor\n* [[Gerard Murphy (Irish actor)|Gerard Murphy]] as The Nord\n* [[R.

Rader wrote the initial script in 1986 but kept it shelved until 1989. Rader cited ''Mad Max'' as a direct inspiration for the film, while also citing various [[Old Testament]] stories and the story of [[Helen of Troy]] (with the main female character being named Helen in a direct reference). It is also widely believed that inspiration was taken from ''Freakwave'' by [[Peter Milligan]] and [[Brendan McCarthy]], a \"Mad Max goes surfing\" [[comic strip]] first published by [[Pacific Comics]] in ''Vanguard Illustrated'' #1-3 (Nov. 1983-Mar. 1984), and continued by [[Eclipse Comics]] in ''Strange Days'' #1-3 (Nov. 1984-Apr. 1985). McCarthy himself had unsuccessfully tried to sell ''Freakwave'' as a movie in the early 1980s; he would go on to co-write ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]'' (2015).<ref>{{cite web |title=Cult Classic Comics: FREAKWAVE Pt. 1 |url=http://offthebeatenpanel.blogspot.com/2012/08/spotlight-freakwave-1983-1985.html |website=Off the Beaten Panel |access-date=17 April 2021 |date=August 2012 |archive-date=April 18, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418001120/http://offthebeatenpanel.blogspot.com/2012/08/spotlight-freakwave-1983-1985.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAfter several rewrites, [[Kevin Costner]] and [[Kevin Reynolds (director)|Kevin Reynolds]] joined the ''Waterworld'' production team in 1992.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Johnson|first=Kim Howard|date=September 1995|title=Rime of the Future Mariner|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-218/page/n39|magazine=[[Starlog]]|issue=218|pages=40\u201344|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> The film marked the fourth collaboration between Costner and Reynolds, who had previously worked together on [[Fandango (1985 film)|''Fandango'']] (1985), ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]'' (1991), and ''[[Rapa-Nui (film)|Rapa-Nui]]'' (1994), the latter of which Costner co-produced but did not star in.<ref name=\"Eller\">{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1994-09-16/entertainment/ca-39211_1_summer-movie |title=Plenty of Riptides on 'Waterworld' Set: With key crew people quitting and reported turmoil, logistical and organizational problems, the big-budget film, scheduled for release in summer of '95, could end up costing more than any movie ever made. |date=September 16, 1994 |first1=Claudia |last1=Eller |first2=Robert W. |last2=Welkos |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=November 20, 2014 |archive-date=December 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221132034/http://articles.latimes.com/1994-09-16/entertainment/ca-39211_1_summer-movie |url-status=live }}</ref> ''Waterworld'' was co-written by [[David Twohy]], who cited ''[[Mad Max 2|Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior]]'' as a major inspiration.

Kevin Costner did not permit his likeness to be used for the comics, so the Mariner looks different.

The comic expands on the possible cause of the melting of the polar ice caps and worldwide flood, and introduces a new villain, \"Leviathan\", who supplied the Deacon's Smoker organization. The comic hints at the possibility that the Mariner's mutation may not be caused by evolution but by genetic engineering and that his origins may be linked to those of the \"Sea Eater\", the sea monster seen during the fishing scene in the film.\n\n===Video games===\n[[Waterworld (video game)|Video games]] based on the film were released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], [[Game Boy]], [[Virtual Boy]], and [[Personal computer|PC]].
