It stars [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as a young man falsely accused of murdering his girlfriend, who uses his newly discovered paranormal abilities to uncover the real killer.\n\n''Horns'' premiered at the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival]], and was theatrically released in the United States on October 31, 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nIgnatius \"Ig\" Perrish is the prime suspect when his girlfriend, Merrin Williams, is raped and murdered. Despite his declarations of innocence, he is shunned by the community. He visits his parents and brother, Terry, to hide from the press. After a vigil led by Merrin's father, who believes Ig to be guilty, Ig gets drunk, urinates on Merrin's memorial, and wakes up with a pair of horns protruding from his head. The horns have special powers that force people to tell Ig their darkest secrets and desires. At Ig's bidding, they act upon them.\n\nWhile seeing his doctor about having the horns removed, Ig, under anesthesia, dreams of his childhood, when he first met Merrin. A young Ig and his friends play with [[cherry bomb]]s; Ig risks a dangerous dare to win a cherry bomb and nearly drowns, but is saved by Lee Tourneau, his childhood friend, who is now a lawyer. He trades the cherry bomb with Lee in exchange for fixing Merrin's broken necklace. Lee loses two fingers when the cherry bomb goes off accidentally. Ig and Merrin bond over the fixed necklace and fall in love, frequenting a treehouse in the woods together.\n\nIg visits his parents and, under the horns' power, his mother reveals that she does not want him as her son and asks him to leave. His father tells him he is worthless without Merrin and his friend helps him burn down the lab where DNA tests were being conducted. As Ig heads to a bar, in the parking lot he goads the reporters into a brawl. He attempts to find evidence proving that he did not kill Merrin from people in the bar. Several people confess their deepest and darkest secrets and the owner-bartender burns down the building to collect the insurance.\n\nFrom one confession, Ig learns a new witness in the case is a waitress at the diner where Merrin broke up with him the night she died. Ig finds her and discovers she has been fabricating her stories to become famous. When Ig talks to Terry, he learns that Terry drove Merrin from the diner the night she died. When he touches Terry, Ig sees what happened that night: Merrin left the car en route to her home and ran into the woods. Terry passed out in the car and woke up the next morning with a bloody rock in his hand, finding Merrin dead under the treehouse. Afraid that he would be implicated, he fled. Infuriated, Ig assaults Terry until he is arrested by Officer Eric Hannity, who is another childhood friend. The next morning, Ig is released from jail with Lee's help. Ig notices Lee wearing Merrin's cross necklace and questions him about it. Lee insists there are things about him and Merrin that Ig never knew.\n\nLater that night, Ig realizes snakes are following him wherever he goes and he uses them to exact vengeance against the waitress. Additionally, he gets Eric to act on his feelings for his police partner (who reciprocates his feelings) and forces Terry to overdose on drugs, causing Terry to be tormented by memories of Merrin's death. Ig meets Lee by the docks and pulls off Merrin's necklace. He realizes Lee was unable to see the horns because he was wearing the necklace. Exposed to the horns, Lee falls under their influence and admits to killing Merrin. In flashbacks, Lee was also in love with Merrin and was deeply jealous of Ig throughout their childhood. Lee followed Merrin into the woods, thinking that Merrin had been sending him signals for a long time and that she had broken up with Ig to be with him. When Merrin insisted that she loved Ig more than anyone in the world, Lee raped her in a jealous rage and killed her with a rock, stole her necklace, and planted the bloody rock on Terry. In the ensuing confrontation, Lee overpowers him and lights him on fire in his car, causing Ig to drive into the bay. Lee claims that Ig confessed to the crime and committed suicide. The horns allow Ig to survive, horrifically burned and disfigured.\n\nMerrin's father, who now believes Ig is innocent, gives Ig the key to Merrin's lockbox. When Ig puts on Merrin's cross, his body is restored and the horns disappear. In the box, he finds a note from Merrin explaining that she knew he was going to propose to her, but she was dying of cancer and did not want him to suffer, so she pushed him away under the pretense of loving someone else.\n\nIg confronts Lee, who does not remember their earlier fight, and leads him into the woods where Merrin was killed. Eric and Terry arrive to arrest Lee. Lee confesses to the murder, but then gleefully kills Eric and injures Terry. Ig tears off the necklace, sprouting a pair of wings and bursting into flame, transforming into a demonic monster. Despite Lee fatally wounding him, Ig impales Lee on one of his horns and telepathically forces a snake down Lee's throat, killing him. Saying that his vengeance was all-consuming, Ig dies from his injuries and his smoldering corpse turns to hardened ash, and he appears to be reunited with Merrin in the afterlife.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as Ignatius \"Ig\" Perrish, a 26-year-old man who wakes up after a drunken night to find two protrusions growing from his forehead, which give him the power to compel people to unravel their deepest secrets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/daniel-radcliffe-horns-movie-ryanz-187672/|title=Daniel Radcliffe to Grow 'Horns' for Supernatural Thriller|first=Robert|last=Yaniz Jr.|date=August 2012|publisher=screenrant.com|access-date=December 5, 2012}}</ref> Radcliffe stated, \"It's a very, very different type of part than anything I've done before\",<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/oct/03/daniel-radcliffe-horns|title=Daniel Radcliffe takes his career by the Horns|first=Ben|last=Child|date=October 3, 2012|work=guardian.co.uk|access-date=December 5, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/10/02/daniel-radcliffe-horns-exclusive/|title=Daniel Radcliffe reveals his devilish transformation in 'Horns' -- EXCLUSIVE FIRST LOOK|first=Lanford|last=Beard|date=October 2, 2012|publisher=insidemovies.ew.com|access-date=December 5, 2012}}</ref> adding that the role was \"deeply emotional and also incredibly outrageous in some ways\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/pop2it/2012/10/daniel-radcliffe-looks-devious-in-first-horns-image.html|title=Daniel Radcliffe looks devious in first 'Horns' image|first=Terri|last=Schwartz|date=October 3, 2012|publisher=blog.zap2it.com|access-date=December 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705073746/http://blog.zap2it.com/pop2it/2012/10/daniel-radcliffe-looks-devious-in-first-horns-image.html|archive-date=July 5, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n** Mitchell Kummen as young Ig\n* [[Max Minghella]] as Lee Tourneau, Ig's childhood best friend and now lawyer.\n** Dylan Schmid as young Lee\n* [[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]] as Terry Perrish, Ig's alcoholic, drug-addicted older brother, who is also a talented musician.\n** Jared Ager-Foster as young Terry\n* [[Juno Temple]] as Merrin Williams, Ig's deceased girlfriend, who was raped and murdered.<ref name=\"Mirror; cast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/weird-celeb-news/daniel-radcliffe-sprouts-horns-for-new-1358822|title=Horns of a dilemma: Daniel Radcliffe sprouts horns in new movie|first=Steve|last=Myall|date=October 4, 2012|publisher=mirror.co.uk|access-date=December 5, 2012}}</ref>\n** [[Sabrina Carpenter]] as young Merrin\n* [[Kelli Garner]] as Glenna\n** [[Laine MacNeil]] as young Glenna\n* [[James Remar]] as Derrick Perrish\n* [[Kathleen Quinlan]] as Lydia Perrish\n* [[Heather Graham]] as Veronica, The Waitress\n* [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]] as Dale Williams\n* [[Alex Zahara]] as Dr. Renald\n* Kendra Anderson as Delilah\n* [[Michael Adamthwaite]] as Eric Hannity, Ig's gay friend, who is now a cop.\n** Erik McNamee as young Eric\n* Desiree Zurowski as Radio reporter\n\n[[Shia LaBeouf]] was originally set to play Ig, but was later replaced with Radcliffe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://horror.about.com/b/2012/07/17/daniel-radcliffe-replaces-shia-labeouf-in-horns.htm|title=Daniel Radcliffe Replaces Shia LaBeouf in Horns|first=Mark H.|last=Harris|date=July 17, 2012|publisher=horror.about.com|access-date=December 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418220848/http://horror.about.com/b/2012/07/17/daniel-radcliffe-replaces-shia-labeouf-in-horns.htm|archive-date=April 18, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvfilmnews.com/daniel-radcliffe-signs-on-to-star-in-supernatural-thriller-horns/|title=First Look At Daniel Radcliffe in Alexandere Aja's Horns|first=Alex|last=Tucker|date=October 2, 2012|publisher=tvfilmnews.co|access-date=December 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe band seen backing up Joe Anderson's character on lead trumpet is [[The Brass Action]] from [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].
