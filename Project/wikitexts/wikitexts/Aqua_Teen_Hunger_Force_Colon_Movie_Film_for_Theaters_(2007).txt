The film was produced, written, and directed by series creators [[Matt Maiellaro]] and [[Dave Willis]], and features the voices of [[Dana Snyder]], [[Carey Means]], Willis, Maiellaro, [[Mike Schatz]], [[Andy Merrill]], [[C. Martin Croker]], and [[Neil Peart]] of the Canadian rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]], with [[Bruce Campbell]], [[Tina Fey]], [[Fred Armisen]], and [[Chris Kattan]] making special appearances. The film centers around [[Master Shake]], [[Frylock]] and [[Meatwad]], better known as the Aqua Teens, as they join forces with the [[Plutonians]] and the [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters|Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future]] to prevent a piece of exercise equipment from creating destruction, all while the Aqua Teens must puzzle together their existence and search for their creator.\n\nDuring an interview at the 2005 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], Dana Snyder and series co-creator Maiellaro stated that rumors of a feature-length film based on ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' would be made. Maiellaro would also describe the film as \"an action piece that leads into the origin story that unfolds in a very 'Aqua Teen' way.\" As production went on, several cameos, including Peart, Armisen, and Campbell, were confirmed. On April 1, 2007, Adult Swim premiered the movie just a week before the main release; however, in honor of the block's annual [[April Fools' Day]] traditions, the film remained in a small [[picture-in-picture]] box at the bottom left corner, with no sounds.\n\n''Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters'' premiered at [[New York City]] on April 10, 2007, and was released theatrically on April 13, 2007, by [[First Look Studios|First Look Pictures]], and grossed $5.5 million on a $750,000 budget, making it the [[List of highest-grossing R-rated films|twelfth highest-grossing R-rated animated film]].<ref name=\"mojo\" /> The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its humor but criticized its plot and runtime. It marks the first and only time an Adult Swim series was adapted into a feature film, and is the second [[Cartoon Network]]-owned property to receive a theatrical feature film adaptation after ''[[The Powerpuff Girls Movie]]'' (2002), with the difference being due to that film's box office failure, [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] did not distribute this film's theatrical run. [[Warner Home Video]] released the film on a two-disc DVD on August 14, 2007. The film was submitted for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] for the [[80th Academy Awards]], but was not nominated. A [[sequel]] titled ''Death Fighter'' was announced, but was ultimately scrapped in 2015. However, a second ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' film was officially confirmed by Adult Swim on May 12, 2021. The second film, titled ''[[Aqua Teen Forever: Plantasm]],'' was released direct-to-video on November 8, 2022, and then stream exclusively through [[HBO Max]] shortly afterwards.\n\n== Plot ==\nBefore the main feature, a faux theatre [[concession stand]] advertisement plays. A group of [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] theater snacks, The Soda Dog Refreshment Band, sings a spoof of ''[[Let's All Go to the Lobby]]'' until they are interrupted by another snack band (performed by [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]]). They proceed to loudly sing some of their own bizarre theater rules as a [[death metal]] song before finishing on a [[guitar solo]].\n\nThe film starts properly in [[Egypt]] in a purposely indeterminable time, where [[Master Shake]], a [[milkshake]], [[Frylock]], a box of [[french fries]], and [[Meatwad]], a ball of [[ground meat]], break free from within [[Great Sphinx of Giza|the Sphinx]] and are attacked by an oversized [[poodle]] who kills Frylock before Shake defeats it. Shake and Meatwad flee with Frylock's corpse and meet \"Time [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]\", who revives Frylock. When the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] break into his house, Time Lincoln helps the Aqua Teens escape in a wooden [[space vehicle|rocket ship]]. Time Lincoln is shot, changing history and resulting in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States of America's]] winning the [[American Civil War]], with the CIA agents being made slaves to a Black [[Kentucky]] [[Colonel]] as punishment for their crimes against [[Southern United States|the South]]. All this, however, is just an elaborate story concocted by Shake to explain their origin to Meatwad. Meanwhile, a slice of [[watermelon]] named Walter Melon observes events of the Aqua Teens from his watermelon spaceship, including a backyard [[concert]] performed by Meatwad and his dolls.\n\nWhen Shake plans to use his new exercise machine; the Insanoflex, Frylock notices that it is not assembled properly, and the instructions cannot be found. After searching for them online, he finds a message warning not to assemble the machine. Frylock calls the website's listed phone number, which is revealed to be that of [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters#Oglethorpe and Emory|Emory and Oglethorpe]], the Plutonians. Before bothering answering the phone, they discover the [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters#Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future|Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future]] on board with them. The Ghost explains to the two aliens the story of the Insanoflex: the machine, when assembled, will exercise a man into a super-being, who will attract all the women on Earth, leading to massive [[inbreeding]] and the eventual extinction of mankind. To prevent this, the Ghost [[Time Travel|travels to the past]] (not before traveling forward to [[The Bahamas]] first) and steals a [[screw]] that holds the machine together. The Plutonians, now determined to get the machine, point out to him that the screw could easily be replaced: someone can buy another screw or shove a [[pencil]] into the screw hole.\n\nBack on Earth, Frylock finishes re-building the Insanoflex with a pencil in the screw hole, but he discovers the [[printed circuit board|circuit board]] is missing. The trio visit their short-tempered, foul-mouthed, sarcastic neighbor [[Carl Brutananadilewski]], from whom Shake had stolen the machine, to see if he has the missing piece. After Carl refuses to tell them, Meatwad finds the address in the Insanoflex's box. [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters#Dr Weird|Dr. Weird]], whose abandoned asylum has been purchased and turned into a [[condominium]], is visited by Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad. Frylock retrieves the missing circuit board and installs it into the machine. Carl insists that as the rightful owner he should be the first to test the machine. The Insanoflex straps him in and transforms itself into a giant one-eyed robot. The robot plays [[techno music]] and heads for [[Center City, Philadelphia|downtown Philadelphia]], all while Carl's strapped-in form is forced to exercise. Eventually, the robot begins laying metallic eggs, which hatch into smaller versions of the machine.\n\nThe Aqua Teens, aided by an instructional workout video, find that the Insanoflex can be destroyed using music. After a failed encounter with [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters#MC Pee Pants|MC Pee Pants]] ([[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] as a [[fly]]) The Aqua Teens have no choice but to have Shake play his music. Shake poorly plays his original song \"Nude Love\" on [[acoustic guitar]], forcing the Insanoflex to commit [[suicide]]. Carl (now bulging with so much muscle) leaves with his newly found date, a [[bodybuilder]] named Linda, and they head back to her condo while the Aqua Teens try to figure out a way to stop the newly hatched machines from destroying the city.\n\nAfter a pointless time travel, the Aqua Teens travel back to Dr. Weird's condo to confront him, where Frylock begins to tell the [[origin story]] of the Aqua Teens: they were created by Dr. Weird, along with a [[chicken nugget]] named Chicken Bittle. In the [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], Dr. Weird proclaims that the Aqua Teens were created for one purpose: to crash a [[Jet aircraft|jet]] into a brick wall. Realizing the pointlessness of this mission, Frylock diverted the jet and set a course to [[Africa]], where they would try to solve world hunger. Upon entering Africa, Bittle was eaten by a [[lion]] and the presence of the Aqua Teens scare a tribe of natives. After realizing they couldn't be much help, they returned to the [[United States]] and rented a house in [[New Jersey]], where they would start their new lives as regular civilians. Shake and Meatwad do not recall their missions, due to the fact that they've been playing with their [[Game Boy]] to pay any attention.\n\nMeanwhile, Carl and Linda recline in her room, where she reveals \"herself\" to be Dr. Weird in disguise. He cuts off Carl's muscles and grafts them onto his own body. Frylock and Dr. Weird do battle while they argue back and forth about who created whom. Dr. Weird claims that it was Frylock who created him, not the other way around. Dr. Weird shows Frylock a [[teddy bear]] filled with [[razor blades]]. Shake tries to take the teddy bear, but he loses his hand. Dr. Weird then reveals that the [[blue diamond]] on Frylock's back hides a [[VCR]], in which a [[videotape]] with false memories of Dr. Weird creating Frylock had been playing in Frylock's head. Frylock also admits that he is a [[transsexual]] [[lesbian]] trapped in a man's body. Just then, Walter Melon arrives in his ship. Meatwad mentions he saw the ship earlier. Shake calls him a liar and shoots him with a shotgun. Shake gets concerned when Meatwad does not reform like always. Walter tells his partner, [[Neil Peart]], the drummer of the rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]], to play the \"[[Resurrection|Drum Solo Of Life]]\" to bring Meatwad back to life. Meanwhile, Shake tries to pick up the teddy bear for the second time, losing his other hand. Melon explains he created the Aqua Teens and all the [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters|other characters]], including the Insanoflex. His plan was that they would kill each other and Walter would inherit their [[real estate]] in order to create the \"Insano-Gym\". The others inform Walter that they rent and do not own property, proving Walter's plan pointless. Walter storms off. The Teens see their alleged mother standing before them, revealed to be a [[burrito]]. Shake suddenly [[Jumper (person)|jumps out the window]] upon hearing this news, Meatwad hugs her, and Frylock states, \"That's neat\". The movie ends with The Soda Dog Refreshment Band singing the audience out again, only for the band to insult the audience instead.\n\nIn a [[Post-credits scene|post-credit scene]], The Cybernetic Ghost is seen humping the TV in the Aqua Teens living room. Then Frylock (who went through a [[sex change]]) tells him that it's time for bed.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters}}\n* [[Dana Snyder]] as [[Master Shake]]\n* [[Carey Means]] as [[Frylock]]\n* [[Dave Willis]] as [[Meatwad]], [[Carl Brutananadilewski]], [[The Mooninites|Ignignokt]], Video Game Voice\n* [[Matt Maiellaro]] as [[The Mooninites|Err]], [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters|Cybernetic Ghost]], [[Satan]]\n* [[Andy Merrill]] as [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters|Oglethorpe]]\n* [[Mike Schatz]] as [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters|Emory]]\n* [[C.

While they dodged many questions, they confirmed that the film would run 80 minutes, be produced on a meager $750,000 budget, and feature a plot detail about a \"lost Aqua Teen\", who is a large chicken nugget named \"Chicken Bittle\" (voiced by [[Bruce Campbell]]).<ref name=\"Ain\">{{Cite web |title=Bruce Campbell As A Chicken Nugget \"Fucks!\", \"Shits!\", And \"Bleeps\" Ahoy!!

Its only reasoning behind this stunt, as stated in the advertisement, was \"because we're fucking crazy\". While Adult Swim's TV listings on its website stated the movie would be shown, other TV listings reported the same Sunday block. The stunt was, in actuality, yet another one of Adult Swim's annual [[April Fools' Day|April Fools']] pranks: though the first few minutes of the movie were shown normally, the remainder was shown in a small [[picture-in-picture]] box in the bottom left-hand corner, with no sound, over the normal programming and occasional giant pop-ups alerting viewers of its presence, as well as advertising the actual premiere. The advertising was shown again on one episode of a ''[[Family Guy]]'' marathon on July 6, 2007. The movie eventually was shown in full on Sunday, March 30, 2008. The day after the April Fools' joke, Cartoon Network showed another [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumper]], stating, \"Sorry you will still have to pay to actually see the movie.

These endings are parodies of other films. For example, one of the endings spoofs ''[[The Terminator]]'', featuring Meatwad as \"The Determinator\".\n\n== Release ==\n=== Home media ===\n{{See also|Aqua Teen Hunger Force#Home releases|l1=List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force DVDs}}\n[[Warner Home Video]] released ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters'' in a two-disc [[DVD]] edition on August 14, 2007.
