It premiered at the [[San Sebastian International Film Festival]]. The film is set in [[Manhattan]] and stars [[Radha Mitchell]] as the [[protagonist]] Melinda, in two storylines; one comic, one tragic. The film began a [[limited release]] in the United States on March 18, 2005.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe premise of the film is stated by a group of four writers conversing over dinner at the beginning of the film. The question arises: Is life naturally comic or tragic? One of the four proposes a simple story (a distraught woman knocks on a door and disrupts a dinner party) and the two prominent [[playwrights]] in the group begin telling their versions of this story, one being comic and one tragic.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Radha Mitchell]] as Melinda Robicheaux\n*[[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] as Laurel\n*[[Jonny Lee Miller]] as Lee\n*[[Will Ferrell]] as Hobie\n*[[Amanda Peet]] as Susan\n*[[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] as Ellis Moonsong\n*[[Wallace Shawn]] as Sy\n*[[Josh Brolin]] as Greg Earlinger\n*[[Vinessa Shaw]] as Stacey Fox\n*[[Steve Carell]] as Walt\n*[[Arija Bareikis]] as Sally Oliver\n*[[Matt Servitto]] as Jack Oliver\n*[[Zak Orth]] as Peter\n*[[Brooke Smith (actress)|Brooke Smith]] as Cassie\n*[[Daniel Sunjata]] as Billy Wheeler\n*[[Larry Pine]] as Max\n*[[Andy Borowitz]] as Doug\n{{div col end}}\n[[Radha Mitchell]] plays Melinda in both versions. [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]], [[Jonny Lee Miller]], and [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] star with her in the tragedy, while [[Will Ferrell]] and [[Amanda Peet]] star with her in the comedy. [[Steve Carell]] has a small part as Ferrell's character's friend.\n\n==Production==\n[[Woody Allen]] said in ''Conversations with Woody Allen'' that he wanted to cast [[Winona Ryder]] in the title role.  He had to replace her with [[Radha Mitchell]] because no one would insure Ryder due to her arrest for shoplifting \u2013 this would have made it impossible to obtain a film [[completion bond]]. Allen stated he was sad because he had written the part for Ryder after working with her on ''[[Celebrity (1998 film)|Celebrity]]''. In the same interview, he also claimed to have intended Ferrell's part for [[Robert Downey, Jr.]], but, again, insurance got in the way due to Downey's history of arrests and drug abuse.\n\nThe film also stars [[Wallace Shawn]] (alluding to his dinner-philosophy argument in ''[[My Dinner with Andre]]'') as the comic playwright, [[Larry Pine]] as the tragedian, and [[Brooke Smith (actress)|Brooke Smith]] as Cassie. All three had appeared in the 1994 film ''[[Vanya on 42nd Street]],'' directed by [[Louis Malle]].\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] lists a 51% positive score, based on 144 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/melinda_and_melinda/ |title=Melinda and Melinda \u2013 Movie Reviews, Trailers, Pictures \u2013 Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=February 12, 2008 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |archive-date=February 13, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213170359/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/melinda_and_melinda/ |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Metacritic]] reported the film had an average score of 54 out of 100, based on 40 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/melindaandmelinda |title=Melinda and Melinda (2005): Reviews |access-date=February 12, 2008 |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |archive-date=March 3, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303050652/http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/melindaandmelinda |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film two stars, calling it \"meandering,\u201d with \"echoes... of earlier, better Allen movies\".<ref>Maltin, Leonard (2009), p. 898.
