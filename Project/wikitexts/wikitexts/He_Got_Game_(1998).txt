The film revolves around Jake Shuttlesworth ([[Denzel Washington]]), father of the top-ranked [[basketball]] prospect in the country, Jesus Shuttlesworth ([[Ray Allen]]). Jake, in prison for killing his wife, is released on [[parole]] for a week by the state's governor to persuade his son to play for the governor's [[alma mater]] in exchange for a reduced prison sentence.\n\n== Plot ==\nJesus Shuttlesworth, the top high-school basketball player in the United States, is being pursued by the top college basketball programs in the nation. His father, Jake, is a convicted felon serving time at [[Attica Correctional Facility]] for accidentally killing his wife, Martha, Jesus' mother, six years earlier. Jake is temporarily released by the governor, an influential alumnus of \"Big State,\" one of the colleges Jesus is considering, so that he might persuade his son to sign with the governor's college. If successful, he'll get an early release from prison.\n\nUpon his first moments outside of prison, Jake contacts his daughter, Mary Shuttlesworth, who is happy to see him. When Jesus returns home from school, he refuses to look his father in the eye, and tells his sister to get rid of the \"stranger\" in their living room. Jesus later agrees to meet with his father at an alternative location away from Mary. Throughout the movie, Jake tries to persuade Jesus to attend Big State with seemingly no success. Eventually, he divulges the deal set up by the governor. However, Jesus appears to be unsympathetic to his father's situation.\n\nFlashbacks illustrate the younger Jesus' grueling basketball training under his father, and the night an argument between Jake and Jesus escalated into violence, resulting in Jake accidentally killing Jesus' mother after she intervened.\n\nIntertwined with the story of the Shuttlesworth family is the sub-plot of Dakota Barns, a prostitute who stays in the room next to Jake in the run-down hotel, which the warden has booked for him. Dakota is being abused by her procurer and companion, Sweetness, which Jake overhears through the thin walls. Throughout the film, Jake is seen helping Dakota by cleaning her wounds and giving her some of his money to be used for his expenses during his week out of prison. He also develops a romantic relationship with her. Dakota is seen in one of the final scenes of the movie taking a Greyhound bus away from [[New York City]].\n\nJesus is tempted with offers of cash and women on recruiting visits to big-time basketball programs. He also considers entering the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] in order to play professionally sooner and immediately lift himself and his sister out of poverty. Jake finally challenges Jesus to a game of one-on-one basketball. If Jake wins, Jesus will sign a letter of intent to play for Big State and if Jesus wins, he can make his own decision. After a competitive start, Jake tires during the course of the game and Jesus wins. As Jake is collected for transportation back to Attica, he turns to Jesus and says, \"Let me tell you something, son: You get that hatred out your heart, or you'll end up just another nigga ... like your father.\"\n\nUltimately, Jesus decides to sign to play for Big State and gives Jake his blessing. However, the governor does not give Jake the promised reduction, as Jesus did not sign the letter of intent, and Jake's work-release is fabricated in the media as an escape from prison before being recaptured. Jake ultimately finds freedom by casting away his dreams and burdens to his son, Jesus, symbolized by the throwing of his old basketball over the prison wall and magically onto the Big State court where Jesus is practicing alone.  Jesus clutches the ball, knowing it is a message of hope from his father.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as Jake Shuttlesworth\n* [[Ray Allen]] as Jesus Shuttlesworth\n**[[Jade Yorker]] as Jesus Shuttlesworth (age 12)\n* [[Milla Jovovich]] as Dakota Barns\n* [[John Turturro]] as Coach Billy Sunday\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Lala Bonilla\n* [[Jim Brown]] as Spivey\n* Joseph Lyle Taylor as Crudup\n* [[Hill Harper]] as Coleman \"Booger\" Sykes\n** Shortee Reed as Coleman \"Booger\" Sykes (age 12)\n* [[Zelda Harris]] as Mary Shuttlesworth\n** Quinn Harris as Mary Shuttlesworth (age 6)\n* [[Ned Beatty]] as Warden Marcel Wyatt\n* [[Bill Nunn]] as Uncle Bubba\n* Michele Shay as Aunt Sally\n* [[Thomas Jefferson Byrd]] as \"Sweetness\"\n* [[Roger Guenveur Smith]] as Willie \"Big Time Willie\"\n* [[Lonette McKee]] as Martha Shuttlesworth\n* [[Travis Best]] as Sip\n* [[Walter McCarty]] as Mance\n* [[Kim Director]] as Lynn\n* [[John Wallace (basketball)|John Wallace]] as Lonnie\n* [[Rick Fox]] as Chick Deagan\n* [[Leonard Roberts]] as D'Andre Mackey\n* [[Jennifer Esposito]] as Ms. Janus\n* Tiffany Jones as Buffy\n* [[Jill Kelly (actress)|Jill Kelly]] as Suzie\n* Al Palagonia as Dom Pagnotti\n* [[Arthur J.

Locations included [[Coney Island, Brooklyn]], [[Cabrini&ndash;Green|Cabrini&ndash;Green housing projects]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], [[Elon University]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], and [[Los Angeles, California]].\n\nFor the role of Jesus, Lee had drawn up a list of every NBA player who could pass for a high school senior. [[Kobe Bryant]] was the original choice to portray Jesus Shuttlesworth, but after shooting several air balls that resulted in a brutal playoff loss to the Utah Jazz in the [[1997 NBA Playoffs]], he planned an extensive workout plan that would help maintain his strength throughout the duration of the longer NBA seasons. Lee found [[Tracy McGrady]] too reserved and was not impressed by [[Allen Iverson]]'s performance. Management for [[Kevin Garnett]] and [[Stephon Marbury]] wanted a guarantee that one or the other would be offered the part. [[Travis Best]], [[Walter McCarty]], and [[Rick Fox]] also auditioned, and Lee cast them in supporting roles.  Lee approached Allen during halftime of a Bucks-[[New York Knicks|Knicks]] game, ultimately offering him the role of Jesus. Allen had never acted before, and he trained with an acting coach for eight weeks prior to filming.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thisdistractedglobe.com/2008/05/12/he-got-game-1998-2/ |title=He Got Game (1998) |publisher=Thisdistractedglobe.com |date=2008-05-12 |access-date=2010-08-19 |archive-date=2014-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109050931/http://thisdistractedglobe.com/2008/05/12/he-got-game-1998-2/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nNBA players [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Reggie Miller]], [[Bill Walton]], [[Scottie Pippen]], [[Michael Jordan]], and [[Charles Barkley]], [[Syracuse University]] coach [[Jim Boeheim]], NBA coaches [[Rick Pitino]] and [[George Karl]] and broadcaster [[Dick Vitale]] made cameo appearances at one point early in the film.<ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGW-36kQzNo |title=Jesus Shuttlesworth |publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=2010-08-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227185927/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGW-36kQzNo |archive-date=February 27, 2013 }}</ref>\nFormer football legend [[Jim Brown]] also appears as one of Jake's parole officers, assigned to keep tabs on him while he's away from the prison.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\n''He Got Game'' was produced on an estimated $25 million budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/26/movies/film-looking-into-the-shadows-at-courtside.html|title=FILM; Looking Into the Shadows at Courtside|last=Wise|first=Mike|date=1998-04-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-09-26|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In the opening weekend of its release, it was shown on 1,319 screens, and took in $7,610,663 at the U.S. box offices debuting at #1.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1998&wknd=18&p=.htm|title=Weekend Box Office Results for May 1-3, 1998 - Box Office Mojo|website=www.boxofficemojo.com}}</ref> It eventually grossed a total of $21,554,585.00, which was a box office flop considering it fell short of its $25 million budget.\n\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 81% based on 63 reviews, with an average rating of 6.87/10.
