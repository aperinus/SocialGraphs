The film is based on the true story of [[Robert Hanssen]], an [[FBI]] agent convicted of spying for the [[Soviet Union]] and later [[Russia]] for more than two decades. It stars [[Chris Cooper]] as Hanssen and [[Ryan Phillippe]] as [[Eric O'Neill]], the FBI agent who helped bring about his downfall. The film received generally positive reviews and grossed $41 million on a $23 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Eric O'Neill]] is a young [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] employee assigned to work undercover as a clerk to [[Robert Hanssen]], a senior agent he is told is suspected of being a [[sexual deviant]]. Hanssen has been recalled from a detail post at the [[State Department]] to FBI headquarters ostensibly to head up a new division specializing in [[Information Assurance]].\n\nInitially, Hanssen insists on a strict formality between the two men. He frequently rails against the bureaucracy of the FBI and complains that only those who regularly \"shoot guns\" are considered for senior positions instead of those, like himself, who are involved in vital national security matters. He calls the bureau's information technology systems antiquated and laments the lack of coordination and information exchange with other intelligence agencies.\n\nEventually, Hanssen becomes a friend and mentor to O'Neill and takes a personal interest in him and his wife Juliana, who is suspicious of Hanssen and resents his intrusions. A devout [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] who is also a member of [[Opus Dei]], Hanssen urges O'Neill, a lapsed Catholic, and his secular [[East German]]-born wife to become active churchgoers.\n\nO'Neill finds no evidence of Hanssen leading a secret double life and develops a growing respect for his boss, leading him to confront his handler in the undercover assignment, Kate Burroughs. She admits that the sexual deviance allegations are only a secondary consideration and that Hanssen is suspected of having spied for the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Russia]] for years and being responsible for the deaths of agents working for the United States. The entire Information Assurance Division that Hanssen now heads was created specifically to lure him away from his previous job as liaison to the State Department, and his office was specially constructed with hidden surveillance equipment. The investigation already includes fifty agents, and is personally overseen by FBI Director [[Louis Freeh]], who has been reading O'Neill's reports on Hanssen.\n\nAlthough the FBI already has enough evidence to arrest Hanssen, Director Freeh wants to catch Hanssen in the act of making a drop so that their case against him will be airtight, ensuring that he will cooperate once arrested and not retaliate by exposing more undercover agents and informants. O'Neill is ordered to obtain data from Hanssen's [[Palm Pilot]] and keep him occupied while FBI agents search his car and plant covert listening devices in it.\n\nThe tracking devices in Hanssen's car cause interference with the radio, which makes Hanssen suspicious. He also wonders why he was placed in an isolated position in the FBI only a few months before he is scheduled to retire. He tells O'Neill he believes he is being watched by Russian agents. The FBI intercepts a message he sends to his Russian handlers saying he will not provide any more information. O'Neill convinces Hanssen that he is not being trailed by the Russians or by him on behalf of the FBI. With his confidence restored, Hanssen makes one last [[dead drop]] of stolen information and the FBI catches him in the act.\n\nAlthough he is assured promotion, O'Neill is discouraged by the toll the case has taken on his marriage and opts to leave the agency. When O'Neill leaves his office with his belongings, he unexpectedly encounters Hanssen in an elevator being escorted by arresting officers. A tearful Hanssen asks O'Neill to [[intercession|pray on his behalf]], and O'Neill promises he will.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Chris Cooper]] as [[Robert Hanssen]]\n* [[Ryan Phillippe]] as [[Eric O'Neill]]\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Kate Burroughs\n* [[Caroline Dhavernas]] as Juliana O'Neill\n* [[Gary Cole]] as Rich Garces\n* [[Dennis Haysbert]] as Dean Plesac\n* [[Kathleen Quinlan]] as Bonnie Hanssen\n* Despina Caldis as Vanna O'Neill\n* [[Bruce Davison]] as John O'Neill\n* [[Jonathan Watton]] as Geddes\n}}\n\n==Accuracy==\n{{anchor|breach_accuracy}}\n<!-- other pages link to this section. -->\nThe filmmakers fictionalized much of Eric O'Neill's story, as mentioned in the end credits.
